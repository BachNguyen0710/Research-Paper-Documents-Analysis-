10.1101/055681,Biogeographic Ancestry and Socioeconomic Outcomes in the Americas: a Meta-analysis,"Kirkegaard, E. O. W.; Wang, M.; Fuerst, J.",John  Fuerst,2017-03-01,scientific communication and education,"Narrative reports suggest that socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with biogeographic ancestry (BGA) in the Americas. If so, SES potentially acts as a confound that needs to be taken into account when evaluating the relation between medical outcomes and BGA. To explore how systematic BGA-SES associations are, a meta-analysis of American studies was conducted. 41 studies were identified, yielding a total of 64 independent samples with directions of associations, including 48 independent samples with effect sizes. An analysis of association directions found a high degree of consistency. The square root n-weighted directions were 0.83 (K = 36), -0.81 (K = 41) and -0.82 (K = 39) for European, Amerindian and African BGA, respectively. An analysis of effect size magnitudes found that European BGA was positively associated with SES, with a meta-analytic effect size of r = .18 [95% CI: .13 to .24, K = 28, n = 35,476.50], while both Amerindian and African BGA were negatively associated with SES, having meta-analytic effect sizes of -.14 [-.18 to -.10, k =31, n = 28,937.50] and -.11 [-.15 to -.07, K = 28, n = 32,710.50], respectively. There was considerable cross-sample variation in effect sizes (mean I2 = 92%), but the sample size was not enough for performing credible moderator analysis. Implications for future studies are discussed."
10.1101/058511,Learning from critical care management of sheep receiving extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation for smoke-induced acute lung injury as a tool for processing large clinical datasets,"Chemonges, S.",Saul  Chemonges,2019-07-11,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundNumerous successful therapies developed for human medicine involve animal experimentation. Animal studies that are focused solely on translational potential, may not sufficiently document unexpected outcomes. Considerable amounts of data from such studies could be used to advance veterinary science. For example, sheep are increasingly being used as models of intensive care and therefore, data arising from such models must be published. In this study, the hypothesis is that there is little information describing cardiorespiratory physiological data from sheep models of intensive care and the author aimed to analyse such data to provide biological information that is currently not available for sheep that received extracorporeal life support (ECLS) following acute smoke-induced lung injury.

MethodsNineteen mechanically ventilated adult ewes undergoing intensive care during evaluation of a form of ECLS (treatment) for acute lung injury were used to collate clinical observations. Eight sheep were injured by acute smoke inhalation prior to treatment (injured/treated), while another eight were not injured but treated (uninjured/treated). Two sheep were injured but not treated (injured/untreated), while one received room air instead of smoke as the injury and was not treated (placebo/untreated). The data were then analysed for 11 physiological categories and compared between the two treated groups.

ResultsCompared with the baseline, treatment contributed to and exacerbated the deterioration of pulmonary pathology by reducing lung compliance and the arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) ratio. The oxygen extraction index changes mirrored those of the PaO2/FiO2 ratio. Decreasing coronary perfusion pressure predicted the severity of cardiopulmonary injury.

ConclusionsThese novel observations could help in understanding similar pathology such as that which occurs in animal victims of smoke inhalation from house or bush fires, aspiration pneumonia secondary to tick paralysis and in the management of the severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in humans."
10.1101/061200,A signal detection theoretic argument against claims of unmeritocratic faculty hiring,"Miuccio, M. T.; Liu, K.-y.; Lau, H.; Peters, M. A. K.",Megan A. K. Peters,2017-02-16,scientific communication and education,"To get a faculty job, graduating doctoral students have to substantially outperform their peers, given the competitive nature of the academic job market. In an ideal, meritocratic world, factors such as prestige of degree-granting university ought not to play a substantial role. However, it has recently been reported that top-ranked universities produced about 2-6 times more faculty than did universities that were ranked lower (Clauset, Arbesman, and Larremore 2015), necessitating un-meritocratic factors: how could students from top-ranked universities be six times more productive than their peers from lower-ranked universities? Here we present a signal detection model to demonstrate that substantially higher rates of faculty production need not require substantially (and unrealistically) higher levels of student productivity. Instead, it is a high hiring threshold due to keen competition that causes small difference in average student productivity between universities to result in manifold differences in placement rates. Under this framework, the previously reported results are compatible with a purely meritocratic system. As a simple proof of concept, we examined the association between university ranking and the impact factors of students publications from a small selected sample of psychology departments in the U.S. The results are in agreement with our theoretical model. Whereas these results do not necessarily mean that the actual faculty hiring market is purely meritocratic, they highlight the difficulty in empirically demonstrating that it is not so."
10.1101/070631,Gender disparity in computational biology research publications,"Bonham, K. S.; Stefan, M. I.",Kevin S. Bonham,2017-04-13,scientific communication and education,"While women are generally underrepresented in STEM fields, there are noticeable differences between fields. For instance, the gender ratio in biology is more balanced than in computer science. We were interested in how this difference is reflected in the interdisciplinary field of computational/quantitative biology. To this end, we examined the proportion of female authors in publications from the PubMed and arXiv databases. There are fewer female authors on research papers in computational biology, as compared to biology in general. This is true across authorship position, year, and journal impact factor. A comparison with arXiv shows that quantitative biology papers have a higher ratio of female authors than computer science papers, placing computational biology in between its two parent fields in terms of gender representation. Both in biology and in computational biology, a female last author increases the probability of other authors on the paper being female, pointing to a potential role of female PIs in influencing the gender balance."
10.1101/069468,How do Research Faculty in the Biosciences Evaluate Paper Authorship Criteria?,"Kassis, T.",Timothy  Kassis,2017-04-27,scientific communication and education,"Authorship of peer-reviewed journal articles and abstracts has become the primary currency and reward unit in academia. Such a reward is crucial for students and postdocs who are often under-compensated and thus highly value authorship as an incentive. While numerous scientific and publishing organizations have written guidelines for determining author qualifications and author order, there remains much ambiguity when it comes to how these criteria are weighed by research faculty. Here, we sought to provide some initial insight on how faculty view the relative importance of 11 criteria for scientific authorship. We distributed an online survey to 564 biomedical engineering, biology, and bioengineering faculty members at 10 research institutions across the United States. The response rate was approximately 18%, resulting in a final sample of 102 respondents. Results revealed a consensus on some criteria, such as time spent conducting experiments, but there was a lack of agreement regarding the role of funding procurement. This study provides quantitative assessments of how faculty members in the biosciences evaluate authorship criteria. We discuss the implications of these findings for researchers, especially new graduate students, to help navigate the discrepancy between official policies for authorship and the contributions that faculty truly value."
10.1101/088278,Ten simple rules for structuring papers,"Kording, K. P.; Mensh, B.",Konrad P Kording,2017-05-23,scientific communication and education,"Good scientific writing is essential to career development and to the progress of science. A well-structured manuscript allows readers and reviewers to get excited about the subject matter, to understand and verify the papers contributions, and to integrate these contributions into a broader context. However, many scientists struggle with producing high-quality manuscripts and typically get little training in paper writing. Focusing on how readers consume information, we present a set of 10 simple rules to help you get across the main idea of your paper. These rules are designed to make your paper more influential and the process of writing more efficient and pleasurable."
10.1101/093518,Data Reuse as a Prisoner’s Dilemma: the social capital of open science,"Alicea, B.",Bradly  Alicea,2017-01-19,scientific communication and education,"Participation in open data initiatives require two semi-independent actions: the sharing of data produced by a researcher or group, and a consumer of shared data. Consumers of shared data range from people interested in validating the results of a given study to people who actively transform the available data. These data transformers are of particular interest because they add value to the shared data set through the discovery of new relationships and information which can in turn be shared with the same community. The complex and often reciprocal relationship between producers and consumers can be better understood using game theory, namely by using three variations of the Prisoners Dilemma (PD): a classical PD payoff matrix, a simulation of the PD n-person iterative model that tests three hypotheses, and an Ideological Game Theory (IGT) model used to formulate how sharing strategies might be implemented in a specific institutional culture. To motivate these analyses, data sharing is presented as a trade-off between economic and social payoffs. This is demonstrated as a series of payoff matrices describing situations ranging from ubiquitous acceptance of Open Science principles to a community standard of complete non-cooperation. Further context is provided through the IGT model, which allows from the modeling of cultural biases and beliefs that influence open science decision-making. A vision for building a CC-BY economy are then discussed using an approach called econosemantics, which complements the treatment of data sharing as a complex system of transactions enabled by social capital."

10.1101/103093,Documenting and Evaluating Data Science Contributions in Academic Promotion in Departments of Statistics and Biostatistics,"Waller, L. A.",Lance A. Waller,2017-01-25,scientific communication and education,"ABSTACTThe dynamic intersection of the emerging field of Data Science with the established academic communities of Statistics and Biostatistics continues to generate lively debate, often with the two fields playing the role of an upstart (but brilliant), tech-savvy prodigy and an established (but brilliant), curmudgeonly expert, respectively. Like any new discipline, Data Science brings new perspectives and new tools to address new questions requiring new perspectives on traditionally established concepts. In this paper, we explore a specific component of this discussion, namely the documentation and evaluation of Data Science-related research, teaching, and service contributions for faculty members seeking promotion and tenure within traditional departments of statistics and Biostatistics."
10.1101/103895,Is Democracy the Right System? Collaborative Approaches to Building an Engaged RDM Community,"Teperek, M.; Higman, R.; Kingsley, D.",Marta  Teperek,2017-01-28,scientific communication and education,"When developing new products, tools or services, one always need to think about the end users to ensure a wide-spread adoption. While this applies equally to services developed at higher education institutions, sometimes these services are driven by policies and not by needs of end users. This policy-driven approach can prove challenging for building effective community engagement. The initial development of Research Data Management support services at the University of Cambridge was policy-driven and subsequently failed in the first instance to engage the community of researchers for whom these services were created.\n\nIn this practice paper we will describe the initial approach undertaken at Cambridge when developing RDM services, the results of this approach and lessons learnt. We will then provide an overview of alternative, democratic strategies employed and their positive effects on community engagement. We will summarise by performing a cost-benefit analysis of the two approaches. This paper might be a useful case study for any institutions aiming to develop central support services for researchers, with conclusions applicable to the wide sector, and extending beyond Research Data Management services."
10.1101/108357,The Rise of the Middle Author: Investigating Collaboration and Division of Labor in Biomedical Research using Partial Alphabetical Authorship,"Mongeon, P.; Smith, E.; Joyal, B.; Lariviere, V.",Philippe  Mongeon,2017-02-14,scientific communication and education,"Contemporary biomedical research is performed by increasingly large teams. As a consequence, an increasingly large number of individuals are being listed as authors in the byline of biomedical articles, which complicates the proper attribution of credit and responsibility to individual authors for their work. Typically, more importance is given to the first and last authors of biomedical papers, and the others (the middle authors) are considered to have made smaller contributions. However, we argue that this distinction between first, middle and last authors does not properly reflect the actual division of labor and does not allow a fair allocation of credit among the members of the research teams. In this paper, we use partial alphabetical authorship to divide the authors of all biomedical articles in the Web of Science published over the 1980-2015 period in three groups: primary authors, middle authors, and supervisory authors. We show that alphabetical ordering of middle authors is frequent in biomedical research, and that the prevalence of this practice is positively correlated with the number of authors in the bylines. We also find that, for articles with 7 or more authors, the average proportion of team members in each group is independent of the team size, more than half of the authors being middle authors. This suggests that growth in authors lists are not due to an increase in secondary contributions but, rather, in equivalent increases of all types of roles and contributions. Nevertheless, we show that the relative contribution of middle authors to the overall production of knowledge in the biomedical field as increased dramatically over the last 35 years."

BIO PIs considered a range of computational needs important to their work--including high performance computing (HPC), bioinformatics support, multi-step workflows, updated analysis software, and the ability to store, share, and publish data. Previous studies in the United States and Canada emphasized infrastructure needs. However, BIO PIs said the most pressing unmet needs are training in data integration, data management, and scaling analyses for HPC--acknowledging that data science skills will be required to build a deeper understanding of life. This portends a growing data knowledge gap in biology and challenges institutions and funding agencies to redouble their support for computational training in biology."
10.1101/108480,"Biomedical Text Mining for Research Rigor and Integrity: Tasks, Challenges, Directions","Kilicoglu, H.",Halil  Kilicoglu,2017-02-14,scientific communication and education,"An estimated quarter of a trillion US dollars is invested in the biomedical research enterprise annually. There is growing alarm that a significant portion of this investment is wasted, due to problems in reproducibility of research findings and in the rigor and integrity of research conduct and reporting. Recent years have seen a flurry of activities focusing on standardization and guideline development to enhance the reproducibility and rigor of biomedical research. Research activity is primarily communicated via textual artifacts, ranging from grant applications to journal publications. These artifacts can be both the source and the end result of practices leading to research waste. For example, an article may describe a poorly designed experiment, or the authors may reach conclusions not supported by the evidence presented. In this article, we pose the question of whether biomedical text mining techniques can assist the stakeholders in the biomedical research enterprise in doing their part towards enhancing research integrity and rigor. In particular, we identify four key areas in which text mining techniques can make a significant contribution: plagiarism/fraud detection, ensuring adherence to reporting guidelines, managing information overload, and accurate citation/enhanced bibliometrics. We review the existing methods and tools for specific tasks, if they exist, or discuss relevant research that can provide guidance for future work. With the exponential increase in biomedical research output and the ability of text mining approaches to perform automatic tasks at large scale, we propose that such approaches can add checks and balances that promote responsible research practices and can provide significant benefits for the biomedical research enterprise.\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary material is available at BioRxiv."

K.",Peter K Sorger,2017-02-16,scientific communication and education,"The creation of datasets that are findable, accessible, interoperable and reproducible (the FAIR standard) requires that data provenance be maintained1. Provenance is particularly important for microscopy data, whose interpretation is dependent on the biological context (e.g. cell state) and detection reagent (e.g. antibody.)

10.1101/109017,Reproducibility2020: Progress and Priorities,"Freedman, L.; Venugopalan, G.; Wisman, R.",Leonard  Freedman,2017-02-16,scientific communication and education,"The preclinical research process is a cycle of idea generation, experimentation, and reporting of results. The biomedical research community relies on the reproducibility of published discoveries to create new lines of research and to translate research findings into therapeutic applications. Since 2012, when scientists from Amgen reported that they were able to reproduce only 6 of 53 \""landmark\"" preclinical studies, the biomedical research community began discussing the scale of the reproducibility problem and developing initiatives to address critical challenges. GBSI released the \""Case for Standards\"" in 2013, one of the first comprehensive reports to address the rising concern of irreproducible biomedical research. Further attention was drawn to issues that limit scientific self-correction including reporting and publication bias, underpowered studies, lack of open access to methods and data, and lack of clearly defined standards and guidelines in areas such as reagent validation. To evaluate the progress made towards reproducibility since 2013, GBSI identified and examined initiatives designed to advance quality and reproducibility. Through this process, we identified key roles for funders, journals, researchers and other stakeholders and recommended actions for future progress. This paper describes our findings and conclusions."
10.1101/108027,The impact factor fallacy,"Paulus, F. M.; Cruz, N.; Krach, S.",Frieder Michel Paulus,2017-02-20,scientific communication and education,"The use of the journal impact factor (JIF) as a measure for the quality of individual manuscripts and the merits of scientists has faced significant criticism in recent years. We add to the current criticism in arguing that such an application of the JIF in policy and decision making in academia is based on false beliefs and unwarranted inferences. To approach the problem, we use principles of deductive and inductive reasoning to illustrate the fallacies that are inherent to using journal based metrics for evaluating the work of scientists. In doing so, we elaborate that if we judge scientific quality based on the JIF or other journal based metrics we are either guided by invalid or weak arguments or in fact consider our uncertainty about the quality of the work and not the quality itself."
10.1101/104661,Creating a Community of Data Champions,"Higman, R.; Teperek, M.; Kingsley, D.",Rosie  Higman,2017-02-20,scientific communication and education,"Research Data Management (RDM) presents an unusual challenge for service providers in Higher Education. There is increased awareness of the need for training in this area but the nature of discipline-specific practices involved make it difficult to provide training across a multi-disciplinary organisation. Whilst most UK universities now have a research data team of some description, they are often small and rarely have the resources necessary to provide targeted training to the different disciplines and research career stages that they are increasingly expected to support.\n\nThis practice paper describes the approach taken at the University of Cambridge to address this problem by creating a community of Data Champions. This collaborative initiative, working with researchers to provide training and advocacy for good RDM practice, allows for more discipline-specific training to be given, researchers to be credited for their expertise and an opportunity for those interested in RDM to exchange knowledge with others. The  community of practice model has been used in many sectors, including Higher Education, to facilitate collaboration across organisational units and this initiative will adopt some of the same principles to improve communication across a decentralised institution. The Data Champions initiative at Cambridge was launched in September 2016 and this paper reports on the early months, plans for building the community in the future and the possible risks associated with this approach to providing RDM services."

However, the results of conventional RCTs cannot show individual therapeutic efficacy and safety for medical intervention to a targeted patient. It is the most important weak point of conventional RCTs.

C.; Bastian, H.",Melissa  Vaught,2017-02-27,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundAn editorial expression of concern (EEoC) is issued by editors or publishers to draw attention to potential problems in a publication, without itself constituting a retraction or correction.\n\nMethodsWe searched PubMed, PubMed Central (PMC), and Google Scholar to identify EEoCs issued for publications in PubMed and PMC up to 22 August 2016. We also searched the archives of the Retraction Watch blog, some journal and publisher websites, and studies of EEoCs. In addition, we searched for retractions of EEoCs and affected articles in PubMed up to 8 December 2016. We analyzed overall historical trends, as well as reported reasons and subsequent editorial actions related to EEoCs issued between August 2014 and August 2016.\n\nResultsAfter screening 5,076 records, we identified 230 EEoCs that affect 300 publications indexed in PubMed, the earliest issued in 1985. Half of the primary EEoCs were issued between 2014 and 2016 (52%). We found evidence of some EEoCs that had been removed by the publisher without leaving a record and some were not submitted for PubMed or PMC indexing. A minority of publications affected by EEoCs had been retracted by early December 2016 (25%). For the subset of 92 EEoCs issued between August 2014 and August 2016, affecting 99 publications, the rate of retraction was similar (29%). The majority of EEoCs were issued because of concerns with validity of data, methods, or interpretation of the publication (68%), and 31% of cases remained open. Issues with images were raised in 40% of affected publications. Ongoing monitoring after the study identified another 17 EEoCs to years end in 2016, increasing the number of EEoCs to 247 and publications in PubMed known to be affected by EEoCs to 320 at the end of 2016.\n\nConclusionsEEoCs have been rare publishing events in the biomedical literature, but their use has been increasing. Most have not led to retractions, and many remain unresolved. Lack of prominence and inconsistencies in management of EEoCs reduce the ability of these notices to alert the scientific community to potentially serious problems in publications. EEoCs will be made identifiable in PubMed in 2017."

K.",Michelle D Brazas,2017-02-27,scientific communication and education,"In the last decade, life-science research has become increasingly data-intensive and computational. Nevertheless, basic bioinformatics and data stewardship are still only rarely taught in life-science degree programmes, creating a widening skills gap that spans educational levels and career roles. To better understand this situation, we ran surveys to determine how the skills dearth is affecting the need for bioinformatics training worldwide. Perhaps unsurprisingly, we found that respondents wanted more short courses to help boost their expertise and confidence in data analysis and interpretation. However, it was evident that most respondents appreciated their need for training only after designing their experiments and collecting their data. This is clearly rather late in the research workflow, and suboptimal from a training perspective, as skills acquired to address a specific need at a particular time are seldom retained, engendering a cycle of low confidence in trainees. To ensure that such skill gaps do not continue to create barriers to the progress of research, we argue that universities should strive to bring their life-science curricula into the digital-data era. Meanwhile, the demand for point-of-need training in bioinformatics and data stewardship will grow. While this situation persists, international groups like GOBLET are increasing their efforts to enlarge the community of trainers and quench the global thirst for bioinformatics training."

M.; Singer, M.; Pagliarulo, C.",Erin A Becker,2017-03-08,scientific communication and education,"Evidence-based teaching is a highly complex skill, requiring repeated cycles of deliberate practice and feedback to master. Despite existing well characterized frameworks for practice-based training in K-12 teacher education, the major principles of these frameworks have not yet been transferred to instructor development in higher educational contexts, including training of graduate teaching assistants (GTAs). We sought to determine whether a practice-based training program could help GTAs learn and use evidence-based teaching methods in their classrooms. We implemented a weekly training program for introductory biology GTAs, which included structured drills of techniques selected to enhance student practice, logic-development, and accountability and reduce apprehension. GTAs received regular performance feedback based on classroom observations. To quantify use of target techniques and levels of student participation, we collected and coded 160 hours of video footage. We found that, although GTAs adopted and utilized many of the target techniques with high frequency, techniques which enforced student participation were not stably adopted and their use was unresponsive to formal feedback. We also found that techniques discussed in training, but not practiced, were not used at quantifiable frequencies, further supporting the importance of practice-based training for influencing instructional practices."
10.1101/116756,Sustaining Scholarly Infrastructures through Collective Action: The lessons that Olson can teach us,"Neylon, C.",Cameron  Neylon,2017-03-14,scientific communication and education,"Infrastructures for data, such as repositories, curation systems, aggregators, indexes and standards are public goods. This means that finding sustainable economic models to support them is a challenge. This is due to free-loading, where someone who does not contribute to the support of the infrastructure nonetheless gains the benefit of it. The work of Mancur Olson (1974) suggests there are only three ways to address this for large groups: compulsion (often as some form of taxation) to support the infrastructure; the provision of non-collective (club) goods limited to those who contribute as a side-effect of providing the collective good; or mechanisms that lower the effective number of participants in the negotiation (oligopoly).\n\nIn this paper I use Olsons framework to analyze existing scholarly infrastructures and proposals for the sustainability of new infrastructures. I argue that the focus on sustainability models prior to seeking a set of agreed governance principles is the wrong approach. Rather we need to understand how to navigate from club-like to public-like goods. We need to define the communities that contribute and identify club-like benefits for those contributors. We need interoperable principles of governance and resourcing to provide public-like goods and we should draw on the political economics of taxation to develop this."

It does not encourage researchers to engage in consistent post-publication changes. Worse yet, post-publication  updates are misconstrued as punishments or admissions of guilt. We propose a different model that publishers of research can apply to the content they publish, ensuring that any post-publication amendments are seamless, transparent and propagated to all the countless places online where descriptions of research appear. At the center, the neutral term \""amendment\"" describes all forms of post-publication change to an article. We lay out a straightforward and consistent process that applies to each of the three types of amendments: insubstantial, substantial, and complete. This proposed system supports the dynamic nature of the research process itself as researchers continue to refine or extend the work, removing the emotive climate particularly associated with retractions and corrections to published work. It allows researchers to cite and share the correct versions of articles with certainty, and for decision makers to have access to the most up to date information."

Further, we demonstrate that this trend is indicative of a growing usage of general scientific jargon. These results are concerning for scientists and for the wider public, as they impact both the reproducibility and accessibility of research findings."

The web service Sci-Hub is amongst the biggest facilitators of this, offering free access to around 62 million publications. So far it is not well studied how and why its users are accessing publications through Sci-Hub. By utilizing the recently released corpus of Sci-Hub and comparing it to the data of {small tilde}28 million downloads done through the service, this study tries to address some of these questions. The comparative analysis shows that both the usage and complete corpus is largely made up of recently published articles, with users disproportionately favoring newer articles and 35% of downloaded articles being published after 2013. These results hint that embargo periods before publications become Open Access are frequently circumnavigated using Guerilla Open Access approaches like Sci-Hub. On a journal level, the downloads show a bias towards some scholarly disciplines, especially Chemistry, suggesting increased barriers to access for these. Comparing the use and corpus on a publisher level, it becomes clear that only 11% of publishers are highly requested in comparison to the baseline frequency, while 45% of all publishers are significantly less accessed than expected. Despite this, the oligopoly of publishers is even more remarkable on the level of content consumption, with 80% of all downloads being published through only 9 publishers. All of this suggests that Sci-Hub is used by different populations and for a number of different reasons, and that there is still a lack of access to the published scientific record. A further analysis of these openly available data resources will undoubtedly be valuable for the investigation of academic publishing."

C.; Casadevall, A.; Bik, E. M.",Daniele  Fanelli,2017-04-12,scientific communication and education,"It is commonly hypothesized that scientists are more likely to engage in data falsification and fabrication when they are subject to pressures to publish, when they are not restrained by forms of social control, when they work in countries lacking policies to tackle scientific misconduct, and when they are male. Evidence to test these hypotheses, however, is inconclusive due to the difficulties of obtaining unbiased data.\n\nHere we report a pre-registered test of these four hypotheses, conducted on papers that were identified in a previous study as containing problematic image duplications through a systematic screening of the journal PLoS ONE. Image duplications were classified into three categories based on their complexity, with category 1 being most likely to reflect unintentional error and category 3 being most likely to reflect intentional fabrication. Multiple parameters connected to the hypotheses above were tested with a matched-control paradigm, by collecting two controls for each paper containing duplications.\n\nCategory 1 duplications were mostly not associated with any of the parameters tested, in accordance with the assumption that these duplications were mostly not due to misconduct. Category 2 and 3, however, exhibited numerous statistically significant associations. Results of univariable and multivariable analyses support the hypotheses that academic culture, peer control, cash-based publication incentives and national misconduct policies might affect scientific integrity. Significant correlations between the risk of image duplication and individual publication rates or gender, however, were only observed in secondary and exploratory analyses.\n\nCountry-level parameters generally exhibited effects of larger magnitude than individual-level parameters, because a subset of countries was significantly more likely to produce problematic image duplications. Promoting good research practices in all countries should be a priority for the international research integrity agenda."

10.1101/133207,"A Universal Metric For Evaluating, Optimising And Benchmarking The Performance Of A Research Technology Platform (RTP)","Petrunkina, A. M.; Filby, A.",Anna M. Petrunkina,2017-05-02,scientific communication and education,"Research Technology Platforms (RTPs) exist to facilitate the application and utilisation of specific analytical technologies to the highest possible standard thus delivering reputable data across a broad spectrum of research themes. Specifically, RTPs centralise expertise in a given technology and provide an unparalleled level of continuity and practical knowledge retention that simply cannot be achieved by more organic, ad hoc means of support. As small non profit businesses often tasked with recovering all or a percentage of their running costs, RTPs are under significant pressure to keep pace with rapidly advancing technology and new methodologies against a back drop of dwindling funding for scientific research. At present there are a number of non-trivial issues that make assessing the operational performance of a RTP difficult to determine on a standalone basis let alone attempting to benchmark against other RTPs within the same or different technology fields. Firstly, depending on the technological speciality the RTP may work to one of essentially three operational models. RTPs such as Bio-Imaging or Cytometry provide access to well-maintained analytical systems that can be utilised by trained individuals for a timed access charge. In some cases there will be a requirement for assisted operation of certain instruments by core staff (e.g. cell sorters). Genomics and Proteomics RTPs tend to function on a project basis whereby users will not access the technology themselves rather pay for a full analytical service often with a milestone-based approach for tracking progress. Other RTPs work to a hybrid approach were technical staff provide certain elements of sample preparation for specific projects prior to analysis on core supported, user accessible instrumentation. Secondly the specific operational costs that each RTP is tasked to recover varies significantly on a local, national and international level due to institutional subsidies. These operational costs can include staff salaries, instrument maintenance, associated running consumables, and in some cases instrument depreciation but there is standardised rule as to what each RTP is tasked to recover and to what percentage.\n\nHere we present a generalised mathematical approach to describe the customisable metrics of any given RTP serviceThe general strategy how to increase performance within the framework of this approach has been identified through breaking down these customisable metrics into components and maximising them according to specific requirements. These strategies could be potentially adopted for different operational or local procedures, integrating the specifics related to the institutional or national policies. The approach laid down here should be considered as a trigger for opening a discussion around how to address optimising RTP performance and allow for benchmarking across the full breadth of RTPs."

The primary outcome compared evidence and justifications in resolving biases by proportions (%) and ORs (Odds Ratio); the secondary outcome determined the proportion (in %) of ME/CFS grants at risk of bias.\n\nResultsNS (cellular study) was twice as likely to present evidence in resolving biases over PACE (psychosocial trial) (OR = 2.16; 65.6% vs 46. 9%), but this difference was not significant (p = 0.13). However, NS was five times more likely to justify biases over PACE (OR = 4.76; 46.9% vs 15. 6%) and this difference was significant (p = 0.0095; p < 0.05). PACE was weak in place (operational aspects 32%) and NS for data practices (37%). The proportion of grants were more biased in PACE (72%) than NS (28%) for evidence, and also more biased in PACE (86%) than NS (14%) for justifications.\n\nConclusionPsychosocial trials on ME/CFS are more likely to engage in selective reporting indicative of research waste than cellular trials. Improvements to place may help reduce these biases, whereas cellular trials may benefit from adopting more translatable data methods. However, these findings are based on two trials. Further risk of bias appraisals are needed to determine the number of trials required to make robust these findings."

Nevertheless, studies of editorial board composition remain rare, especially those focusing on journals publishing research in the increasingly globalized fields of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). Using metrics for quantifying the diversity of ecological communities, we quantified international representation on the 1985-2014 editorial boards of twenty-four environmental biology journals. Over the course of three decades there were 3831 unique scientists based in 70 countries that served as editors. The size of the editorial community increased over time - there were 420% more editors serving in 2014 than in 1985 - as did the number of countries in which editors were based. Nevertheless, editors based outside the  Global North (the group of economically developed countries with high per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) that collectively concentrate most global wealth) were extremely rare. Furthermore, 67.06% of all editors were based in either the USA or UK. Consequently, Geographic Diversity - already low in 1985 - remained unchanged through 2014. We argue that this limited geographic diversity can detrimentally affect the creativity of scholarship published in journals, the progress and direction of research, the composition of the STEM workforce, and the development of science in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, and much of Asia (i.e., the  Global South)."

But this is very difficult to do. I set up a scholarly foraging experiment to try to estimate readership for my own body of work: a personal web site with  reprint pdf files available for downloading and a web statistics program engaged to count these downloads. (I made the site topically rather than author-oriented to increase potential audience size.) Despite this, human users are difficult to count. There are a lot of bots, spiders, and other web programs that increasingly mimic human behavior (e.g., with IP- and chrono-camouflage), and humans own behaviors are changing (e.g., reading papers online many times). From four years of data, after culling both automated activity (a fascinating ecosystem) and humans reading repeatedly online, my papers receive [~]4000-8000 downloads per year, about an order of magnitude higher than the number of citations they receive annually. This is a conservative minimum, because these publications can be obtained from other sources as well. On average, this body of work may be being read at an approximately 10:1 download-to-citation ratio. At a more granular scale, downloads do not correlate with citations; there are some papers being downloaded at about a 100:1 ratio, and it turns out these are exactly how they were meant to be used (e.g., an instruction manual). How intensively someone reads a paper is of course highly variable, but this exercise gives us an idea of how broad our publications impacts actually are. Citations alone dont come close to measuring it."

A.",David Robert  Grimes,2017-05-17,scientific communication and education,"The scientific endeavor pivots on the accurate reporting of experimental and theoretical findings, and consequently scientific publication is immensely important. As the number of active scientists continues to increase, there is concern that rewarding scientists chiefly on publication creates a perverse incentive where careless and fraudulent research can thrive. This is compounded by the predisposition of top-tier journals towards novel or positive findings rather than negative results or investigations that merely confirm a null hypothesis, despite their intrinsic value, potentially compounding a reproducibility crisis in several fields. This is a serious problem for both science and public trust in scientific findings. To date, there has been comparatively little mathematical modeling on the factors that influence science trustworthiness, despite the importance of quantifying the problem. In this work, we present a simple phenomenological model with cohorts of diligent, careless and unethical scientists with funding allocated based on published outputs. The results of this analysis suggest that trustworthiness of published science in a given field is strongly influenced by the false positive rate and the pressures from journals for positive results, and that decreasing available funding has negative consequences for the resulting trustworthiness. We also examine strategies to combat propagation of irreproducible science, including increasing fraud detection and awarding diligence, discussing the implications of these findings."

We propose an easy to apply, fair and universally comparable metric to measure and report co-authors contribution in the scientific literature. The proposed Author Contribution Index (ACI) is based on contribution percentages provided by the authors, preferably at the time of submission. Researchers can use ACI for a number of purposes, including comparing the contributions of different authors, describing the contribution profile of a researcher or analysing how contribution changes through time.

Yet, familiarity with the process of writing a scientific manuscript and receiving peer reviews, often leads to a more focused and driven experimental approach. To jump-start this training, we developed a protocol for teaching manuscript writing and reviewing in the classroom, appropriate for new graduate or upper-level undergraduate students of developmental biology. First, students are provided one of four cartoon data sets, which are focused on genetic models of animal development. Students are instructed to use their creativity to convert evidence into argument, and then to integrate their interpretations into a manuscript, including an illustrated, mechanistic model figure. After student manuscripts are submitted, manuscripts are redacted and distributed to classmates for peer review. Here, we present our cartoon datasets, homework instructions, and grading rubrics as a new resource for the scientific community. We also describe methods for developing new datasets so that instructors can adapt this activity to other disciplines. Our data-driven manuscript writing exercise, as well as the formative and summative assessments resulting from the peer review, enables students to learn fundamental concepts in developmental genetics. In addition, students practice essential skills of scientific communication, including arguing from evidence, developing and testing models, the unique conventions of scientific writing, and the joys of scientific story telling."

In a cohort of over 71,000 unique scientists funded by NIH between 1996 and 2014 we analyzed the association of grant support (as measured by annual GSI) with 3 bibliometric outcomes, maximum Relative Citation Ratio (which arguably reflects a scientists most influential work), median Relative Citation Ratio, and annual weighted Relative Citation Ratio (which is more dependent on publication counts).

The weak evidence provided by P values between 0.01 and 0.05 is explored by exact calculations of false positive rates.\n\nWhen you observe P = 0.05, the odds in favour of there being a real effect (given by the likelihood ratio) are about 3. This is far weaker evidence than the odds of 19 to 1 that might, wrongly, be inferred from the P value. And if you want to limit the false positive rate to 5 percent, you would have to assume that you were 87% sure that there was a real effect before the experiment was done.\n\nIf you observe P = 0.001, which gives likelihood ratio of 100:1 odds on there being a real effect, that would usually be regarded as conclusive, But the false positive rate would still be 8% if the prior probability of a real effect was only 0.1\n\nDespite decades of warnings, many areas of science still insist on labelling a result of P < 0.05 as \""significant\"". This must account for a substantial part of the lack of reproducibility in some areas of science.

This methodology is extensible beyond the history of therapeutics and its use more generally supports (i) efficiency in exploring the scientific history of a research advance (ii) documenting and understanding collaboration (iii) portfolio analysis, planning and optimization (iv) communication of the societal value of research. As a proof of principle, we have conducted a case study of five anti-cancer therapeutics. We have linked the work of roughly 237,000 authors in 106,000 scientific publications that capture the research crucial for the development of these five therapeutics. We have enriched the content of networks of these therapeutics by annotating them with information on research awards as well as peer review that preceded these awards. Applying retrospective citation discovery, we have identified a core set of publications cited in the networks of all five therapeutics and additional intersections in combinations of networks as well as awards from the National Institutes of Health that supported this research. Lastly, we have mapped these awards to their cognate peer review panels, identifying another layer of collaborative scientific activity that influenced the research represented in these networks."

D.",Maxwell  Kramer,2017-06-22,scientific communication and education,"Explicit emphasis on teaching science process skills leads to both gains in the skills themselves and, strikingly, deeper understanding of content. Here, we created and tested a series of online, interactive tutorials with the goal of helping undergraduate students develop science process skills. We designed the tutorials in accordance with evidence-based multimedia design principles and student feedback from usability testing. We then tested the efficacy of the tutorials in an introductory undergraduate biology class. Based on a multivariate ordinary least squares regression model, students that received the tutorials are predicted to score 0.824 points higher on a 15 point science process skill assessment than their peers that received traditional textbook instruction on the same topic. This moderate but significant impact indicates that well designed online tutorials can be more effective than traditional ways of teaching science process skills to undergraduate students. We also found trends that suggest the tutorials are especially effective for non-native English speaking students. However, due to a limited sample size, we were unable to confirm that these trends occurred due to more than just variation in the sampled student group."

While this has provided an increasingly nuanced understanding of brain development, the field is still plagued by inconsistent findings. This review highlights the methodological diversity in existing longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies on structural brain development during childhood and adolescence, and addresses how such variation might contribute to inconsistencies in the literature. We discuss the impact of method choices at multiple decision points across the research process, from study design and sample selection, to image processing and statistical analysis. We also highlight the extent to which different methodological considerations have been empirically examined, drawing attention to specific areas that would benefit from future investigation. Where appropriate, we recommend certain best practices that would be beneficial for the field to adopt, including greater completeness and transparency in reporting methods, in order to ultimately develop an accurate and detailed understanding of normative child and adolescent brain development."

This ambition has been difficult to realize in great part because of the complexity of biodiversity. Theoretical work has led to a complex web of theories, each having non-obvious consequences for other theories. Case in point, the recent realization that genetic diversity involves a great deal of temporal and spatial stochasticity forces theoretical population genetics to consider abiotic and biotic factors generally reserved to ecosystem ecology. This interconnectedness may require theoretical scientists to adopt new techniques adapted to reason about large sets of theories. Mathematicians have solved this problem by using formal languages based on logic to manage theorems. However, theories in ecology and evolution are not mathematical theorems, they involve uncertainty. Recent work in Artificial Intelligence in bridging logic and probability theory offers the opportunity to build rich knowledge bases that combine logics ability to represent complex mathematical ideas with probability theorys ability to model uncertainty. We describe these hybrid languages and explore how they could be used to build a unified knowledge base of theories for ecology and evolution.\n\ncase study you explore using the Salix tritrophic system."

V.; Ellison, A.",Aaron  Ellison,2017-07-18,scientific communication and education,"NSFs Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program supports thousands of undergraduate researchers annually. REU sites operate independently with regards to their research mission and structure, leading to a complex educational milieu distinct from traditional classrooms and labs. Overall, REU sites are perceived as providing highly formative experiences for developing researchers. However, given improved assessment practices over REUs three decades, best practices for student learning and evaluation of long-term impacts remain limited. To address this limitation, we recommend the use of systems-based theoretical frameworks when studying REU programs. We outline how one such framework, cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT), could inform the collection of assessment data. Among other strengths, CHAT guides collection of quantitative and qualitative information that can help characterize REU programs in an educationally meaningful context. Adoption of CHAT and similar approaches by REU Sites could improve dialogue among programs, encourage collaborations, and improve evidence-based practices."

However, the extent to which this gateway ends at Wikipedia or continues via supporting citations is unknown. Wikipedias gateway functionality has implications for information design and education, notably in medicine. This study aims to establish benchmarks for the relative distribution and referral (click) rate of citations--as indicated by presence of a Digital Object Identifier (DOI)--from Wikipedia, with a focus on medical citations.\n\nDOIs referred from the English Wikipedia in August 2016 were obtained from Crossref.org. Next, based on a DOIs presence on a WikiProject Medicine page, all DOIs in Wikipedia were categorized as medical (WP:MED) or non-medical (non-WP:MED). Using this categorization, referred DOIs were classified as WP:MED, non-WP:MED, or BOTH, meaning the DOI may have been referred from either category. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics.\n\nOut of 5.2 million Wikipedia pages, 4.42% (n=229,857) included at least one DOI. 68,870 were identified as WP:MED, with 22.14% (n=15,250) featuring one or more DOIs. WP:MED pages featured on average 8.88 DOI citations per page, whereas non-WP:MED pages had on average 4.28 DOI citations. For DOIs only on WP:MED pages, a DOI was referred every 2,283 pageviews and for non-WP-MED pages every 2,467 pageviews. DOIs from BOTH pages accounted for 12% (n=58,475) of referrals, making determining a referral rate for BOTH impossible.\n\nWhile these results cannot provide evidence of greater citation referral from WP:MED than non-WP:MED, they do provide benchmarks to assess strategies for changing referral patterns. These changes might include editors adopting new methods for designing and presenting citations or the introduction of teaching strategies that address the value of consulting citations as a tool for extending learning."

Monitoring postdoc population trends is important for crafting and evaluating policies that affect this critical population. The tool most use for understanding the trends of the biological sciences postdoc population is the Survey of Graduate Students and Postdoctorates in Science and Engineering (GSS) administered by the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics. To determine how well institutions tracked their postdocs, we analyzed the yearly changes in the biological sciences postdoc population at institutions surveyed by the GSS from 1980 to 2015. We find examples of large changes in the biological sciences postdoc population at one or a few institutions most years from 1980 to 2015. Most universities could not explain the data presented in the GSS, and for those that provided an explanation, the most common causes were improved institutional policies and more robust tracking of their postdocs. These large changes, unrelated to hiring or layoffs, sometimes masked population trends in the broader biological sciences postdoc population. We propose the adoption of a unified definition and titles for postdocs and the creation of an index to better assess biological sciences postdoc population trends.\n\nAbbreviations"

One approach to solve this problem is to replicate previous studies by specialized reproducibility centers. However, this approach is costly or unaffordable and raises a number of yet to be resolved concerns that question its effectiveness and validity. We propose to use an approach that yields a simple numerical measure of veracity, the R-factor, by summarizing the outcomes of already published studies that have attempted to test a claim. The R-factor of an investigator, a journal, or an institution would be the average of the R-factors of the claims they reported. We illustrate this approach using three studies recently tested by a replication initiative, compare the results, and discuss how using the R-factor can help improve the veracity of scientific research."

Piraino,2017-08-22,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundThe detection of fabrication or error within the scientific literature is an important and underappreciated problem. Retraction of scientific articles is rare, but retraction may also be conservative, leaving open the possiblity that many fabricated or erroneous findings remain in the literature as a result of lack of scrutiny. A recently statistical analysis of randomized controlled trials [1] has suggested that the reported statistics form these trials deviate substantially from expectation under truely random assignment, raising the possiblity of fraud or error. It has also been proposed that the method used could be implemented to prospectively screen research, for example by applying the method prior to publication.\n\nMethods and FindingsTo assess the properties of the method proposed in [1], I carry out both theoretical and empirical evaluations of the method. Simulations suggest that the method is sensitive to assumptions that could reasonably be violated in real randomized controlled trials. This suggests that deviation for expectation under this method can not be used to measure the extent of fraud or error within the literature, and raises questions about the utlity of the method for propsective screening. Empirically analysis of the results of the method on a large set of randomized trials suggests that important assumptions may plausibly be violated within this sample. Using retraction as a proxy for fraud or serious error, I show that the method faces serious challenges in terms of precision and sensitivity for the purposes of screening, and that the performance of the method as a screening tool may vary across journals and classes of retractions.\n\nConclusionsThe results in [1] should not be interpreted as indicating large amount of fraud or error within the literature. The use of this method for screening of the literature should be undertaken with great caution, and should recognize critical challenges in interpreting the results of this method."

Genomic findings must be robust and reproducible, and experimental data capture should adhere to FAIR guiding principles. Moreover, effective precision medicine requires standardized reporting that extends beyond wet lab procedures to computational methods. The BioCompute framework (https://osf.io/zm97b/) enables standardized reporting of genomic sequence data provenance, including provenance domain, usability domain, execution domain, verification kit, and error domain. This framework facilitates communication and promotes interoperability. Bioinformatics computation instances that employ the BioCompute framework are easily relayed, repeated if needed and compared by scientists, regulators, test developers, and clinicians. Easing the burden of performing the aforementioned tasks greatly extends the range of practical application. Large clinical trials, precision medicine, and regulatory submissions require a set of agreed upon standards that ensures efficient communication and documentation of genomic analyses. The BioCompute paradigm and the resulting BioCompute Objects (BCO) offer that standard, and are freely accessible as a GitHub organization (https://github.com/biocompute-objects) following the \""Open-Stand.org principles for collaborative open standards development\"". By communication of high-throughput sequencing studies using a BCO, regulatory agencies (e.g., FDA), diagnostic test developers, researchers, and clinicians can expand collaboration to drive innovation in precision medicine, potentially decreasing the time and cost associated with next generation sequencing workflow exchange, reporting, and regulatory reviews."

The report cited the disparity between the diversity among the general public versus that of the STEM professional community and recommended measures to ensure that the women and members of underrepresented racial groups, who together comprise 70% of college graduates but only 45% of college STEM graduates, would become better represented in those fields. This call for action echoed calls by the National Academy of Sciences to expand underrepresented minority participation in STEM at the college level (NAS, 2011). In the following study, we examined whether participation in the Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL) model in introductory biology influenced the rates of recruitment into STEM and retention in STEM for underrepresented minority (URM) students and for non-URM students. Chi-square analyses reveal that there are significant gaps in STEM recruitment and retention rates between URM and non-URM students, but when these students participate in the PLTL model, no differences in STEM recruitment or retention rates were observed. Additionally, we found that STEM retention rates were significantly improved for URM students who engaged in PLTL."

However, bioinformatics instruction is rarely integrated into life sciences curricula at the undergraduate level. To understand why, the Network for Integrating Bioinformatics into Life Sciences Education (NIBLSE, \""nibbles\"") recently undertook an extensive survey of life sciences faculty in the United States. The survey responses to open-ended questions about barriers to integration were subjected to keyword analysis. The barrier most frequently reported by the ~1,260 respondents was lack of faculty training. Faculty at associates-granting institutions report the least training in bioinformatics and the least integration of bioinformatics into their teaching. Faculty from underrepresented minority groups (URMs) in STEM reported training barriers at a higher rate than others, although the number of URM respondents was small. Interestingly, the cohort of faculty with the most recently awarded PhD degrees reported the most training but were teaching bioinformatics at a lower rate than faculty who earned their degrees in previous decades. Other barriers reported included lack of student interest in bioinformatics; lack of student preparation in mathematics, statistics, and computer science; already overly full curricula; and limited access to resources, including hardware, software, and vetted teaching materials. The results of the survey, the largest to date on bioinformatics education, will guide efforts to further integrate bioinformatics instruction into undergraduate life sciences education."

Indeed, recent replication attempts have revealed low levels of replicability, pointing to high rates of false-positives in the literature5-10. A contemporary solution to this problem is pre-registration: commitment to aspects of methods and analysis before data acquisition11. This solution is valid only to the extent that the commitment stage is time-locked to precede data collection. To date, time-locking can only be guaranteed by introducing a third party such as peer reviewers at an early stage, making this solution less appealing for many12. Here we adapt a cryptographic method13 to encode information of study protocol within random aspects of the data acquisition process. This way, the structure of variability in the data time-locks the commitment stage with respect to data acquisition. Being independent of any third party, this method fully preserves scientific autonomy and confidentiality. We provide code for easy implementation and a detailed example from the field of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)."

This problem is frequently faced when assessing whether a cell synchronization experiment was successful or not. In this case the goal is to determine whether the DNA content is best represented by a unimodal, indicating successful synchronization, or bimodal, indicating unsuccessful synchronization, distribution. This choice of bin size can greatly affect the interpretation of the results; however, it can be avoided by fitting the data to a cumulative distribution function (CDF). Fitting data to a CDF removes the need for bin size selection. The sorted data can also be used to reconstruct an approximate probability density function (PDF) without selecting a bin size. A simple CDF-based approach is presented and the benefits and drawbacks relative to usual methods are discussed."

The results of this survey showed that the greatest exposure to NCD was in clinical practice, followed by teaching NCD content, and then research. Few researchers published their findings in journals. All responders reported needing significant support in research design, methods and statistical analysis procedures. These results were used to guide the development of a post-doctoral training program for NCD research in Thailand. After three years of the training program, we found that trainee applicants preferences and choices were aligned with the original survey-based planning."

O.; Hendricks, M.; Straus, S.; Tannenbaum, C.",Holly O Witteman,2017-12-12,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundPrevious research shows that men often receive more research funding than women, but does not provide empirical evidence as to why this occurs. In 2014, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) created a natural experiment by dividing all investigator-initiated funding into two new grant programs: one with and one without an explicit review focus on the caliber of the principal investigator.\n\nMethodsWe analyzed application success among 23,918 grant applications from 7,093 unique principal investigators in a 5-year natural experiment across all investigator-initiated CIHR grant programs in 2011-2016. We used Generalized Estimating Equations to account for multiple applications by the same applicant and an interaction term between each principal investigators self-reported sex and grant programs to compare success rates between male and female applicants under different review criteria.\n\nResultsThe overall grant success rate across all competitions was 15.8%. After adjusting for age and research domain, the predicted probability of funding success in traditional programs was 0.9 percentage points higher for male than for female principal investigators (OR 0.934, 95% CI 0.854-1.022). In the new program focused on the proposed science, the gap was 0.9 percentage points in favour of male principal investigators (OR 0.998, 95% CI 0.794-1.229). In the new program with an explicit review focus on the caliber of the principal investigator, the gap was 4.0 percentage points in favour of male principal investigators (OR 0.705, 95% CI 0.519- 0.960).\n\nInterpretationThis study suggests gender gaps in grant funding are attributable to less favourable assessments of women as principal investigators, not differences in assessments of the quality of science led by women. We propose ways for funders to avoid allowing gender bias to influence research funding.\n\nFundingThis study was unfunded."

Then, clinical data elements in the models were pulled from clinical data and transformed to the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model; genetic data elements were added based on population rates. A hybrid Bayesian network was used to create synthetic data from the logical elements of the risk scores and the underlying population frequencies of the clinical data.\n\nResultsA synthetic dataset of 446,000 patients was created. A two-day curriculum was created based on this synthetic data with exploratory data analysis and machine learning components. The curriculum was offered on two separate occasions; the two groups of learners were given the curriculum and data, and results were tallied, summarized, and compared. Students ability to complete the challenge was mixed; more experienced students achieved a range of 70%-85% in balanced accuracy, but many others did not perform better than the baseline model.\n\nDiscussionOverall, students enjoyed the course and dataset, but some struggled to consistently apply machine learning techniques. The curriculum, data set, techniques for generation, and results are available for others to use for their own training.\n\nConclusionA realistic synthetic data with clinical and genetic components helps students learn issues in cardiovascular risk scoring, practice data science skills, and compete in a challenge to improve identification of risk."

A.; Casadevall, A.",Nichole A Broderick,2017-12-31,scientific communication and education,"In recent decades, the biomedical literature has witnessed an increasing number of authors per article together with a concomitant increase of authors claiming to have contributed equally. In this study, we analyzed over 3000 publications from 1995-2017 claiming equal contributions for authors sharing the first author position for author number, gender, and gender position. The frequency of dual pairings contributing equally was male-male > mixed gender > female-female. For mixed gender pairs males were more often at the first position although the disparity has lessened in the past decade. Among author associations claiming equal contribution and containing three or more individuals, males predominated in both the first position and number of gender exclusive groupings. Our results show a disequilibrium in gender ratios among authors who contributed equally from expected ratios had the ordering been done randomly or alphabetical. Given the importance of the first author position in assigning credit for a publication, the finding of fewer than expected females in associations involving shared contributions raises concerns about women not receiving their fair share of expected credit. The results suggest a need for journals to request clarity on the method used to decide author order among individuals claiming to have made equal contributions to a scientific publication."
10.1101/246264,Edge Factors: Scientific Frontier Positions of Nations,"Packalen, M.",Mikko  Packalen,2018-01-10,scientific communication and education,"A key decision in scientific work is whether to build on novel or well-established ideas. Because exploiting new ideas is often harder than more conventional science, novel work can be especially dependent on interactions with colleagues, the training environment, and ready access to potential collaborators. Location may thus influence the tendency to pursue work that is close to the edge of the scientific frontier in the sense that it builds on recent ideas. We calculate for each nation its position relative to the edge of the scientific frontier by measuring its propensity to build on relatively new ideas in biomedical research. Text analysis of 20+ million publications shows that the United States and South Korea have the highest tendencies for novel science. China has become a leader in favoring newer ideas when working with basic science ideas and research tools, but is still slow to adopt new clinical ideas. Many locations remain far behind the leaders in terms of their tendency to work with novel ideas, indicating that the world is far from flat in this regard."

J.; Shadmehr, R.",Reza  Shadmehr,2018-01-16,scientific communication and education,"A recent policy change at Journal of Neuroscience (JN) has significantly increased editorial \""desk rejections\"", reducing the number of papers that are considered for publication. Survey results from 130 scientists suggested that the new policy may have had a particularly large impact on studies that focused on human behavioral techniques. To quantify the effects of the new policy, we gathered data on all papers ever published in JN (~35,000), as well as all papers that had cited the JN papers (~2.7 million papers). We found that the recent change in editorial policy had disproportionately affected rejection rates of human behavioral papers: since 2015, the number of human behavioral papers as a proportion of all papers published in JN has seen a 30% decline. While there has been a long-term declining trend in the journals impact factor, we found that this declining impact factor was shared by both human behavioral papers as well as other papers in the journal. This suggested that whatever may have been the source of the declining impact factor at JN, this source was affecting the various areas of research equally. That is, it was unlikely that papers in any one field were responsible for the declining impact factor number at JN. Indeed, when impact was measured over the long-term, we found that the average human behavioral paper at JN consistently outperformed other papers, generating a significantly higher number of citations per year at 5 and 10 years post publication."

Community-developed standards, such as those for the identification1 and reporting2 of data, underpin reproducible and reusable research, aid scholarly publishing, and drive both the discovery and evolution of scientific practice. The number of these standardization efforts, driven by large organizations or at the grass root level, has been on the rise since the early 2000s. Thousands of community-developed standards are available (across all disciplines), many of which have been created and/or implemented by several thousand data repositories. Nevertheless, their uptake by the research community, however, has been slow and uneven. This is mainly because investigators lack incentives to follow and adopt standards. The situation is exacerbated if standards are not promptly implemented by databases, repositories and other research tools, or endorsed by infrastructures. Furthermore, the fragmentation of community efforts results in the development of arbitrarily different, incompatible standards. In turn, this leads to standards becoming rapidly obsolete in fast-evolving research areas.\n\nAs with any other digital object, standards, databases and repositories are dynamic in nature, with a  life cycle that encompasses formulation, development and maintenance; their status in this cycle may vary depending on the level of activity of the developing group or community. There is an urgent need for a service that enhances the information available on the evolving constellation of heterogeneous standards, databases and repositories, guides users in the selection of these resources, and that works with developers and maintainers of these resources to foster collaboration and promote harmonization. Such an informative and educational service is vital to reduce the knowledge gap among those involved in producing, managing, serving, curating, preserving, publishing or regulating data. A diverse set of stakeholders-representing academia, industry, funding agencies, standards organizations, infrastructure providers and scholarly publishers-- both national and domain-specific as well global and general organizations-- have come together as a community, representing the core adopters, advisory board members, and/or key collaborators of the FAIRsharing resource. Here, we introduce its mission and community network. We present an evaluation of the standards landscape, focusing on those for reporting data and metadata - the most diverse and numerous of the standards - and their implementation by databases and repositories. We report on the ongoing challenge to recommend resources, and we discuss the importance of making standards invisible to the end users.

We set out to clarify the open access variants provided by leading medical journals for research in general and industry-funded research in particular, and record the availability of the CC BY licence for commercially funded research.\n\nMethodsWe identified medical journals with a 2015 impact factor of at least 15.0 on 24 May 2017, then excluded from the analysis journals that only publish review articles. Between 29 June 2017 and 26 July 2017, we collected information about each journals open access policies from their websites and/or by email contact. We contacted the journals by email again between 6 December 2017 and 2 January 2018 to confirm our findings.\n\nResultsThirty-five medical journals publishing original research from 13 publishers were included in the analysis. All 35 journals offered some form of open access with varying embargo periods of up to 12 months. Of these journals, 21 (60%) provided immediate open access with a CC BY licence under certain circumstances (e.g. to specific research funders). Of these 21, 20 only offered a CC BY licence to authors funded by non-commercial organizations and one offered this option to funders who required it.\n\nConclusionsMost leading medical journals do not offer to authors reporting commercially funded research an open access licence that allows unrestricted sharing and adaptation of the published material. The journals policies are therefore not aligned with open access declarations and guidelines. Commercial research funders lag behind academic funders in the development of mandatory open access policies, and it is time for them to work with publishers to advance the dissemination of the research they fund.\n\nStrengths and limitations of this studyO_LIThis manuscript includes a systematic analysis of open access policies of journals with a high impact factor, including society-owned journals, from multiple publishers.\nC_LIO_LIThe open access policies of all journals analysed were clarified, and confirmation of our findings was received by email from 97% of the contacted journals.\nC_LIO_LIOpen access policies of the journals and publishers analysed are subject to change, so the information presented here may not be current.\nC_LIO_LIBy selecting journals with a high impact factor, our analysis does not include prestigious journals from specialized therapy areas and regional or non-English language journals, which may have lower impact factors.\nC_LIO_LIAlthough our study covers only a small number of journals, extending such a manual analysis to a greater number of journals without loss of detail and verification of all results would be cumbersome and inefficient by relying on traditional analysis tools.\nC_LI"

L.; Toure, V.; Wipat, A.; Wolkenhauer, O.; Waltemath, D.",Maxwell L Neal,2018-01-23,scientific communication and education,"Life science researchers use computational models to articulate and test hypotheses about the behavior of biological systems. Semantic annotation is a critical component for enhancing the interoperability and reusability of such models as well as for the integration of the data needed for model parameterization and validation. Encoded as machine-readable links to knowledge resource terms, semantic annotations describe the computational or biological meaning of what models and data represent. These annotations help researchers find and repurpose models, accelerate model composition, and enable knowledge integration across model repositories and experimental data stores. However, realizing the potential benefits of semantic annotation requires the development of model annotation standards that adhere to a community-based annotation protocol. Without such standards, tool developers must account for a variety of annotation formats and approaches, a situation that can become prohibitively cumbersome and which can defeat the purpose of linking model elements to controlled knowledge resource terms. Currently, no consensus protocol for semantic annotation exists among the larger biological modeling community. Here, we report on the landscape of current semantic annotation practices among the COmputational Modeling in BIology NEtwork (COMBINE) community and provide a set of recommendations for building a consensus approach to semantic annotation."

Whereas scientific misconduct, like data fabrication, is clearly irresponsible and unethical, other behaviors--often referred to as questionable research practices (QRPs)--exploit the ethical shades of gray that color acceptable practice. This study aimed to measure the frequency of self-reported QRPs in a diverse, international sample of health professions education (HPE) researchers.\n\nMethodIn 2017, the authors conducted an anonymous, cross-sectional survey study. The web-based survey contained 43 QRP items that asked respondents to rate how often they had engaged in various forms of scientific misconduct. The items were adapted from two previously published surveys.\n\nResultsIn total, 590 HPE researchers took the survey. The mean age was 46 years (SD=11.6), and the majority of participants were from the United States (26.4%), Europe (23.2%), and Canada (15.3%). The three most frequently reported QRPs were adding authors to a paper who did not qualify for authorship (60.6%), citing articles that were not read (49.5%), and selectively citing papers to please editors or reviewers (49.4%). Additionally, respondents reported misrepresenting a participants words (6.7%), plagiarizing (5.5%), inappropriately modifying results (5.3%), deleting data without disclosure (3.4%), and fabricating data (2.4%). Overall, 533 (90.3%) respondents reported at least one QRP.\n\nConclusionsNotwithstanding the methodological limitations of survey research, these findings indicate that a substantial proportion of HPE researchers report a range of QRPs. In light of these results, reforms are needed to improve the credibility and integrity of the HPE research enterprise.\n\nO_QD\""Researchers should practice research responsibly.

Despite much progress, however, a number of problems remain including slow integration of new statistical or methodological approaches into user-friendly software, low prevalence of open-source software, and poor integration among distinct software tools. These issues hinder the utility and transparency of new methods to the research community. Here I present revtools, an R package to support article screening during evidence synthesis projects. It provides tools for the import and de-duplication of bibliographic data, screening of articles by title or abstract, and visualization of article content using topic models. The software is entirely open-source and combines command-line scripting for experienced programmers with custom-built user interfaces for casual users, with further methods to support article screening to be added over time. Revtools provides free access to novel methods in an open-source environment, and represents a valuable step in expanding the capacity of R to support evidence synthesis projects."

R.",Lauren A Maggio,2018-02-13,scientific communication and education,"Researchers, funders, and institutions are interested in understanding and quantifying research dissemination and impact, particularly related to communicating with the public. Traditionally, citations have been a primary impact measure; however, citations can be slow to accrue and focus on academic use. Recently altmetrics, which track alternate dissemination forms (e.g., social media) have been suggested as a complement to citation-based metrics. This study examines the relationship between altmetrics and traditional measures: journal article citations and access counts.\n\nThe researchers queried Web of Science and Altmetric Explorer for articles published in HPE journals between 2013-2015. They identified 2,486 articles with altmetrics. Data were analyzed using negative binomial and linear regression models.\n\nBlogging was associated with the greatest increase in citations (13% increase), whereas Tweets (1.2%) and Mendeley (1%) were associated with smaller increases. Journal impact factor (JIF) was associated with a 21% increase in citations. Publicly accessible articles were associated with a 19% decrease, but the interactive effect between accessible articles and JIF was associated with a 12% increase. When examining access counts, publicly accessible articles had an increase of 170 access counts whereas blogging was associated with a decrease of 87 accesses.\n\nThis study suggests that several altmetrics outlets are positively associated with citations, and that public accessibility, holding all other independent variables constant, is positively related to article access. Given the scientific communitys evolving focus on dissemination--including to the public--these findings have implications for stakeholders, providing insight into the factors that may improve citations and access of articles."

M.; Galland, M.",Marc  Galland,2018-02-15,scientific communication and education,"For most experimental biologists, handling the avalanche of data generated is similar to learning how to drive on your own. Although that might be doable, it is preferable and safer to learn programming and good practices together and preferably from experienced scientists. One way to achieve this is to build local communities of practice in scientific programming by bringing together life scientists that perform code-intensive research to spread know-how and good practices. The community will make sure that, for a given researcher working for an academic institution, their capacity to conduct data-intensive research will not be arbitrarily reliant on the presence of well-trained bioinformaticians in their vicinity.\n\nIn this paper, we propose a three-step field guide for building a local community of practice in scientific programming for life scientists. The first step is organizing a Carpentries programming workshop designed for researchers new to computational biology. However, while such workshops provide an immediate solution for learning, more regular long-term assistance is also needed. Researchers need persisting, local support to continue learning and solving programming issues that may hamper their research progress. The solution we describe here is to implement a Mozilla Study Group where researchers can meet-up and help each other in a \""safe-learning atmosphere\"". We describe two real-life examples of building local communities of practice: one in the Netherlands at the Amsterdam Science Park and one in the United States at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. In order to help future researchers to build their own community of practice in scientific programming we discuss challenges and implemented solutions.\n\nWe believe that our local communities of practice will prove useful for other life scien-tists who want to set up similar support groups for researchers involved in scientific programming and data science.\n\nAuthor summaryIn this paper, we describe why and how to build a community of practice for life scientists that start to make more use of computers and programming in their research. A community of practice is a small group of scientists that meet regularly to help each other and promote good practices in scientific computing. While most life scientists are well-trained in the laboratory to conduct experiments, good practices with (big) datasets and their analysis are often missing. This paper proposes a field-guide on how to build such a community of practice at a local academic institution. Based on two real-life examples, challenges and related recommendations are provided. We believe that the current data deluge that life scientists will increasingly face can benefit from the implementation of these small communities. Good practices spread among experimental scientists will foster open, transparent, sound scientific results beneficial to society."

In a regression analysis, it was found that the most important factors that influences how long a presenter spoke was 1) their allocated time, 2) their career stage and 3) the level of time keeping enforcement. It was also found that gender and the size of the conference contributed significantly towards the speakers timing. Male speakers exceeded their allocated time more frequently than female speakers, especially at large conferences (60% vs 49%). Since conferences are an important arena for science dissemination this might have a negative impact on female scientists careers."

To understand such reuse, automatically detecting it would be important. Here we present an analysis of figure element reuse on a large dataset comprising 760 thousand open access articles and 2 million figures. Our algorithm detects figure region reuse, while being robust to rotation, cropping, resizing, and contrast changes, and estimates which of the reuses have biological meaning. Then a three-person panel analyzes how problematic these biological reuses are using contextual information such as captions and full texts. Based on the panel reviews, we estimate that 9% of the biological reuses would be unanimously perceived as at least suspicious. We further estimate that 0.6% of all articles would be unanimously perceived as fraudulent, with inappropriate reuses occurring 43% across articles, 28% within article, and 29% within a figure. Our tool rapidly detects image reuse at scale, promising to be useful to a broad range of people that campaign for scientific integrity. We suggest that a great deal of scientific fraud will be, sooner or later, detectable by automatic methods."

Previous research has found that, unsurprisingly, successful mentors tend to train successful students. But what characteristics of this relationship predict success, and how? We analyzed an open-access database of about 20,000 researchers who have undergone both graduate and postdoctoral training, compiled across several fields of biomedical science. Our results show that postdoctoral mentors were more instrumental to trainees success compared to graduate mentors. A trainees success in academia was predicted by the degree of intellectual synthesis with their mentors, resulting from fusing the influence of disparate advisors. This suggests that junior scientists should have increased chances of success by training with and linking the ideas of mentors from different fields. We discuss the implications of these results for choosing mentors and determining the duration of postdoctoral training."

We collected research article publication records from 15 high-profile multidisciplinary and neuroscience journals for 2005-2017 and analyzed the representation of women over time, as well as its relationship with journal impact factor. We find that women authors have been persistently underrepresented in high-profile journals. This under-representation has persisted over more than a decade, with glacial improvement over time. Even within our limited group of high profile journals, the percent of female first and last authors is negatively associated with journal impact factor. Since publishing in high-profile journals is a gateway to academic success, this underrepresentation of women may contribute to the lack of women at the top of the academic ladder."

M.",Alice M Lee,2018-03-03,scientific communication and education,"AbstractStudents positive perceptions of the learning environment increase retention and persistence in STEM disciplines. This study presents results from a Learning Environment Questionnaire administered at the beginning and end of the semester in a redesigned general/introductory microbiology course offered in traditional lecture, flipped and online sections. Split-sample t-tests and chi-squared tests were used for cross-section and within section analyses, respectively. The findings support the study hypothesis that student perceptions of the learning environment will vary as a function of platform. This work demonstrates the additional effect of the time in the semester when students complete the questionnaire and this effect on students perceptions over the course of the semester relative to their initial perceptions. The results of this study offer insight on student perceptions of the learning environment as universities embrace online education in introductory and gateway courses as a response to rising student enrollments and diminishing resources."

Although research in the field has rapidly grown in recent years, one of the main challenges facing researchers remains to be the complexity and messiness of the data. Therefore, it is imperative to provide tools that pave the way for more research on the new subject of MOOCs. This paper introduces a package called crsra based on the statistical software R to help clean and analyze massive loads of data provided by Coursera. The advantages of the package are as follows: a) faster loading and organizing data for analysis, b) an efficient method for combining data from multiple courses and even across institutions, and c) provision of a set of functions for analyzing student behaviors."

R.",Jing  Liao,2018-03-12,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundThe amount of published in vivo studies and the speed researchers are publishing them make it virtually impossible to follow the recent development in the field. Systematic review emerged as a method to summarise and analyse the studies quantitatively and critically but it is often out-of-date due to its lengthy process.

MethodWe invited five machine learning and text-mining groups to build classifiers for identifying publications relevant to neuropathic pain (33814 training publications). We kept 1188 publications for the assessment of the performance of different classifiers. Two groups participated in the next stage: testing their algorithm on datasets labeled for psychosis (11777/2944) and datasets labeled for Vitamin D in multiple sclerosis (train/text: 2038/510).

ResultThe performances (sensitive/specificity) of the most promising classifier built for neuropathic pain are: 95%/84%. The performance for psychosis and Vitamin D in multiple sclerosis datasets are 95%/73% and 100%/45%.

ConclusionsMachine learning can significantly reduce the irrelevant publications in a systematic review, and save the scientists time and money. Classifier algorithms built for one dataset can be reapplied on another dataset in different field. We are building a machine learning service at the back of Systematic Review & Meta-analysis Facility (SyRF)."

D. P.; Wiles, J. R.",Ryan D.P. Dunk,2018-03-13,scientific communication and education,"Recent research has identified many factors influencing student acceptance of biological evolution, but few of these factors have been measured in a longitudinal context of changing knowledge and acceptance of evolution over a period of instruction. This study investigates factors previously associated with evolution acceptance as well as other potential factors among students over the course of a year-long majors and non-majors introductory biology sequence at a private, research-intensive university in the northeastern United States. Acceptance of evolution was measured using the Measure of Acceptance of the Theory of Evolution (MATE) instrument, and other factors were measured using well-established instruments and a demographic survey. As expected given the context, evolution was widely accepted among the population (71% of our sample scored in the \""high\"" or \""very high\"" acceptance range), but 160 students were in the very low to moderate acceptance range. Over the course of the academic year, regressions on measures of normalized change revealed that as knowledge of the Nature of Science (NOS) increased, evolution acceptance increased (R2 = .378, p << 0.001). Increasing levels of genetic literacy (R2 = .214, p << 0.001) and Evolutionary Knowledge (R2 = .177, p << 0.001) were also significantly associated with increases in acceptance of evolution. We also examined the longitudinal effect of combining various factors into unified working models of acceptance of evolution, and this is the first study by our knowledge to do so. From fall to spring, the influence of student knowledge of NOS on evolution acceptance increased, as did the influence of genetic literacy. Conversely, the influence of religious variables decreased, as did the influence of political inclinations and race/ethnicity. Our results indicate that as students learn more about the nature of science, they may rely more on scientific explanations for natural phenomena. This study also underscores the importance of using longitudinal, multifactorial analyses to understand acceptance of evolution."

However, most seemingly \""open data\"" do not provide legal permissions for reuse and redistribution. Not being able to integrate and redistribute our collective data resources blocks innovation, and stymies the creation of life-improving diagnostic and drug selection tools. To help the biomedical research and research support communities (e.g. libraries, funders, repositories, etc.) understand and navigate the data licensing landscape, the (Re)usable Data Project (RDP) (http://reusabledata.org) assesses the licensing characteristics of data resources and how licensing behaviors impact reuse. We have created a ruleset to determine the reusability of data resources and have applied it to 56 scientific data resources (i.e. databases) to date. The results show significant reuse and interoperability barriers. Inspired by game-changing projects like Creative Commons, the Wikipedia Foundation, and the Free Software movement, we hope to engage the scientific community in the discussion regarding the legal use and reuse of scientific data, including the balance of openness and how to create sustainable data resources in an increasingly competitive environment."

However, when ZIKV emerged in Brazil 2015 the attention increased rapidly. The announcement by Brazilian authorities, that ZIKV infection was associated with severe congenital disease e.g. microcephaly, surged public interest. Because of the accumulation of evidence that showed the magnitude of the ZIKV outbreak in the Americas, the World Health Organization declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern February 1, 2016.\n\nResultsDuring 2015-2017, we witnessed one of the most active and cooperated research responses against an emerging disease. To investigate the impact of ZIKV research during those years we decided to perform a bibliometric analysis of ZIKV research. The search for research articles on ZIKV was performed by bibliometric analysis from the scientific databases PubMed and Scopus. We found that the number of ZIKV related publications increased 38-41 times in 2016-2017 compared to 2015. During the three years there was a temporal shift in ZIKV research trends, from reports of ZIKV case studies and diagnostic methods, to development of ZIKV prevention and treatment. In addition, the number of countries involved in ZIKV research increased from 25 in 2015 to 111 in 2016 and 139 in the following year, showing that ZIKV research became global during three years.\n\nConclusionsThe results from our study highlighted the importance of gathering public interest to global health issues, and how it can act as a powerful catalyzer to trigger the research field. However, despite the progress in ZIKV research, many questions remain to be addressed to accelerate the development of effective ZIKV countermeasures. Nevertheless, as long as we remember the importance of support and collaboration that we have experienced during the multidisciplinary effort against the current ZIKV outbreak, we will have an idea on how to handle the next inevitable and yet unknown infectious disease threat."

E.",Lewis E MacKenzie,2018-04-11,scientific communication and education,"1.Since 2004, podcasts have emerged as a decentralised medium for science communication to the global public. However, to-date, there have been no large-scale quantitative studies of the production and dissemination of science podcasts. This study identified 952 English language science podcasts available between January and February 2018 and analysed online textual and visual data related to the podcasts and classified and noted key production parameters. It was found that the total number of science podcast series available grew linearly between 2004 and 2010, and then exponentially between 2010 and 2018. 65% of science podcast series were hosted by scientists and 77% were targeted to public audiences. Although a wide range of primarily single-subject science podcasts series were noted, 34% of science podcast series were not dedicated to a science subject. Compared to biology and physics, chemistry may be under-represented by science podcasts. Only 24% of science podcast series had any overt financial income. 62% of science podcast series were affiliated to an organisation; producing a greater number of episodes (median = 24, average = 96) than independent science podcast series (median = 16, average = 48). This study provides the first  snapshot of how science podcasts are being used to communicate science to public audiences around the globe."

R.; Westgate, M.",Neal R Haddaway,2018-04-20,scientific communication and education,"Systematic reviews aim to maximise transparency and comprehensiveness, whilst also minimising subjectivity and sources of bias. Because of these time-consuming and complex tasks, systematic reviews are perceived as being resource-intensive. To date, published estimates of systematic review resource requirements have been largely anecdotal, being imprecise and not based on evidence. However, it is valuable to provide reliable means of estimating the resource and time requirements of systematic reviews and maps. We analysed all CEE systematic reviews (n=66) and maps (n=20) published or registered between 2012 and 2017 to estimate the average time needed to complete a systematic review and map. We then surveyed 33 experienced systematic reviewers to collate information on time needed for each stage of the review process. Our results show that the average CEE systematic review takes 157 days (SD; {+/-}22), whilst the average CEE systematic map takes 209 days (SD; {+/-}53). While screening of titles and abstracts is widely accepted to be time-consuming, in practice meta-data extraction and critical appraisal can take as long (or even longer) to complete, especially when producing systematic maps. Finally, we present a tool that allows the user to predict the time requirements of a review or map given information known about the planned methods and evidence base likely to be identified. Our tool uses evidence-based defaults as a useful starting point for those wishing to predict the time requirements for a particular review. Our analyses shed light on the most time-consuming stages of the systematic review and map process, and highlight key bottlenecks from the perspective of time requirements, helping future reviewers to plan their time accordingly. Future predictions of effort required to complete systematic reviews and maps could be improved if CEE and CEE review authors provided more detailed reporting of the methods and results of their reviewing processes."
10.1101/304766,Aligning interests: Integrating Citizen Science Efforts into Schools Through Service Requirements.,"Tsueng, G.; Kumar, A.; Nanis, M.; Su, A. I.",Ginger  Tsueng,2018-04-21,scientific communication and education,"Citizen science is an increasingly valuable tool for both scientists and educators. For researchers, citizen science is a means of more quickly investigating questions which would otherwise be time-consuming and costly to study. For educators, citizen science offers a means to engage students in actual research and improve learning outcomes. Since most citizen science projects are usually designed with research goals in mind, many lack the necessary educator materials for successful integration in a formal science education (FSE) setting. In an ideal world, researchers and educators would build the necessary materials together; however, many researchers lack the time, resources, and networks to create these materials early on in the life of a citizen science project. For resource-poor projects, we propose an intermediate entry point for recruiting from the educational setting: community service or service learning requirements (CSSLRs). Many schools require students to participate in community service or service learning activities in order to graduate. When implemented well, CSSLRs provide students with growth and development opportunities outside the classroom while contributing to the community and other worthwhile causes. However, CSSLRs take time, resources, and effort to implement well. Just as citizen science projects need to establish relationships to transition well into formal science education, schools need to cultivate relationships with community service organizations. Students and educators at schools with CSSLRs where implementation is still a work in progress may be left with a burdensome requirement and inadequate support. With the help of a volunteer fulfilling a CSSLR, we investigated the number of students impacted by CSSLRs set at different levels of government and explored the qualifications needed for citizen science projects to fulfill CSSLRs by examining the explicitly-stated justifications for having CSSLRs, surveying how CSSLRs are verified, and using these qualifications to demonstrate how an online citizen science project, Mark2Cure, could use this information to meet the needs of students fulfilling CSSLRs."

The purpose of this commentary is to direct attention a common fallacy that can be observed in paper reviews and professional exchanges in the field of Psychology and Neuroscience pertaining to multiple regression analysis. The fallacy concerns the confusion of the requirements on the residuals of a linear-regression model with requirements on the dependent or independent variables themselves. A simple thought experiment, algebraic demonstration, and simulation study can demonstrate this misconception. It is our hope that consideration of the fallacy may help clarify distinctions between technical statistical issues and conceptual interpretation of research findings."

This is often achieved by the standard simulation design S0 under the so-called  theoretical null of no association. In practice, whole-genome association analyses scan through a large number of genetic markers (Gs) for the ones associated with an outcome of interest (Y), where Y comes from an unknown alternative while the majority of Gs are not associated with Y, that is under the  empirical null. This reality can be better represented by two other simulation designs, where design S1.1 simulates Y from an alternative model based on G then evaluates its association with independently generated Gnew, while design S1.2 evaluates the association between permutated Yperm and G. More than a decade ago, Efron (2004) has noted the important distinction between the  theoretical and  empirical null in false discovery rate control. Using scale tests for variance heterogeneity and location tests of interaction effect as two examples, here we show that not all null simulation designs are equal. In examining the accuracy of a likelihood ratio test, while simulation design S0 shows the method has the correct T1E control, designs S1.1 and S1.2 suggest otherwise with empirical T1E values of 0.07 for the 0.05 nominal level. And the inflation becomes more severe at the tail and does not diminish as sample size increases. This is an important observation that calls for new practices for methods evaluation and interpretation of T1E control."

M.",Silvia  Ceausu,2018-04-30,scientific communication and education,"Unbiased scientific reporting is crucial for data and research synthesis. Previous studies suggest that statistically significant results are more likely to be published and more likely to be submitted to high impact journals. However, the most recent research on statistical significance in relation to journal impact factors in ecological research was published more than two decades ago or addressed a small subset of the literature. Here, we extract p-values from all articles published in 11 journals in 2012 and 2014 across a wide range of impact factors with six journals sampled in both years. Our results indicate that the proportion of statistically significant results increases with rising impact factor. Such a trend can have important consequences for syntheses of ecological data and it highlights the importance of covering a wide range of impact factors when identifying published studies for data syntheses. This trend can also lead to a biased understanding of the probability of true effects in ecology and conservation. We caution against the possible downplaying of non-significant results by either journals or authors."

To discourage coercive authorship practices and inflated publication records, journals require authors to affirm and detail their intellectual contributions but this strategy has been unsuccessful as authorship lists continue to grow. Here, we surveyed close to 6000 of the top cited authors in all science categories with a list of 25 research activities that we adapted from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) authorship guidelines. Responses varied widely from individuals in the same discipline, same level of experience, and the same geographic region. Most researchers agreed with the NIH criteria and grant authorship to individuals that draft the manuscript, analyze and interpret data, and propose ideas. However, thousands of the researchers also value supervision and contributing comments to the manuscript whereas the NIH recommends discounting these activities when attributing authorship. People value the minutiae of research beyond writing and data reduction: researchers in the humanities value it less than those in pure and applied sciences; individuals from Far East Asia and Middle East and Northern Africa value these activities more than anglophones and northern Europeans. While developing national and international collaborations, researchers must recognize differences in peoples values while assigning authorship."

Spikeling is based on an Arduino microcontroller running the computationally efficient Izhikevich model of a spiking neuron. The microcontroller is connected to input ports that simulate synaptic excitation or inhibition, dials controlling current injection and noise levels, a photodiode that makes Spikeling light-sensitive and an LED and speaker that allows spikes to be seen and heard. Output ports provide access to variables such as membrane potential for recording in experiments or digital signals that can be used to excite other connected Spikelings. These features allow for the intuitive exploration of the function of neurons and networks. We also report our experience of using Spikeling as a teaching tool for undergraduate and graduate neuroscience education in Nigeria and the UK."

Twenty-five hundred people were recruited with equal segregation of age (20s, 30s, 40s, and 50s) and gender. We analyzed the association between gender, age, infertility, and ethical view using a questionnaire regarding donor sperm, donor oocyte, donor embryo, gestational surrogacy, and disclosure to offspring.\n\nResults: Of the respondents, 36.2% approved and 26.6% disapproved with gamete or embryo donation. The frequency of those who approved was the lowest in females in the 50-59 years age group, and was significantly higher in males or females with infertility. Secondly, 40.9% approved and 21.8% disapproved with gestational surrogacy. The frequency of those who approved gestational surrogacy was higher in males or females with infertility. Thirdly, 46.3% of respondents agreed and 20.4% disagreed with \""offspring have the right to know their origin\"". Those who disagreed were primarily in the 50-59 age group of both genders, and disagreement was significantly higher in the infertility group compared with non-infertility group.\n\nConclusion: In this study, public attitudes were affected by gender, age, and experience of infertility. These study findings are important in understanding the attitude towards third-party reproduction and disclosure to the offspring. Respondents having indecisive attitudes were >30%, which might indicate an increased requirement for information and education to enhance the discussion on the ethical consensus on third-party reproduction in Japan."

Evidence from an online survey.,"Hauk, O.",Olaf  Hauk,2018-05-24,scientific communication and education,"Cognitive neuroscience increasingly relies on complex data analysis methods. Researchers in this field come from highly diverse scientific backgrounds, such as psychology, engineering and medicine. This poses challenges with respect to acquisition of appropriate scientific computing and data analysis skills, as well as communication among researchers with different knowledge and skills sets. Are researchers in cognitive neuroscience adequately equipped to address these challenges? Here, we present evidence from an online survey of methods skills. Respondents (n=305) mainly comprised students and post-doctoral researchers working in the cognitive neurosciences. Multiple choice questions addressed a variety of basic and fundamental aspects of neuroimaging data analysis, such as signal analysis, linear algebra, and statistics. We analysed performance with respect to the following factors: undergraduate degree (grouped into Psychology, Methods, Biology), current researcher status (undergraduate student, PhD student, post-doctoral researcher), gender, and self-rated expertise levels. Overall accuracy was 72%. Not surprisingly, the Methods group performed best (87%), followed by Biology (73%) and Psychology (66%). Accuracy increased from undergraduate (59%) to PhD (74%) level, but not from PhD to post-doctoral (74%) level. The difference in performance for the Methods versus non-methods (Psychology/Biology) groups was particularly striking for questions related to signal analysis and linear algebra, two areas especially relevant to neuroimaging research. Self-rated methods expertise was not strongly predictive of performance. The majority of respondents (93%) indicated they would like to receive at least some additional training on the topics covered in this survey. In conclusion, methods skills among junior researchers in cognitive neuroscience can be improved, researchers are aware of this, and there is strong demand for more skills-oriented training opportunities. We hope that this survey will provide an empirical basis for the development of bespoke skills-oriented training programmes in cognitive neuroscience institutions."

Early adolescence (12 to 13 years old) is a critical but under-researched demographic for the formation of attitudes related to climate change. This paper presents opinions on the worry, cause, and imminence of climate change that were collected from n=463 1st year secondary school students (12-13 years old) in public secondary schools in inner-urban centres in Austria and Australia. Overall, 86.83% of eligible respondents agreed that climate change was probably or definitely something we should worry about, 80.33% agreed that climate change was probably or definitely caused by humans, and 83.17% agreed that climate change was probably or definitely something that was happening now. The respondents opinions were also compared to their respective adult population, with Australian 12-13 year olds showing strong positive climate-friendly attitudes, both in comparison to their adult population, and to their Austrian peers. In addition, although the opinions of Austrian 12-13 year olds were quite high, they did not reflect the higher climate-friendly opinions of their adult community. Our results suggest that socio-cultural worldview or socio-cultural cognition theory may not have the influence on this age group as it does on the respective adult population - and, if they are affected, there are attitudes or factors in this age group which resist the opinion-influence from their mature community. These findings are significant as early adolescents may be pivotal in the climate science communication arena and investigating their opinions with regard to climate change may offer an unexplored and under-utilised target for future communication efforts and climate literacy programmes."

For these reductions to occur, animal-free alternatives must be made more available and, crucially, must be embraced by researchers. We conducted an international online survey for academics in the field of animal science (N=367) to explore researchers attitudes towards the implementation of animal-free innovations.\n\nThrough this survey we address three key questions. The first question is whether scientists who use animals in their research consider governmental goals for animal-free innovations achievable and whether they would support such goals. Secondly, responders were asked to rank the importance of ten roadblocks that could hamper the implementation of animal-free innovations. Finally, responders were asked whether they would migrate (either themselves or their research) if increased animal research regulations in their country of residence restricted their research. While nearly half (40%) of the responders support governmental goals, the majority (71%) of researchers did not consider such goals achievable in their field within the near future. In terms of roadblocks for implementation of animal-free methods, [~]80% of the responders considered  reliability as important, making it the most highly ranked roadblock. However, all other roadblocks were reported by the majority of responders as somewhat important, suggesting that they must also be considered when addressing animal-free innovations. Importantly, a majority reported that they would consider migration to another country in response to restrictive animal research policy. Thus, governments must consider the risk of researchers migrating to other institutes, states or countries, leading to a  brain-drain if policies are too strict or suitable animal-free alternatives are not available. Our findings suggest that development and implementation of animal-free innovations are hampered by multiple factors. We outline three pillars concerning education, governmental influence and data sharing, the implementation of which may help to overcome these roadblocks to animal-free innovations."
10.1101/332254,Factors Associated with Scientific Misconduct and Questionable Research Practices in Health Professions Education,"Maggio, L. A.; Dong, T.; Driessen, E. W.; Artino, A.",Lauren A Maggio,2018-06-02,scientific communication and education,"IntroductionEngaging in scientific misconduct and questionable research practices (QRPs) is a noted problem across fields, including health professions education (HPE). To mitigate these practices, other disciplines have enacted strategies based on researcher characteristics and practice factors. Thus, to inform HPE, this article seeks to determine which researcher characteristics and practice factors, if any, might explain the frequency of irresponsible research practices.\n\nMethodIn 2017, a cross-sectional survey of HPE researchers was conducted. The survey included 66 items derived from two published QRP surveys and a publication pressure scale adapted from the literature. The study outcome was the self-reported misconduct frequency score, which is a weighted mean score for each respondent on all misconduct and QRP items. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and multiple linear regression analysis.\n\nResults and DiscussionIn total, 590 researchers took the survey. Results from the regression analysis indicated that researcher age had a negative association with the misconduct frequency score (b = -.01, t = -2.91, p<.05) suggesting that older researchers tended to have lower misconduct frequency scores. Publication pressure (b = .20, t = 7.82, p<.001) and number of publications (b = .001, t = 3.27, p<.01) had positive associations with the misconduct frequency score. The greater the publication pressure or the more publications a researcher reported, the higher the misconduct frequency score. Overall, the explanatory variables accounted for 21% of the variance in the misconduct frequency score, and publication pressure was the strongest predictor. These findings provide an evidence base from which HPE might tailor strategies to address scientific misconduct and QRPs."

The mediating role of indebtedness,"Bernabe-Valero, G.; Moret-Tatay, C.; Navarro-Sancho, T.",Carmen  Moret-Tatay,2018-06-11,scientific communication and education,"In this work, we define gratitude, paying attention to interpersonal gratitude and its relationship with dispositional debt. We examined the disposition to feel indebted through analysis of convergence and divergence, exploratory and confirmatory analysis of the most used measurement instrument. The Revised Indebtedness Scale depicted a four factor solution interrelated with a high consistency of content, which allows their labeling and describing. To do this, two samples of university students were selected; one of the sample sizes had 229 Spanish participants and the other 200 participants. Subsequently, a mediation model was tested in which the \""Self-sufficiency and discomfort in receiving help\"" factor mediates the relationship between interpersonal gratitude and the \""Positive relations with others\"" dimension of the Wellbeing scale. The results are discussed in relation to the need for conceptual definition of the constructs in Positive Psychology."

Haggerty,2018-06-13,scientific communication and education,"Survival of junior scientists in academic biomedical research is difficult in todays highly competitive funding climate. National Institute of Health (NIH) data on first-time R01 grantees indicate the rate at which early investigators drop out from a NIH-supported research career is most rapid 4 to 5 years from the first R01 award. The factors associated with a high risk of dropping out, and whether these factors impact all junior investigators equally, are unclear. We identified a cohort of 1,496 investigators who received their first R01-equivalent (R01-e) awards from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases between 2003 and 2010, and studied all their subsequent NIH grant applications through 2016. Ultimately, 57% of the cohort were successful in obtaining new R01-e funding, despite highly competitive conditions. Among those investigators who failed to compete successfully for new funding (43%), the average time to dropping out was 5 years. Investigators who successfully obtained new grants showed remarkable within-person consistency across multiple grant submission behaviors, including submitting more applications per year, more renewal applications, and more applications to multiple NIH Institutes. Funded investigators appeared to have two advantages over their unfunded peers at the outset: they had better scores on their first R01-e grants and they demonstrated an early ability to write applications that would be scored, not triaged. The cohort rapidly segregated into two very different groups on the basis of PI consistency in the quality and frequency of applications submitted after their first R01-e award. Lastly, we identified a number of specific demographic factors, intitutional characteristics, and grant submission behaviors that were associated with successful outcomes, and assessed their predictive value and relative importance for the likelihood of obtaining additional NIH funding."

Unfortunately, research activities had suffered serious setback in tertiary research institutions in Nigeria. This study explores the attitudes, perceptions and barriers to research and publishing among academic staff in Nigerian Institute of Leather and Science Technology, (NILEST) Zaria Nigeria.\n\nMethodA structured self-administered questionnaire was distributed among 130 research and teaching staff at the various Directorates in NILEST. Data are presented in frequencies and percentages for questionnaire responses.\n\nResultExactly 93.85%of the questionnaires were validated for the study which included 81.15% male and 18.85% female. The participant were researchers (26.23%), lecturers (31.15%), Technologist (20.49%) and Instructors (22.13%). The majority of participant agreed that research is important for the institute (90.98%). A total of 81.15% believed that conducting research should be mandatory for all academic staff. Only 44.26% was self-reported to have ongoing research. Some of the obstacles reported to have prevented research activities included: lack of funding (72.13%), lack of professional mentorship (84.43%) and inadequate research facilities (89.34%). Participants without a single published paper were 54.545%. Some of the reasons given for not having published papers were \""no writing experience (95.65%), high publishing fee (79.71%) and long waiting period for peer review (97.10%)\"". The suggestions to improve research status by respondents included\"" provision of research grants/funds (92.62%), provision of internet facilities (95.10%), mandatory publication (26.23%) and appropriate mentorship (34.43%).\n\nConclusionMajority of the respondents believed that research is relevant, only a few were engaged in active research and published articles as evidence. It is therefore recommended that policy makers should devise strategies to focus on active research activities in order to achieve the desire research mandate and goal of institutions in the development of the nations economy."
10.1101/345975,Researchers preferentially collaborate with same-gendered colleagues across the life sciences,"Holman, L.; Morandin, C.",Luke  Holman,2018-06-14,scientific communication and education,"Evidence suggests that women in academia are hindered by conscious and unconscious biases, and often feel excluded from formal and informal opportunities for research collaboration. In addition to ensuring fairness and helping to redress gender imbalance in the academic workforce, increasing womens access to collaboration could help scientific progress by drawing on more of the available human capital. Here, we test whether researchers tend to collaborate with same-gendered colleagues, using more stringent methods and a larger dataset than in past work. Our results reaffirm that researchers co-publish with colleagues of the same gender more often than expected by chance, and show that this  gender homophily is slightly stronger today than it was 10 years ago. Contrary to our expectations, we found no evidence that homophily is driven mostly by senior academics, and no evidence that homophily is stronger in fields where women are in the minority. Interestingly, journals with a high impact factor for their discipline tended to have comparatively low homophily, as predicted if mixed-gender teams produce better research. We discuss some potential causes of gender homophily in science."

Understanding the health issues therefore is the foundation for implementation of viable interventions that assure optimum service delivery. In view of this background, the Paediatric Association of Nigeria (PAN) directed that research into childrens health challenges in Nigeria should be brought to the front burner in the country. Pursuant to this laudable goal this study was conceived to evaluate the research capacity and capability of paediatricians in Nigeria and the institutions they represent. In view of above needs, this study aimed at evaluating the research capacities and challenges among paediatricians.\n\nMethodsThe survey used a cross-sectional nationwide design to enroll paediatricians into the study. The study was a combination of both online and face-to-face survey using questionnaire developed from Research Capacity Assessment Framework. Information on previous research work, challenges encountered, existing capacity and utilization of research outcome were obtained. The SPSS version 20 was used for data entry and analysis. For qualitative variables, similar responses were grouped under thematic heading.\n\nResultsThe response rates for online (via email survey, group-administered in a conference and individual face-to-face (at workshops) were 32 (3.2%), 75 (13.6%) and 15 (60%) respectively. The majority, 87(85.5%) of the participants had conducted prevalence studies, compared to 9 (8.8%) that had done experimental studies. Those who have ever received grant funding for their studies were 21 (19.4%), while the proportion whose research outcome had informed policy update and practice were policy 20 (18.2%). More than 55% of the participants had challenges on some of the seven aspects of research: research topic, proposal, funding, fieldwork, analysis, utilizing findings and collaboration. Less than 40% of the participants had received training on some of the tested 14 research capacity areas except for the area of ethics where 78 (70.9%) reported having received training. For 51 (46.4%) this ethics training included the Good Clinical Practice Guidelines.\n\nConclusionNigerian Academic Paediatricians need to be stimulated to develop interest in research by building their presently low research capacity if future paediatric practice is to be driven significantly by evidence."

The perceptions of these techniques are a barrier to their implementation on a grand scale. Methods to assess the efficacy of approaches to teaching quantitative skills are needed to determine if they effectively overcome social stereotypes and fears of math. In our project we study the effect of a mathematical modeling course in cell biology. We developed four assessments to understand if hands-on modeling increases student understanding of the concepts while simultaneously reducing fear of math. Two concept inventories track students learning gains both in general and specific knowledge to the course content. Two surveys quantify students quantitative confidence and opinions of the usefulness of these techniques in biology. We discuss the effectiveness of our methods and the implications for assessment development in mathematical biology education.

Disclosure of trial results completed by biopharmaceutical industry and non-industry sponsors of at least 30 trials (2006-2015) was assessed using TrialsTracker.\n\nFindingsAmong the top 50 companies, 30 were EFPIA/PhRMA members and 20 were non-members, of which 26 and none, respectively, had a statement on their website committing to the disclosure of trials data. Of 29 377 trials in TrialsTracker, 9511 were industry-sponsored (69 companies) and 19 866 were non-industry-sponsored (254 institutions). The overall mean disclosure rate was 55%, with higher rates for industry (74%) than for non-industry sponsors (46%). Of the 30 companies within the top 50 with data in TrialsTracker, the mean disclosure rate was 76% (77% for EFPIA/PhRMA members [n = 25] versus 67% for non-members [n = 5]).\n\nConclusionsMost of the top 50 biopharmaceutical companies have publicly committed to the disclosure of trial data.

It describes the findings of a 2014-2018 project on the use of vocational education to provide development solutions in the Pacific with an emphasis on climate change and health. An exploratory design was used to investigate how vocational education developed solutions for climate change and health in the 15 Pacific - African Caribbean and Pacific (P-ACP) countries: Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea (PNG), Republic of Marshall Islands (RMI), Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu. Information collected via personal communication with relevant stakeholders, qualitative interviews, documents review, and survey (n=48) of youths and young women in Fiji. Data analysis was performed using thematic analytical strategy and frequency analysis. The study found that vocational education plays a significant role in building the capacity of people to become more sustainable and resilient in their life now and in the future. Also, getting an accredited qualification on health resilience and/or job in the health sector may help them to respond effectively and efficiently in the event of climate change and/or disasters caused by natural hazards. The same factors were explored quantitatively using descriptive analytical strategy, and concluded TVET education, to have a positive influence on climate change and health. As a result, vocational education could provide development solutions for health adaptation in the Pacific. These results indicate global actions for vocational education, that would perfect the course of resilience for these 15 P-ACP in the Pacific and alike in the U.S."

B.; Tonnang, H. Z. E.",Adnan  Aminu Adnan,2018-06-21,scientific communication and education,"Most crop simulation models require the use of Genotype Specific Parameters (GSPs) which provide the Genotype component of GxExM interactions. Estimation of GSPs is the most difficult aspect of most modelling exercises because it requires expensive and time-consuming field experiments. GSPs could also be estimated using multi-year and multi locational data from breeder evaluation experiments. This research was set up with the following objectives: i) to determine GSPs of 10 newly released maize varieties for the Nigerian Savannas using data from both calibration experiments and by using existing data from breeder varietal evaluation trials; ii) to compare the accuracy of the GSPs generated using experimental and breeder data; and iii) to evaluate CERES-Maize model to simulate grain and tissue nitrogen contents. For experimental evaluation, 8 different experiments were conducted during the rainy and dry seasons of 2016 across the Nigerian Savanna. Breeder evaluation data was also collected for 2 years and 7 locations. The calibrated GSPs were evaluated using data from a 4 year experiment conducted under varying nitrogen rates (0, 60 and 120kg N ha-1). For the model calibration using experimental data, calculated model efficiency (EF) values ranged between 0.86-0.92 and coefficient of determination (d-index) between 0.92-0.98. Calibration of time-series data produced nRMSE below 7% while all prediction deviations were below 10% of the mean. For breeder experiments, EF (0.52-0.81) and d-index (0.46-0.83) ranges were lower. Prediction deviations were below 17% of the means for all measured variables. Model evaluation using both experimental and breeder trials resulted in good agreement (low RMSE, high EF and d-index values) between observed and simulated grain yields, and tissue and grain nitrogen contents. We conclude that higher calibration accuracy of CERES-Maize model is achieved from detailed experiments. If unavailable, data from breeder experimental trials collected from many locations and planting dates can be used with lower but acceptable accuracy."

Despite that, data evaluating possible alterations of nucleotides during pet food processing are lacking. The aim of the study was to evaluate the recovery percentage of nucleotides in dry and canned food after processing and storage. Selected dry and canned feed were supplemented with 0.4/100 g dry matter basis of Prosol petMOD. Recovery percentage in dry food was 75% and 74% at the end of technological process and a 12-month shelf-life, while in canned food it was 43% and 41%, respectively. These results support the hypothesis that N could be included during pet food process but industries have to increase the awareness about possible losses, especially in canned food."

J.",Arturo  Casadevall,2018-06-24,scientific communication and education,"The present study analyzed 960 papers published in Molecular and Cellular Biology (MCB) from 2009-2016 and found 59 (6.1%) to contain inappropriately duplicated images. The 59 instances of inappropriate image duplication led to 42 corrections, 5 retractions and 12 instances in which no action was taken. Our experience suggests that the majority of inappropriate image duplications result from errors during figure preparation that can be remedied by correction. Nevertheless, ~10% of papers with inappropriate image duplications in MCB were retracted. If this proportion is representative, then as many as 35,000 papers in the literature are candidates for retraction due to image duplication. The resolution of inappropriate image duplication concerns after publication required an average of 6 h of journal staff time per published paper. MCB instituted a pilot program to screen images of accepted papers prior to publication that identified 12 manuscripts (14.5% out of 83) with image concerns in two months. The screening and correction of papers before publication required an average of 30 min of staff time per problematic paper. Image screening can identify papers with problematic images prior to publication, reduces post-publication problems and requires significantly less staff time than the correction of problems after publication."

All pool estimates (weighted mean difference) were based on random-effects models.\n\nResultsrevealed 16 relevant publications (grant funding from 14 funds, 1980 to 2007 years), all with results from quasi-experimental studies. 45 paired values (ex ante - ex post) for the number of articles published by awarded and rejected applicants were used in the quantitative synthesis. The median average publication activity of awarded applicants before the award process was 2.4 (1.3; 3.4) and after the award process 3.1 (1.7; 4.3) publications per year, for rejected applicants was 1.8 (1.0; 2.9) and 2.4 (1.1; 3.8) respectively. The summation of the results from these studies using the difference-in-differences approach showed that awarded applicants published 0.14 articles per year (95% Cl 0.07 to 0.21) more than rejected applicants (adjusted for publication bias). A meta-regression analysis made it possible to tie together the revealed small difference with the difference-in-differences approach bias - the subsequent differences in the groups are determined by the scale of the initial differences in their publication activity.\n\nConclusionawarded applicants published slightly more often than their rejected opposites. However, this effect may be the result of a bias caused by the shortcomings of the difference-in-differences approach."

As economic and political pressures impacting these enterprises continue to change, the postdoc experience has evolved from short, focused periods of training into often multidisciplinary, extended positions with less clear outcomes. As efforts are underway to amend U.S. federally funded research policies, the paucity of postdoc data has made evaluating the impact of policy recommendations challenging. Here we present comprehensive survey results from over 7,600 postdocs based at 351 academic and non-academic U.S. institutions in 2016. In addition to demographic and salary information, we present multivariate analyses on the factors that influence postdoc career plans and mentorship satisfaction in this population. We further analyze gender dynamics and expose wage disparities and career choice differences. Academic research positions remain the predominant career choice of postdocs in the U.S., although unequally between postdocs based on gender and residency status. Receiving mentorship training during the postdoctoral period has a large, positive effect on postdoc mentorship satisfaction. Strikingly, the quality of and satisfaction with postdoc mentorship appears to also heavily influence career choice. The data presented here are the most comprehensive data on the U.S. postdoc population to date. These results provide an evidence basis for informing government and institutional policies, and establish a critical cornerstone for quantifying the effects of future legislation aimed at the academic and scientific workforce."

N.; Bouwes, N. W.",Stephen  Nicholas  Bennett,2018-06-29,scientific communication and education,"Before-after-control-impact (BACI) experimental designs are commonly used in large-scale experiments to test for environmental impacts. However, high natural variability of environmental conditions and populations, and low replication in both treatment and control areas in time and space hampers detection of responses. We compare the power of two asymmetric BACI (aBACI) designs to two staircase designs for detecting changes in juvenile steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss) abundance associated with a watershed-scale stream restoration experiment. We performed a simulation study to estimate the effect of a 25% increase in steelhead abundance using spatial and temporal estimates of variance from an ongoing study, and determined the power of each design. Experimental designs were then applied to three streams and each stream was composed of three 4 km long sections. We compared the power of a single treatment section in one stream (BACI-1), three simultaneous treatments of all sections in one stream (BACI-3), three sequential treatments in one stream (STAIRCASE-1), and three sequential treatments in one section in each stream (STAIRCASE-3). All designs had [&ge;] 94% power to detect a 25% increase in abundance assuming average variance. Under worst-case variance (i.e., upper 95% confidence limits of historical variance estimates), the STAIRCASE-3 design outperformed the BACI-1, BACI-3, and STAIRCASE-1 designs (i.e., 77%, 41%, 8%, and 33% power respectively). All the designs estimated the effect of the simulated 25% abundance increase, but the length of the confidence interval was much shorter for the STAIRCASE-3 design compared to the other designs, which had confidence intervals 58-596% longer. The STAIRCASE-3 design continued to have high power (88%) to detect a 10% change in abundance, but the power of the other designs was much lower (range 34-56%). Our study demonstrates that staircase designs can have significant advantages over BACI designs and therefore should be more widely used for testing environmental impacts."

While socio-scientific issues (SSI) are increasingly emphasised in science curricula, teachers have low interest in adopting SSI in teaching. Little is known about how teachers choose content for their teaching, although this process translates curricula to teaching practice. We explored how teachers choose content and contexts for biology courses on cells, heredity, and biotechnology by interviewing ten Finnish upper-secondary school teachers. We studied how the teachers described teaching on genetically modified organisms, hereditary disorders, and human traits. Teachers perceptions on genetics teaching were classified to Developmental, Structural and Hereditary approaches. The approaches were connected not only to the teachers perceptions of the more important content, but also teacher inclinations towards teaching genetics in the human context and perceptions of students interest in different topics. Teachers justified their choices by national, local school, and teachers personal-level factors. While teachers mentioned that SSI are important, they were never mentioned among the important contexts. Nevertheless, some teachers embraced teaching genetics in the human context while others avoided them. Teachers justified their avoidance for personal and pedagogical factors, such as their competence in dealing with these contexts. Experience played a part in the approach that teachers had, and contrary to the results of previous research, the less experienced teachers were more open to discussing human genetics. We conclude that curriculum development is important to encourage teachers to adopt more SSI-oriented teaching.

The data analysis indicated that, firstly, the boxers overall level of self-control is high, and the higher the competitive level, the higher the level of self-control. Secondly, there were significant correlations among the Big Five, self-control, and self-efficacy. Thirdly, the mediation model showed that self-efficacy has a significant mediating effect between the Big Five and self-control. These results suggest that formulating training and intervention programs based on the personality traits of boxers and focusing on training their self-efficacy (1) to help them enhance their self-control ability, thereby improving athletic performance and promoting physical and mental health, and (2) to support the inclusion of personality traits, self-efficacy, and self-control among psychological indicators to be assessed in boxers."

The aim of the study was to evaluate mental and physical well-being, as well as their correlates and predictors in a group of employees working at youth educational centres and sociotherapy centres. A total of 96 employees working at youth educational centres and sociotherapy centres in Kujawsko-Pomorskie voivodeship took part in the study. The following psychometric tools were used: the Psychosocial Working Conditions Questionnaire, the Mini-COPE, the LOT-R, and the GSES. The results obtained indicate that people working in helping professions experience mental and physical health problems. Only 3% of the subjects declared they sleep all night. Over 40% and over 35% of the subjects estimate they suffer from low mood and irritation episodes, respectively, rather frequently or continually. Subjects with poorer mental health are more likely to use Helplessness, Avoidance behaviours, or Turning to religion to cope with stress. The strongest predictor of mental well-being is the sense of self-efficacy. Whereas, the strongest predictor of physical well-being is the ability to cope with stress by giving into the feeling of Helplessness. The study demonstrated poor mental and physical well-being of the subjects. A statistically significant correlation was found between sex and the level of mental and physical health. Employees working at youth educational centres and sociotherapy centres with better mental and physical well-being had a stronger sense of self-efficacy and a higher level of life optimism. Hence, the sense of self-efficacy is a predictor for better mental well-being."

E.",Michael E Taveirne,2018-07-05,scientific communication and education,"Many undergraduate introductory microbiology laboratory courses teach basic principles of bacteriology using classical protocol-based experiments, with limited critical thinking and inquiry-based learning practices. We initiated a comprehensive redesign in our General Microbiology Laboratory course to promote scientific critical and creative thinking, while strengthening core microbiology concepts and skills. As part of the redesign, a series of authentic discovery-driven labs, based on cucumber fermentations, were developed as an independent research module within the course curriculum. Integrating discovery-driven labs allowed students to be engaged problem solvers, applying the scientific process to develop hypotheses, design experiments, utilize quantitative reasoning, and effectively communicate results. The inquiry-guided research project was developed to evaluate the minimum concentration of salt (NaCl) required in fermentation brine to safely, and effectively, ferment cucumbers. Over 5 weeks, students assess different aspects of the fermentation process, including quantifying bacterial populations with differential and selective media, measuring pH and glucose concentration of brine solutions, and characterizing the microbial metabolic potential. Additionally, students isolate an unknown bacterium from their fermentations, identifying and characterizing the isolate using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolic tests. Throughout the research project, students collect, graph, and analyze their observations, culminating in students creating and presenting a scientific research poster. With this lab redesign, students generate new knowledge contributing to our understanding of microbial ecology within food fermentations, learn core microbiology skills and techniques, and develop critical and creative thinking skills. The impact of their research is valuable to science educators, researchers, and industry partners."

V.",Rori V.  Rohlfs,2018-07-05,scientific communication and education,"Plentiful evidence shows an historic and continuing gender gap in participation and success in scientific research. However, less attention has been directed at clarifying obscured contributions of women to science. The lack of visible women role models (particularly in computational fields) contributes to a reduced sense of belonging and retention among women. We seek to counteract this cycle by illuminating the contribution of women programmers to the foundation of our own fields--population and evolutionary genetics. We consider past  acknowledged programmers (APs), who developed, ran, and sometimes analyzed the results of early computer programs. Due to authorship norms at the time, these programmers were credited in the acknowledgments sections of manuscripts, rather than being recognized as authors. For example, one acknowledgement reads \""I thanks Mrs. M. Wu for help with the numerical work, and in particular for computing table I.\"". We identified APs in Theoretical Population Biology articles published between 1970 and 1990. While only 7% of authors were women, 43% of APs were women. This significant difference (p = 4.0x10-10) demonstrates a substantial proportion of womens contribution to foundational computational population genetics has been unrecognized. The proportion of women APs, as well as number of APs decreased over time. These observations correspond to the masculinization of computer programming, and the shifting of programming responsibilities to individuals credited as authors (likely graduate students). Finally, we note recurrent APs who contributed to several highly-cited manuscripts. We conclude that, while previously overlooked, historically, women have made substantial contributions to computational biology."

We had interviewed for help seeking behavior by pre-tested modified General Help Seeking Questionnaire. Logistic regression was done and p-value < 0.05 was used for declaration of significant level. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) have been used.\n\nResultsAmong five hundred and forty-eight participants with problematic substance users, only one hundred and sixty-eight (30.7%) sought help for their substance related problems. Participants age above 35 years [AOR = .47 95% CI (.25, .90)], positively screened for common mental disorders [AOR = 4.12, 95% CI (2.7, 6.3)], comorbid medical [AOR = 3.0, 95% CI (1.7, 5.3)], and grand-families history of substance user [AOR = 2.18, 95% CI (1.4, 3.4)] found significantly associated with help seeking.\n\nConclusionThere was low proportion of help seeking behavior among participants with problematic substance users. Advanced age was a barrier to seek help while medical illnesses, common mental disorders and history of substance use in grand families were found to enforce to seek help."
10.1101/367847,High cost of bias: Diminishing marginal returns on NIH grant funding to institutions,"Wahls, W. P.",Wayne P. Wahls,2018-07-13,scientific communication and education,"Scientific output is not a linear function of amounts of federal grant support to individual investigators. As funding per investigator increases beyond a certain point, productivity decreases. This study reports that such diminishing marginal returns also apply for National Institutes of Health (NIH) research project grant funding to institutions. Analyses of data (2006-2015) for a representative cross-section of institutions, whose amounts of funding ranged from $3 million to $440 million per year, revealed robust inverse correlations between funding (per institution, per award, per investigator) and scientific output (publication productivity and citation impact productivity). Interestingly, prestigious institutions had on average 65% higher grant application success rates and 50% larger award sizes, whereas less-prestigious institutions produced 65% more publications and had a 35% higher citation impact per dollar of funding. These findings suggest that implicit biases and social prestige mechanisms (e.g., the Matthew effect) have a powerful impact on where NIH grant dollars go and the net return on taxpayers investments. They support evidence-based changes in funding policy geared towards a more equitable, more diverse and more productive distribution of federal support for scientific research. Success rate/productivity metrics developed for this study provide an impartial, empirically based mechanism to do so."

I.; Harrison, F.",Erin  Connelly,2018-07-16,scientific communication and education,"The pharmacopeia used by physicians and lay people in medieval Europe has largely been dismissed as placebo or superstition. While we now recognise that some of the materia medica used by medieval physicians could have had useful biological properties, research in this area is limited by the labour-intensive process of searching and interpreting historical medical texts. Here, we demonstrate the potential power of turning medieval medical texts into contextualised electronic databases amenable to exploration by algorithm. We use established methodologies from network science to reveal statistically significant patterns in ingredient selection and usage in a key text, the fifteenth-century Lylye of Medicynes, focusing on remedies to treat symptoms of microbial infection. We discuss the potential that these patterns reflect rational medical decisions. In providing a worked example of data-driven textual analysis, we demonstrate the potential of this approach to encourage interdisciplinary collaboration and to shine a new light on the ethnopharmacology of historical medical texts."

R.; Keene, A. C.",Alex C Keene,2018-07-16,scientific communication and education,"Intensive postgraduate courses provide an opportunity for junior and senior level scientists to learn concepts and techniques that will advance their training and research programs. It is commonly assumed that short intensive courses have positive impacts within fields of research; however, these assumptions are rarely tested. Here we describe the framework of a long running postgraduate summer course at Cold Spring Harbor and attempt to quantify the impact made over its history. For over three decades, the Drosophila Neurobiology: Genes, Circuits & Behavior Summer Course at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories (CSHL) has provided participants with intense instruction on a wide variety of topics and techniques in integrative neuroscience using Drosophila as a model organism. Students are introduced to the latest approaches for studying nervous system development, activity and connectivity, as well as complex behaviors and diseases. The course has a long history of successful alumni, many of whom describe participation in the course as foundational to their training. Student surveys of recent participants indicate a high level of satisfaction, improved career outcomes, and direct impact on publications. Analysis of student success reveals that over 64% of participants obtain independent faculty positions. Further, we describe ongoing efforts to enhance diversity and encourage access to scientific research at undergraduate-focused institutions. Together, our findings suggest that laboratory-intensive postgraduate courses provide a highly effective mechanism for scientific training that has lasting positive impacts on trainees."

P.",Lauren A Maggio,2018-07-19,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundConsiderable resources are devoted to producing knowledge about cancer, which in turn is disseminated to policymakers, practitioners, and the public. Online media are a key dissemination channel for cancer research. Yet which cancer research receives media attention is not well understood. Understanding the characteristics of journal articles that receive media attention is crucial to optimize research dissemination.\n\nMethodsThis cross-sectional study examines journal articles on cancer funded by the US government published in 2016, using data from PubMed and Altmetric to determine whether an article received online media attention. Frequencies and proportions were calculated to describe the cancer types and continuum stages covered in journal articles.\n\nResults16.8% of articles published on US government-funded research were covered in the media. Published journal articles addressed all common cancers. Roughly one-fourth to one-fifth of journal articles within each cancer category received online media attention. Media mentions were disproportionate to actual burden of each cancer type (ie, incidence and mortality), with breast cancer articles receiving the most media mentions. Cancer prevention and control articles received less online media attention than diagnosis or therapy articles.\n\nConclusionFindings revealed a mismatch between prevalent cancers and cancers highlighted in the media. Further, journal articles on cancer control and prevention received less media attention than other cancer continuum stages. Media mentions were not proportional to actual public cancer burden nor volume of scientific publications in each cancer category. Results highlight a need for continued research on the role of media, especially online media, in research dissemination."

N.; Pena, C. G.; Fuhrmann, C. N.; Monsalve, G. C.",C. Abigail  Stayart,2018-07-19,scientific communication and education,"In the past year, there has been an exciting groundswell of national efforts to integrate multiple taxonomies for the transparent dissemination and analysis of PhD career outcomes. In this study, we leveraged the unique resources of the Broadening Experiences in Scientific Training Consortium to examine the reliability of the three-tiered Unified Career Outcomes Taxonomy (UCOT v.2017) that was collaboratively developed at a meeting convened by Rescuing Biomedical Research in August 2017. Using an amended version of the UCOT v.2017 (UCOT v.2017-rev1) and a new Supplementary Guidance document, we categorized over 570 PhD alumni records from three different universities. Utilizing Krippendorffs alpha to measure the interrater reliability from nine different individuals, we determined moderate to robust reproducibility within the first two tiers of the taxonomy (Workforce Sector and Career Type); however, the reliability for the third tier (Job Function) did not meet established standards. The team identified significant sources of error, revised category definitions, improved coder training materials and processes, and tested for improved reliability through coding 219 PhD alumni records using the revised taxonomy, UCOT v.2017-rev2. Our results revealed that the changes introduced in UCOT v.2017-rev2 improved inter-rater reliability in all three tiers, and either met or exceeded the acceptable standards for reliability. A final set of clarifications were made to UCOT v.2017-rev2, resulting in UCOT v.2018 and a Finalized Guidance document. Our findings underscore the importance of carefully developing guidance documents to aid coders in the reliable and consistent categorization of alumni career outcomes. We propose periodic assessment of the UCOT v.2018 to address the natural evolution of PhD careers in the global workforce. Ultimately, we hope that UCOT v.2018 will aid in the classification and dissemination of alumni career outcomes that is essential to educating trainees, institutions, and agencies about the diversity of career options for PhDs, and therein empower all PhDs to pursue the careers of their choice."
10.1101/370874,A randomised controlled trial of an Intervention to Improve Compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines (IICARus),"Hair, K.; Macleod, M. R.; Sena, E. S.; IICARus Collaboration,  ",Emily S Sena,2018-07-19,scientific communication and education,"The ARRIVE (Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments) guidelines are widely endorsed but compliance is limited. We sought to determine whether journal-requested completion of an ARRIVE checklist improves full compliance with the guidelines. In a randomised controlled trial, manuscripts reporting in vivo animal research submitted to PLOS ONE (March-June 2015) were allocated to either requested completion of an ARRIVE checklist or current standard practice. We measured the change in proportion of manuscripts meeting all ARRIVE guideline checklist items between groups. We randomised 1,689 manuscripts, 1,269 were sent for peer review and 762 accepted for publication. The request to complete an ARRIVE checklist had no effect on full compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines. Details of animal husbandry (ARRIVE sub-item 9a) was the only item to show improved reporting, from 52.1% to 74.1% (X2=34.0, df=1, p=2.1x10-7). These results suggest that other approaches are required to secure greater implementation of the ARRIVE guidelines.\n\nBackgroundThere are widespread failures across in vivo animal research to adequately describe and report research methods, including critical measures to reduce the risk of experimental bias (Kilkenny et al., 2009, Macleod et al., 2015). Such omissions have been shown to be associated with overestimation of effect sizes (Macleod et al., 2015, Hirst et al., 2014) and are likely to contribute, in part, to translational failure. In an effort to improve reporting standards, an expert working group coordinated by the National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3Rs) developed the Animal Research: Reporting of In Vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines (Kilkenny et al., 2010), published in 2010.\n\nSince the ARRIVE guidelines were first published, they have been endorsed by many journals in their instructions to authors, but this has not been accompanied by substantial improvements in reporting (Baker et al., 2014, McGrath and Lilley, 2015, Gulin et al., 2015a, Avey et al., 2016). Simply endorsing the guidelines does not appear to be sufficient to encourage compliance. Recent findings suggest that following the introduction of mandated completion of a distinct reporting checklist at ten Nature Journals at the stage of first revision significantly improved the quality in reporting versus that of comparator journals (Han et al., 2017, Macleod and The NPQIP Collaborative Group, 2017)\n\nPLOS ONE is an open access online only journal which at the time this study began published around 32,000 research articles per year. Of these, some 5,000 described in vivo research. At present, PLOS ONE instructions to authors encourage compliance with the ARRIVE guidelines, but do not mandate checklist completion. Journals have an important role to play in ensuring that the quality of reporting in the research they publish is robust, yet the most effective mechanism by which they can achieve this remains unclear.\n\nOur aim was to test the impact on the quality of published reports of an intervention which would request, at the time of manuscript submission, that authors complete a checklist detailing where in the manuscript the various components of the ARRIVE checklist were met. This study, to our knowledge, is the first randomised controlled trial of requested ARRIVE guideline completion."

A modular design enables the addition, deletion, or substitution of data sources. To demonstrate the capabilities of ERNIE, we have conducted case studies that span drug development and pharmacogenetics. In these studies, we analyze data from regulatory documents, bibliographic and patent databases, research grant records, and clinical trials, to document collaborations and identify influential research accomplishments."

GRE scores are often assumed to be predictive of student success in graduate school. However, we found no such association in admission data from Vanderbilts Initiative for Maximizing Student Diversity (IMSD), which recruited historically underrepresented students for graduate study in the biomedical sciences at Vanderbilt University spanning a wide range of GRE scores. This study avoids the typical biases of most GRE investigations of performance where only high-achievers on the GRE were admitted. GRE scores, while collected at admission, were not used or consulted for admission decisions and comprise the full range of percentiles, from 1% to 91%. We report on the 29 students recruited to the Vanderbilt IMSD from 2007-2011 who have completed the program at this date. While the data set is not large, the predictive trends between GRE and long-term graduate outcomes (publications, first author publications, time to degree, predoctoral fellowship awards, and faculty evaluations) are remarkably null and there is sufficient precision to rule out even mild relationships between GRE and these outcomes. Career outcomes are encouraging; many students are in postdocs, and the rest are in stage-appropriate career environments for such a cohort, including tenure track faculty, biotech and entrepreneurship careers."

K.",Lisa  Katherine  Marriott,2018-07-26,scientific communication and education,"Impulsivity has been linked to academic performance in the context of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, though its influence on a wider spectrum of students remains largely unexplored, particularly in the context of STEM learning (i.e. science, technology, engineering, and math). STEM learning was hypothesized to be more challenging for impulsive students, since it requires the practice and repetition of tasks as well as concerted attention to task performance. Impulsivity was assessed in a cross-sectional sample of 2,476 students in grades 6-12. Results show impulsivity affects a larger population of students, not limited to students with learning disabilities. Impulsivity was associated with lower sources of science self-efficacy (SSSE) scores, interest in all STEM domains (particularly math), and self-reported STEM skills. The large negative effect observed for impulsivity was opposed by \""growth\"" mindset, which describes a students belief in the importance of effort when learning is difficult. Mindset had a large positive effect, which was associated with greater SSSE, STEM interest, and STEM skills. When modeled together, results suggest that mindset interventions may benefit impulsive students who struggle with STEM. Together, these data suggest important interconnected roles for impulsivity and mindset that can influence secondary students STEM trajectories."

To reach this aim, an online survey was conducted. The analysis was based on descriptive statistics and three logistic regressions models. Results of descriptive statistics showed that citizens in Brazil had mostly negative perceptions about the actual conditions of animal welfare in the poultry, beef, and dairy supply chains. Results of the logistic regression models showed that in the poultry and dairy supply chains, citizens with background in agricultural/veterinary sciences, and citizens who reported a higher level of knowledge about these supply chains, were more likely to perceive as bad the actual conditions of farm animal welfare. In the poultry supply chain, citizens who reported previous contact with poultry farms were also more likely to perceive as bad the actual condition of farm animal welfare. In addition, the perception that farmers are mainly focused on the economic aspect of farming and less on animal welfare, the perception that animals do not have a good quality of life while housed on farms, and the perception that animals are not adequately transported and slaughtered, negatively impact on perceptions about the actual conditions of farm animal welfare in the three supply chains. We concluded that a protocol aimed to improve citizens perceptions about the actual conditions of farm animal welfare should focus in all phases of the supply chains."

T.",Mengistu  Asmamaw,2018-08-01,scientific communication and education,"This study assessed households resilience to climate change-induced shocks in Dinki watershed, northcentral highlands of Ethiopia. The data were collected through cross-sectional survey conducted on 288 households, six focus group discussions and 15 key informant interviews. The Climate Resilience Index (CRI) and the Livelihood Resilience Index (LRI) based on the three-resilience capacities (3Ds) frame, using absorptive, adaptive and transformative, were used to measure households resilience to climate change-induced shocks on agro-ecological unit of analysis. Findings indicate that the CRI and the resilience capacities based on the indexed scores of major components clearly differentiated the study communities in terms of their agro-ecological zones. Specifically, the LRI score showed that absorptive capacity (0.495) was the leading contributing factor to resilience followed by adaptive (0.449) and transformative (0.387) capacities. Likewise, the midland was relatively more resilient with a mean index value of 0.461. The study showed that access to and use of livelihood resources, such as farmlands and livestock holdings, diversity of income sources, infrastructure and social capital were determinants of households resilience. In general, it might be due to their exposure to recurrent shocks coupled with limited adaptive capacities including underdeveloped public services, poor livelihood diversification practices, among others, the study communities showed minimal resilience capacity with a mean score of 0.44. Thus, in addition to short-term buffering strategies, intervention priority focusing on both adaptive and transformative capacities, particularly focusing on most vulnerable localities and constrained livelihood strategies, would contribute to ensure long-term resilience in the study communities."

This paper reports the results from a scoping search performed to clarify possible effectiveness, knowledge gaps, underlying concepts and significance.\n\nObjectivesTo gain insight into knowledge gaps and understanding of the effectiveness, origins and significance of quality circles.\n\nMethodsA search strategy was developed starting with  quality circle in PubMed and the index terms from those articles revealed were then used as search terms to identify further papers. Repeating this process in collaboration with a librarian, search strings relating to quality circles were built, and databases searched up to December 2017. Any paper on structured quality circles or related small group work in primary health care was included when relevant to the objectives.\n\nResultsFrom 11973 citations, 82 background papers and 58 key papers were identified, in addition to 12 books and 10 websites. 19 studies, one paper summarizing three studies and one systematic review suggest that quality circles can be effective in behaviour change, though with varying effect sizes. Quality circles and their techniques are complex, as they are not standardized, and changes seem to depend on the topic and context, which requires further research into how and why they work in order to improve them. From their origins in industry, they are now used in primary health care in many countries for continuous medical education, continuous professional development and quality improvement.\n\nConclusionThe evidence on quality circles indicates that they can successfully change general practitioner behaviour. As they are a complex intervention, theory-driven research approaches are needed to understand and improve their effectiveness. This is of major importance because they play an important role in quality improvement in primary health care in many countries."
10.1101/388678,Measuring researcher independence using bibliometric data: A proposal for a new performance indicator,"Van den Besselaar, P.; Sandström, U.",Peter  Van den Besselaar,2018-08-09,scientific communication and education,"Bibliometric indicators are increasingly used at the individual level - as is exemplified by the popularity of the H-index and many other publication and citation based indicators used in evaluation. The issue isnt whether these indicators can be considered useful, as they do provide a description of a researchers oeuvre. However, at the same time, they are not enough to assess the quality of a researcher and his/her oeuvre: Quality has more dimensions than productivity and impact alone. In this paper, we argue that independence is an equally important characteristic that however lacks validated indicators for measuring it at the individual level. We propose two indicators to measure different dimensions of independence: one assessing whether a researcher has developed an own collaboration network, and another assessing the level of thematic independence. We illustrate how these indicators distinguish between researchers that are equally productive and have similar impact. The independence indicator is a step forward in evaluating individual scholarly quality: in cases where citations and publications do not distinguish, the indicators for independence may do."

Y.; Aweke, Y. H.",Likawunt  Samuel  Asfaw,2018-08-09,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundHealth-seeking behavior is a sequence of actions taken to promote health and prevent disease. Governments expenditure to health is being improved in Ethiopia. In contrast, high disease burden and low health service utilization is observed. The low health service utilization could be due to low health-seeking behavior of the community. Thus, this studywas aimed to determine the level of health-seeking behavior and associated factors in Hosanna town, Southern Ethiopia.\n\nMethodsWe used communitybased cross-sectional study design among community (n= 443) in Hosanna town. The overall health-seeking behavior of study participants was assessed using the mean score of each of the dimensions (health promotion and disease prevention activities) as a cut-off value. Having a score above the mean on each of the target dimensions was equated with having a high level of health seeking behaviour. STATA 12 soft-ware package (Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas, 77845, USA)was used for descriptive and logistic regression analysis.\n\nResultsAbout eighty five percent of (85.4%) participants had low level of health-seeking behavior. Males were about two folds more likely to have low level of health-seeking behavior than females (AOR: 1.8; CI 1.03-3.42). Widowed participants were about five times more likely to have low health-seeking behavior (AOR: 4.8; CI 2.1-17.1) when compared to married participants. Those participants who are illiterate were about five times more likely to have low health-seeking behavior than who completed higher education (AOR: 4.5; CI 1.16-17.8).\n\nConclusionThe study revealed low health-seeking behavior among the study participants in the study area. This finding suggested the need forurgent interventions to the health literacy packages of Ethiopia to enhance the health seeking behavior of the country."

N.",Darren N Saunders,2018-08-13,scientific communication and education,"Cancer research in the news is often associated with sensationalising and inaccurate reporting, giving rise to false hopes and expectations. The role of study selection for cancer-related news stories is an important but less commonly acknowledged issue, as the outcomes of primary research are generally less reliable than those of meta-analyses and systematic reviews. Few studies have investigated the quality of research that makes the news and no previous analyses of the proportions of primary and secondary research in the news have been found in the literature. The main aim of this study was to investigate the nature and quality of cancer research covered in online news reports by four major news sources from USA, UK and Australia. We measured significant variation in reporting quality, and observed biases in many aspects of cancer research reporting, including the types of study selected for coverage, and in the spectrum of cancer types, gender of scientists, and geographical source of research represented. We discuss the implications of these finding for guiding accurate, contextual reporting of cancer research, which is critical in helping the public understand complex science and appreciate the outcomes of publicly funded research, avoid undermining trust in science, and assist informed decision-making."

Six in ten administrators reported they had no power to prevent faculty from signing consulting agreements. Although most respondents identified institutional risks from consulting relationships, many maintained that consulting agreements are \""private.\""\n\nConclusions and relevanceOversight of faculty consulting agreements at U.S. schools of medicine and public health is inconsistent across institutions and usually not robust. The interests at stake suggest the need for stronger oversight."
10.1101/398701,Spatio-temporal variability of soil nutrients and the responses of growth during growth stages of winter wheat in the north of China,"Su, B.; Zhao, G.; Dong, C.",Baowei  Su,2018-08-23,scientific communication and education,"Study on soil nutrient variability and its effect on the growth and development of crop under traditional tillage mode is the foundation to comprehensively implement the precision agriculture policy on the field scale and crop excellent management. In this paper, a winter wheat field of 28.5 hm2 under traditional cultivation model in Tianzhuang town of Huantai county was selected as the research area. Sampling by mesh point method (60x60m), the variation characteristics of soil available nitrogen (AN), available phosphorus (AP) and available potassium (AK) in the before sowing, reviving stage, jointing stage, filling stage of winter wheat were analyzed by the method of geostatistics and GIS. At the same time, Pearson correlation analysis was used to study the response of wheat growth and development to soil nutrient variation. As the growth period goes by, 1) each nutrient showed low-high-low and moderate variability. AN and AK had the highest content at reviving stage, while AP at jointing stage, as turning point. The order of variability of each nutrient was AN>AP>AK. 2) The difference of nutrient variation first increased and then decreased, and showed medium to strong spatial correlation.\n\nThree nutrients in the before sowing stage were strong spatial correlation, and the reviving stage was medium spatial correlation, to the jointing and filling stages, AN was medium spatial correlation, AP and AK were strong spatial correlation. The spatial correlation of each nutrients was the weakest in the reviving stage, and AN was the strongest in the before sowing stage, while AP and AK were strongest in the jointing stage. The spatial correlation of each soil nutrients decreased from before sowing to reviving stage, jointing stage to filling stage, and the spatial correlation increased from reviving stage to jointing stage. 3) Soil nutrient content first increased and then decreased, and the grade of nutrient gradually decreased. 4) The correlation between soil nutrients and wheat growth was gradually increasing. AN had the highest correlation with wheat growth, followed by AK and AP lowest. The effect of soil nutrients on the growth of wheat at the reviving stage was higher than that of the current nutrient, and the growth of wheat at jointing stage was mainly influenced by the current nutrient, while the growth of wheat at the filling period was both influenced by the nutrient content of the last and the current period; the date to supplement fertilizer should be postponed properly. In this study, the soil nutrient dynamics and its influence on the growth of wheat during the winter wheat growth period under the traditional field model were well understood, which could provide a theoretical basis for the precision management of soil nutrients in the northern winter wheat area with relatively uniform planting environment and cultivation management."

This requires less motion to maneuver, and the optical error is decreased. It also improves how novices learn arthroscopy. We hypothesized that surgical performance using this arthroscope is superior to a conventional arthroscope. This study tested the hypothesis using motion analysis and a new validated parameter, \""dimensionless squared jolt\"" (DSJ).\n\nMethodsWe compared the surgical performance using between the wide-angle and the conventional arthroscope among 14 novice orthopedic residents who performed three standardized tasks three times with each arthroscope. The tasks simulated arthroscopic rotator cuff repair surgical skills. Their motion was analyzed using an optical tracking system. The differences in performance parameters, such as time taken, average acceleration of the hands (m/s2), the number of movements, and the total path length (m) including DSJ between the two arthroscopes, were investigated using paired t-tests.\n\nResultsAll the estimated values for the tasks using the 150{degrees} arthroscope were lower than those for the 105{degrees} arthroscope. There were statistically significant differences in performance between the two arthroscopes only for DSJ (p = 0.014) and average acceleration (p = 0.039).\n\nConclusionsDSJ and average acceleration are reliable parameters for representing hand-eye coordination. The surgical performance of novice arthroscopists was better with the new wide-angle arthroscope than with the conventional arthroscope."

M.; Chongolo, A. M.; Kibiki, G. S.; Heysell, S. K.",Stellah  George  Mpagama,2018-08-28,scientific communication and education,"IntroductionMolecular diagnostics have revolutionized the diagnosis of multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Yet in Tanzania we found delay in diagnosis with more than 70% of MDR-TB patients having history of several previous treatment courses for TB signaling complications of prior missed diagnosis. We aimed to explore patients viewpoints and experiences with personal and socio-behavioral obstacles from MDR-TB diagnosis to treatment in an attempt to understand these prior findings.\n\nMethodsThe study was conducted in December 2016 with MDR-TB patients admitted at Kibongoto Infectious Diseases Hospital. We used semi-structured interviews and focus group discussion to examine patients views and experiences during MDR-TB diagnosis. Groups were sex aggregated to allow free interaction and to gauge gender specific issues in the social and behavioral contexts. The discussion - explored patients delivery factors that were impacting delay from MDR-TB diagnosis to treatment. Iterative data collection and analysis was applied with data, codes and categories being compared and refined.\n\nResultsForty-five MDR-TB patients participated in 6 focus group discussions. Challenges and barriers contributing to the delay from MDR-TB diagnosis to treatment were as follows: 1) The general population had differing understanding of MDR-TB that led to seeking services from traditional healers; 2) Also socio-economic adversity made health-seeking behavior difficult and often unproductive; 3) In the health system, challenges included inadequacy of MDR-TB diagnostic centers, lack of knowledge on behalf of health care providers to consider MDR-TB and order appropriate diagnostics; 4) Insufficiency in the specimen referral system for early diagnosis of MDR-TB. Non-adherence of TB patients to first-line anti-TB drugs prior to MDR-TB diagnosis given the multitude of barriers discussed was coupled with both intentional and unintentional non-adherence of health care providers to international standards of TB care.\n\nConclusionPatient-centered strategies bridging communities and the health system are urgently required for optimum MDR-TB control in Tanzania."

A.; Olsson, S.; Spinewine, A.; Speybroeck, N.",Helen  Byomire  Ndagije,2018-08-28,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundThe patients that experience adverse events are in the best position to report them, only if they were empowered to do so. Systematic community engagement and support to patients in a rural setting to monitor any potential harm from medicines should provide evidence for patient safety.\n\nMethodsThis paper describes an uncontrolled before and after study aimed at assessing the effect of a community engagement strategy, the Community Dialogues and Sensitization (CDS) intervention between January and April 2017, on the knowledge, attitude and practice of reporting adverse drug events by community members in the two eastern Ugandan districts. A representative cross-sectional baseline household survey was done prior to the intervention in September 2016 (n=1034) and the end-line survey (n=827) in July 2017.\n\nResultsAfter implementation of the CDS intervention, there was an overall 20% (95% CI=16- 25) increase in awareness about adverse drug events in the community. The young people (15- 24 years) demonstrated a 41% (95% CI =31-52) increase and the un-educated showed a 50% (95% CI=37-63) increase in awareness about adverse drug events. The attitudes towards reporting increased overall by 5% in response to whether there was a need to report ADEs (95% CI =3-7). An overall 115% (95% CI =137-217) increase in the population that had ever experienced ADEs was also reported.\n\nConclusionOur evaluation shows that the CDS intervention increases knowledge, improves attitudes by catalyzing discussions among community members and health workers on health issues and monitoring safety of medicines."

R.",Cassidy R Sugimoto,2018-08-29,scientific communication and education,"The fairness of scholarly peer review has been challenged by evidence of disparities in publication outcomes based on author demographic characteristics. To assess this, we conducted an exploratory analysis of peer review outcomes of 23,876 initial submissions and 7,192 full submissions that were submitted to the biosciences journal eLife between 2012 and 2017. Women and authors from nations outside of North America and Europe were underrepresented both as gatekeepers (editors and peer reviewers) and authors. We found evidence of a homophilic relationship between the demographics of the gatekeepers and authors and the outcome of peer review; that is, there were higher rates of acceptance in the case of gender and country homophily. The acceptance rate for manuscripts with male last authors was seven percent, or 3.5 percentage points, greater than for female last authors (95% CI = [0.5, 6.4]); this gender inequity was greatest, at nine percent or about 4.8 percentage points (95% CI = [0.3, 9.1]), when the team of reviewers was all male; this difference was smaller and not significantly different for mixed-gender reviewer teams. Homogeny between countries of the gatekeeper and the corresponding author was also associated with higher acceptance rates for many countries. To test for the persistence of these effects after controlling for potentially confounding variables, we conducted a logistic regression including document and author metadata. Disparities in acceptance rates associated with gender and country of affiliation and the homophilic associations remained. We conclude with a discussion of mechanisms that could contribute to this effect, directions for future research, and policy implications. Code and anonymized data have been made available at https://github.com/murrayds/elife-analysis\n\nAuthor summaryPeer review, the primary method by which scientific work is evaluated, is ideally a fair and equitable process in which scientific work is judged solely on its own merit. However, the integrity of peer review has been called into question based on evidence that outcomes often differ between male and female authors, and for authors in different countries. We investigated such disparities at the biosciences journal eLife by analyzing the demographics of authors and gatekeepers (editors and peer reviewers), and peer review outcomes of all submissions between 2012 and 2017. Outcomes were more favorable for male authors and those affiliated with institutions in North America and Europe; these groups were also over-represented among gatekeepers. There was evidence that peer review outcomes were influenced by homophily --a preference of gatekeepers for manuscripts from authors with shared characteristics. We discuss mechanisms that could contribute to this effect, directions for future research, and policy implications."

L.",Jacqueline  Louise  Stroud,2018-08-31,scientific communication and education,"Earthworms are primary candidates for national soil health monitoring as they are ecosystem engineers that benefit both food production and ecosystem services associated with soil security. Supporting farmers to monitor soil health could help to achieve the policy aspiration of sustainable soils by 2030 in England; however, little is known about how to overcome participation barriers, appropriate methodologies (practical, cost-effective, usefulness) or training needs. This paper presents the results from a pilot #60minworms study which mobilised farmers to assess over >1300 ha farmland soils in spring 2018. The results interpretation framework is based on the presence of earthworms from each of the three ecological groups at each observation (20cm3pit) and spatially across a field (10 soil pits). Results showed that most fields have basic earthworm biodiversity, but 42 % fields may be at risk of over-cultivation as indicated by absence/rarity of epigeic and/or anecic earthworms; and earthworm counting is not a reliable indicator of earthworm biodiversity. Tillage had a negative impact (p < 0.05) on earthworm populations and organic matter management did not mitigate tillage impacts. In terms of farmer participation, Twitter and Farmers Weekly magazine were highly effective channels for recruitment. Direct feedback from participants included excellent scores in trust, value and satisfaction of the protocol (e.g. 100 % would do the test again) and 57 % would use their worm survey results to change their soil management practices. A key training need in terms of earthworm identification skills was reported. The trade-off between data quality, participation rates and fieldwork costs suggests there is potential to streamline the protocol further to #30minuteworms (5 pits), incurring farmer fieldwork costs of approximately {pound}1.48 ha-1. At national scales, {pound}14 million pounds across 4.7 M ha-1 in fieldwork costs per survey could be saved by farmer participation."

The trainee dentists conducted initial interviews with the SPs after completing the Japanese version of the Jefferson Scale of Empathy. Their interviews were recorded and analyzed using the Roter Interaction Analysis System. The SPs assessed the trainees communication immediately after each interview. The trainee dentists were classified into two groups (more positive and less positive groups) according to SP assessment scores.\n\nResultsCompared with the less positive trainees, the more positive trainees scored higher on the [Emotional expression] and lower on the [Medical data gathering] Roter Interaction Analysis System categories. There was no difference in [Dental data gathering] between the two groups. The SPs of more positive trainees had higher rates of [Positive talk] and [Emotional expression] and lower rates of [Medical information giving] and [Dental information giving]. The trainees with more positive ratings from SPs had significantly higher Jefferson Scale of Empathy total scores.\n\nConclusionThe results of this study suggest that responding to the SPs emotions is a relevant characteristic of dentist-SP communication to SPs positive assessment in medical interviews. Further, trainees self-reported empathy was related with the SPs assessment of trainees communication, which indicated that patient satisfaction can be improved by increasing the dentists empathy. Thus, an empathic attitude among dentists is a significant determinant of patient satisfaction."

S.",Tesfa Dejenie Habtewold,2018-09-04,scientific communication and education,"IntroductionGlobally, there has been a dramatic increment of narrative reviews, systematic reviews and overview publication rates. In Ethiopia, only small number of reviews are published and no overviews conducted in biomedical and public health disciplines. Therefore, we aimed to (1) assess the trend of narrative and systematic reviews in Ethiopia, (2) examine their methodological quality and (3) suggest future directions for improvement.\n\nMethodsPubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, SCOPUS, CINHAL, WHO Global Index Medicus, Cochrane Library and PsycINFO electronic databases were searched and supplemented by hand searching as well. All narrative reviews and systematic reviews with or without a meta-analysis from 1970 to April 2018 were included. The International Narrative Systematic assessment (INSA) for narrative reviews and A MeaSurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR-2) for systematic reviews with or without a meta-analysis were used for quality appraisal. Fishers exact test at the p-value threshold of 0.05 was used to compare the differences in methodological quality.\n\nResultsOf the 2,201 initially identified articles, 106 articles published from 1970 to 2018 were eligible for full-text review. Among included reviews, 50.9% were narrative reviews, 16% were systematic reviews and 33.1% were systematic reviews with meta-analyses. Twenty-nine percent were published in Ethiopia and 43.4% were published after 2015. 85.1% of narrative reviews poorly described the characteristics of included studies and 63.8% did not report a conflict of interest. In systematic reviews, 89.6%, 91.7%, and 100% did not register/publish the protocol, justifying the selection of the study designs for inclusion and report sources of funding for the primary studies respectively. Overall, 55.3% of narrative reviews and 75% of systematic reviews with or without meta-analysis had poor methodological quality.\n\nConclusionsAlthough publication rate of narrative and systematic reviews have risen in Ethiopia, half of the narrative reviews and three-quarters of the systematic reviews had poor methodological quality.

G.",Emmanuel G. REYNAUD,2018-09-06,scientific communication and education,"The glass models of invertebrates crafted by Leopold and Rudolf Blaschka were made between 1863 and 1889. Production ceased when the glassmakers turned their attention to what is now known as the Ware Collection of Blaschka Glass Models of Plants, created for the Harvard Museum of Natural History. Nearly 130 years have passed since their last published catalogue of species in 1888 and the nomenclature they applied is now a confusing mix that includes many junior synonyms and unavailable names. This is an issue for many museums and universities which owns Blaschka models as uncertain identifications may compromised interpretation of this rediscovered legacy. Nowadays, many museums and universities hold collections of those glass invertebrates but misspelled, mislabelled or simply apply the century old taxonomy of 1888. Here, we provide a valuable resource for curators and enthusiasts alike. We studied and updated the final catalogue 1888 from the Blaschkas Dresden-based workshop. We first focused on major taxonomical changes from taxa to species, as well as on an analysis of the acknowledged authorities. We found that only 35.3% of the models retain their original names, while 3.7% lack any known synonym and their identity remains open to interpretation. Finally, two of the authorities listed in the catalogue, Ernst Haeckel and Philip Henry Gosse, were incorrectly acknowledged for an extensive range of models. This study is the first of its kind on the Blaschka collection, and it will help in the identification and naming of Blaschka models worldwide."

There is little empirical data on the process of and aims for selecting participants, and to what extend lay people involved in research can and should be representative of the population at large. To explore practices and perceptions on these issues and on future PPI conduct more generally, we sent an electronic survey to authors who published involvement activities as part of their studies in medical and social science journals. We identified such authors with a systematic search of five databases and applied descriptive statistics for analysis. Of those who returned the survey (n=127 of 315; 40%), most had previously conducted involvement activities (73%). 45% reported more than one type of involvement, e.g. consultation and deliberation and participation (14%) and to have recruited more than one type of participant for their PPI activity (56%), e.g.  lay publics and  expert publics (33% of 71). Representativeness was seen by most respondents as a crucial objective when recruiting participants, while less than half found the recruitment of suitable participants very easy (9%) or rather easy (34%). Many respondents found it generally difficult (52%) or very difficult (17%) to achieve good representativeness. They identified significant respective challenges and desired more guidance on various aspects of planning and conducting PPI (56%). 55% thought that the concept of \""involvement\"" should be changed or improved. We conclude that participant recruitment and representativeness are controversial in current PPI practice given the manifold challenges mentioned by the survey respondents. Our findings may inform further research particularly regarding- the potentially large number of - unpublished PPI activities."

The Evaluator enables digital resources to be assessed objectively and transparently. We illustrate its application to three widely used generalist repositories - Dataverse, Dryad, and Zenodo - and report their feedback. Evaluations allow communities to select relevant Metric subsets to deliver FAIRness measurements in diverse and specialized applications. Evaluations are executed in a semi-automated manner through Web Forms filled-in by a user, or through a JSON-based API. A comparison of manual vs automated evaluation reveals that automated evaluations are generally stricter, resulting in lower, though more accurate, FAIRness scores. Finally, we highlight the need for enhanced infrastructure such as standards registries, like FAIRsharing, as well as additional community involvement in domain-specific data infrastructure creation."

In medical education, ICTs allow physicians to update their knowledge and remember the necessary information within reach of current mobile devices. ICTs as preparation tools for medical education have not been reported for medical students in Mexico.

MethodologyTo assess the use of mobile devices as ICTs with medical education purposes, we distributed a questionnaire through an online survey management system to all the medical students (n=180) from a private university in Mexico City, 100% agreed to participate. We developed a questionnaire based on previous surveys and adapted it to our university.

ResultsAll participants reported possession of an electronic mobile device, and 95% used it regularly for learning purposes. Regardless of the school year, the most frequent usage given to these devices was the search and reading of medical articles, the use of medical calculators, and taking notes. As the levels in career advances, there was a reduction in the use of electronic devices. According to the students, the main barriers towards using mobile devices for learning purposes were both the lack of access to the Internet and permission from the professor to use them.

ConclusionMost medical students use mobile devices for learning purposes, but usage changes during their education. It is convenient to encourage the use of mobile devices and the development of ICT skills as tools for educational purposes rather than banning their use in schools and hospitals."

V.",Edwin Vincent Sperr,2018-09-23,scientific communication and education,"ObjectivePubMed Clinical Queries are subdivided into \""Broad\"" and \""Narrow\"" versions. These versions are tuned to maximize either retrieval or sensitivity using two different sets of keywords and MeSH headings. While a searcher might assume that all items retrieved by Filter name/Narrow would also be found in the set Filter name/Broad, this is not explicitly guaranteed. It is the purpose of this study to quantify the overlap between these two sets and confirm whether Filter/Narrow is always a subset of Filter/Broad.\n\nMethodsFor each of the five PubMed Clinical Queries, PubMed was searched for citations matching the query Filter/Narrow NOT Filter/Broad. This number was compared with that for Filter/Broad to compute a \""degree of discordance\"" between the two sets. This process was then repeated for the MeSH headings for \""Medicine\"" and \""Diseases\"" as well as for a set of test searches.\n\nResultsFour of the five Clinical Queries returned citations using Filter/Narrow that were not found with Filter/Broad. Discordances between the sets Broad and Narrow were generally modest for \""Etiology\"", \""Diagnosis\"" and \""Clinical prediction guides\"". \""Prognosis\"" was notably more discordant - a searcher could easily miss one Prognosis/Narrow citation for every ten citations she retrieves when using Prognosis/Broad alone for a given search.\n\nConclusionsUsers of the Clinical Queries apart from \""Therapy\"" who are interested in retrieving as many relevant citations as possible should consider combining Filter/Narrow together with Filter/Broad in their search strategy. This is particularly true for \""Prognosis\"", as otherwise the risk of missing relevant citations is substantial."

For contemporaneous evaluation of PPI, a psychometric questionnaire and an open source tool for its evaluation were developed. The questionnaire measures information, procedural and quality assessment. Combined with the open source evaluation tool, researchers are notified if PPI is unsatisfactory in any of these areas.

On the other hand, data summaries are often used in graphs since they aid interpretation. State-of-the art data visualizations can be made with the ggplot2 package, which uses the ideas of a  grammar of graphics to generate a graphic from multiple layers of data. However, ggplot2 requires coding skills and an understanding of the tidy data structure. To democratize state-of-the-art data visualization of raw data with a selection of statistical summaries, a web app was written using R/shiny that uses the ggplot2 package for generating plots. A multilayered approach together with adjustable transparency offers a unique flexibility, enabling users can to choose how to display the data and which of the data summaries to add. Four data summaries are provided, mean, median, boxplot, violinplot, to accommodate several types of data distributions. In addition, 95% confidence intervals can be added for visual inferences.

Gender disparity continues to be an issue in STEM, with progress requiring consistent and focused efforts. Here, we present a data-driven approach to promote high quality, gender balanced invited speaker selection for neuroscience conferences. We have targeted invited speaker opportunities because underrepresentation of female speakers at international neuroscience conferences remains a major problem, and such opportunities are critical for career development. First, we audited the top ten neuroscience journals (indexed by SCImago Journal and Country Rank; SJR), identifying (1) highly cited papers, (2) gender of first and last authors, and (3) field-weighted citation impact and total publications of first and last authors. Second, we used these data to establish a database of high quality scientists that could be used to select speakers for conferences. We found that research quality (as indexed by field-weighted citation impact and total publications) of authors of highly cited publications in the top 10 neuroscience journals did not differ significantly for females and males. The comparison between the gender base rate in neuroscience and authors publishing highly cited papers in high-quality neuroscience journals shows that female representation, particularly at last author level, is less than the estimated base rate for neuroscience. In summary, we present a data-driven approach to invited speaker selection that would facilitate gender balanced conference programs while maintaining the highest of scientific standards. This approach minimizes the influence of implicit gender bias in speaker selection decisions by using scientific quality metrics that STEM researchers are familiar with, and indeed use to evaluate their own performance. Having an immediate effect on reducing gender disparity in conference programs, our approach would generate a positive spiral for more long-term reduction of gender disparity in STEM."

T.; Chalkidou, K.; Teerawattananon, Y.; Sculpher, M.; Wilkinson, T.; Walker, D.; Neumann, P. J.; Kim, D. D.",David  D.  Kim,2018-10-01,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundThe iDSI reference case, originally published in 2014, aims to improve the quality and comparability of cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs). This study assesses whether the development of the guideline has improved the reporting and methodology for CEAs using disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs).\n\nMethodsWe analyzed the Tufts Medical Center Global Health CEA Registry to identify cost-per-DALY averted studies published from 2011 to 2017. Among each of 11 principles in the iDSI reference case, we translated all reporting standards and methodological specifications into quantifiable yes/no questions and awarded articles one point for each item satisfied. We then separately calculated reporting and methods scores, measured as percent adherence (0%=no adherence, 100%=full adherence). Using the year 2014 as the dissemination period, we conducted a pre-post analysis. Additionally, we conducted an analysis stratified by the 11 principles and examined different scoring strategies and dissemination periods in sensitivity analyses.\n\nResultsArticles averaged 74% adherence to reporting standards and 60% adherence to methodological specifications. Adherence to reporting standards increased slightly over time (72% pre-2014 vs. 75% post-2014, p<0.01), but methodological adherence did not significantly improve (59% pre-2014 vs. 60% post-2014, p=0.53). Overall, reporting adherence scores exceeded methodology adherence scores (74% vs. 60%, p<0.001). Articles seldom addressed budget impact (9% reporting, 10% methodology) or equity (7% reporting, 7% methodology).\n\nConclusionsThe iDSI reference case has substantial potential to serve as a useful resource for researchers and policy-makers in global health settings, but greater effort to promote adherence and awareness is needed to achieve its potential."

Owing to the absence of dengue vaccination, effective preventive measure is critical for controlling of dengue fever. This study aimed to explore the individual risk factors of dengue virus infection in Guangdong Province, as well as to provide a scientific basis for prevention and supervision of dengue fever in future.\n\nMethodsA case-control study including 237 cases and 237 controls was performed. The data was collected from the epidemiological questionnaires. Univariate analysis was used for preliminary screening of 28 variables potentially related to dengue virus infection, and an unconditioned logistic regression analysis was used for multivariate analysis to analysis those statistically significant variables.\n\nResultsMultivariate analysis of the result showed three independent risk factors: activities in the park (odd ratio [OR]= 1.70, 95%CI 1.03 to 2.83), outdoor sports (OR= 1.67, 95%CI 1.07 to 2.62), and poor indoor daylight quality (OR= 2.27, 95%CI 1.00 to 5.15); and two protective factors: two persons per room (OR=0.43, 95%CI 0.28 to 0.67), three persons and above per room (OR=0.43, 95%CI 0.22 to 0.86), using air-condition (OR=0.43, 95%CI 0.20 to 0.93).\n\nConclusionThese results are conducive to learn the risk factors for dengue virus infection in Guangdong Province. It is crucial to provide effective and efficient strategy to improve environmental protection and anti-mosquito measures. In addition, more systematic studies are needed to explore the other potential risk factors for dengue fever infection.\n\nAuthor summaryDengue fever, one of the mosquito-borne infectious diseases, is mainly transmitted by Aedes aegypti in Asia and Southeast Asia countries. Since 1978, the incidence of dengue fever has markedly increased in China especially in Guangdong province. In order to formulate the effective prevention and control measures, we explored the risk factors of dengue virus infection in Guangdong Province by conducting a case-control study. In this study, 237 patients with dengue virus infection and 237 participants without dengue virus infection were included. Then through these questionnaires and data analysis, we found that activities in the park, outdoor sports, and poor indoor daylight quality significantly contributed to the residents risk of dengue virus infection. On the other hand, we observed that using air-condition and using anti-mosquito measures were effective personal prevention interventions."

Academic Leadership is a strategy where selected Faculty act to influence peers to adopt change. The Universite de Montreal medical school, has adopted this strategy to implement CBME.\n\nPurposeThis paper aims to describe the work of Academic Leaders in the process of CBME implementation and to explore relevance of the Nonaka and Toyama organizational learning theory to map implementation progress.\n\nMethodBecause knowledge creation model focuses on the relationships between leaders and social structures, embedded case study was selected. Diverse sampling method was used to select three departments: internal medicine, surgery and psychiatry, based on the number of CBME training activities. Data collection was at two intervals, two years apart. Semi-structured interviews (individual and group) were conducted with Department Heads and Academic Leaders. Thematic analysis was conducted on the 15 interview transcriptions.\n\nResultsAs implementation begins, Leaders critically revisit accepted teaching routines and develop a common conception of CBME. This enables leaders to communicate with a wider audience and work within existing committees and working groups where they \""break down\"" CBME into practical concepts. This practical understanding, disseminated through Entrustable Professional Activities, enables observable change.\n\nConclusionLeaders roles evolved from an \""expert\"" that disseminates knowledge about CBME through lectures, to a responsive and pragmatic supporting role by developing and writing practical tools in collaboration with peers and program directors."
10.1101/441170,The role of climate change education on individual lifetime carbon emissions,"Cordero, E. C.; Centeno, D.; Todd, A. M.",Eugene  C.  Cordero,2018-10-11,scientific communication and education,"Strategies to mitigate climate change often center on clean technologies such as electric vehicles and solar panels, while the mitigation potential of a quality educational experience is rarely discussed. In this paper, we investigate the long-term impact that an intensive one-year university course had on individual carbon emissions by surveying students at least five years after having taken the course. A majority of course graduates reported pro-environmental decisions (i.e., type of car to buy, food choices) that can be attributed to experiences gained in the course. Furthermore, our carbon footprint analysis demonstrates that for the average course graduate, these decisions reduced their individual carbon emissions by 2.86 tons of CO2 per year. Focus group interviews identify that course graduates have developed a strong personal connection to climate change solutions, and this is realized in their daily behaviors and through their professional careers. The paper discusses in more detail the specific components of the course that are believed to be most impactful, and it shares preliminary outcomes from similar curriculum designs that are being used with K-12 students. Our analysis also demonstrates that if similar education programs were applied at scale, the potential reductions in carbon emissions would be of similar magnitude to other large-scale mitigation strategies such as rooftop solar or electric vehicles."

Motion analysis systems are widely employed to identify movement deficiencies - e.g. patterns that potentially increase the risk of injury or inhibit performance. However, findings across studies are often conflicting in respect to what a movement deficiency is or the magnitude of the relationship to a specific injury. To test the information content of movement data, a framework was build to differentiate between movements performed by a control (NORM) and abnormal (IMP-L and IMP-C) cohort using solely movement data. Movement data was recorded during jumping, hopping and change of direction exercises and was mathematically decomposed into subject scores. Subjects scores were then used to identify the most appropriate machine learning technique, which was subsequently utilized to create a prediction model that classified if a movement was performed by: IMP-L, IMP-C or NORM. The Monte Carlo method was used to obtain a measure of expected accuracy for each step within the analysis. Findings demonstrate that even the worst classification model outperformed the best guess observed and that not all members of the NORM group represent a NORM pattern as they were repeatedly classified as IMP-L or IMP-C. This highlights that some NORM limbs share movement characteristics with the abnormal group and consequently should not be considered when describing NORM."

M.",Lem  Ngongalah,2018-10-17,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundInsufficient research is a major impediment to growth, development and advancement of health in Africa. Africa produces less than 1% of global research output. Meanwhile, African countries face some of the toughest challenges worldwide, most of which can only be tackled through robust and efficient research. Addressing the barriers to conducting research in Africa is a step towards improving research capacity and output. This study aimed to identify the key challenges affecting research practice and output in Africa; and to highlight priority areas for improvement.\n\nMethodsA cross-sectional survey was administered through an online questionnaire, including participants from six countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Participants included research professionals, research students, research groups and academics.\n\nResultsA total of 424 participants responded to this survey. The ability to conduct and produce high-quality research was seen to be influenced by multiple factors, most of which were related to the research environment in African countries. Priority areas for improvement included providing more training, raising awareness on the importance of research in Africa, encouraging governments to commit to research and increasing collaboration between researchers in Africa.\n\nConclusionThe conditions under which research is done in Africa are severely flawed and do not encourage engagement in research, or continuity of research activity. African governments need to develop initiatives that accelerate and support research and research-based education in Africa, in order to build a solid foundation for research, increase research capacity, and enable institutions to provide valuable training and develop sustainable research opportunities in Africa."
10.1101/443499,"The History, Advocacy and Efficacy of Data Management Plans","Smale, N.; Unsworth, K. J.; Denyer, G.; Barr, D. P.",Nicholas  Smale,2018-10-17,scientific communication and education,"Data management plans (DMPs) have increasingly been encouraged as a key component of institutional and funding body policy. Although DMPs necessarily place administrative burden on researchers, proponents claim that DMPs have myriad benefits, including enhanced research data quality, increased rates of data sharing, and institutional planning and compliance benefits.\n\nIn this manuscript, we explore the international history of DMPs and describe institutional and funding body DMP policy. We find that economic and societal benefits from presumed increased rates of data sharing was the original driver of mandating DMPs by funding bodies. Today, 86% of UK Research Councils and 63% of US funding bodies require submission of a DMP with funding applications. Given that no major Australian funding bodies require DMP submission, it is of note that 37% of Australian universities have taken the initiative to internally mandate DMPs.\n\nInstitutions both within Australia and internationally frequently promote the professional benefits of DMP use, and endorse DMPs as  best practice. We analyse one such typical DMP implementation at a major Australian institution, finding that DMPs have low levels of apparent translational value. Indeed, an extensive literature review suggests there is very limited published systematic evidence that DMP use has any tangible benefit for researchers, institutions or funding bodies.\n\nWe are therefore led to question why DMPs have become the go-to tool for research data professionals and advocates of good data practice. By delineating multiple use-cases and highlighting the need for DMPs to be fit for intended purpose, we question the view that a good DMP is necessarily that which encompasses the entire data lifecycle of a project. Finally, we summarise recent developments in the DMP landscape, and note a positive shift towards evidence-based research management through more researcher-centric, educative, and integrated DMP services."

Honorary authorship is the inclusion of authors who do not meet the criteria established by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) authorship guidelines. The inclusion of honorary authors in the medical literature has led to an increase of the number of authors on studies and a decrease in single author studies in various fields.\n\nMethodsOur primary objective was to assess authorship trends in two major pulmonology journals (selected on the basis of Google Scholar rankings): Thorax and American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. We reviewed all articles published in both journals in the years 1994, 2004, and 2014 using Web of Science and extracted data such as number of authors and gender of the first and last authors.\n\nResultsThe total number of authors steadily increased from 1994 to 2014. The median number of authors grew from about four in 1994 to nearly seven in 2014, which is approximately a 75% increase. When we compiled all the data, we found the percentage of female authors from both journals had increased from 17% to 29.9% during the study period.\n\nDiscussionWe found an increase in the average number of authors on pulmonology publications between 1994 and 2014 as well as an increase in the number of females with a lead or main author position. This may be due to a variety of factors, such as increased team science. However, our data in conjunction with data from other areas of medicine, indicate that honorary authorship may be contributing to the trends we identified."

G.",Marcell  Csanédi,2018-10-25,scientific communication and education,"This study aimed to investigate the distribution of European Union (EU) healthcare research grants across EU countries, and to study the effect of the potential influencing factors on grant allocation. We analysed publicly available data on healthcare research grants from the 7th Framework Programme and the Horizon 2020 Programme allocated to beneficiaries between 2007 and 2016. Grant allocation was analysed at the beneficiary-, country-, and country group-level (EU-15 versus newer Member States, defined as EU-13). The investigated country-level explanatory variables included GDP per capita, population size, overall disease burden, and healthcare research excellence. Grant amounts per 100,000 inhabitants was used as an outcome variable in the regression analyses.\n\nResearch funds were disproportionally allocated to EU-15 versus the EU-13, as 96.9% of total healthcare grants were assigned to EU-15 countries. At the beneficiary level, EU funding was positively influenced by participating in previous grants. The average grant amount per beneficiary was higher for EU-15 organizations. In univariate regression analyses at the country level, higher GDP per capita (p<0.001) and better medical research excellence (p<0.001) were associated with more EU funding, and a higher disease burden was associated with less EU funding (p=0.003). In the multiple regression analysis GDP per capita (p=0.002) and research excellence (p<0.001) had a significant positive association with EU funding. Population size had an inverted U-shaped relationship with EU funding for healthcare research, having the largest per capita funding in second and the third quartiles (p=0.03 and p=0.02).\n\nThe uneven allocation of healthcare research funds across EU countries was influenced by GDP per capita, medical research excellence and population size. Wealthier countries with an average population size and strong research excellence in healthcare had more EU funding for healthcare research. Higher disease burden apparently was not associated with more EU research funding."

E.",Mark  Rishniw,2018-10-30,scientific communication and education,"BACKGROUNDPublication speeds of clinically relevant veterinary journals have not been evaluated.\n\nMETHODSWe compared 23 prominent veterinary journals to 11 comparable medical and 4 high-impact science journals and examined select factors that might affect these speeds. Submission date, acceptance date and first online publication date were recorded for 50 sequentially identified research articles from each journal that had been published immediately prior to April 26, 2018. Intervals from submission to acceptance, acceptance to publication, and submission to publication were calculated in days for each article. Data were compared visually across all journals, and statistically by field (veterinary, medical, high-impact), by impact factor and by publisher (commercial vs society) to identify trends or differences in publication intervals.\n\nRESULTSWhen assessed by field, intervals from submission to acceptance (p=0.18), acceptance to publication (p=0.75) and submission to publication (p=0.13) did not differ. Individual journals varied slightly in intervals from submission to acceptance, but varied markedly in intervals from acceptance to publication. Three journals had median intervals from acceptance to publication exceeding 135 days and two exceeding 500 days. Three journals had median intervals from submission to publication exceeding 550 days. Neither impact factor nor publication model affected any intervals. Intervals from submission to acceptance and acceptance to publication were positively associated with overall interval from submission to publication (rho=0.7, P<0.0001 for both associations).\n\nCONCLUSIONSIntervals from submission to acceptance for veterinary journals are like those for medical and high-impact journals, suggesting that the review process is similar across fields. However, several veterinary journals have intervals from acceptance to publication approaching 18 months."

However, this collective action is precluded by the  consensus gap between scientific knowledge and public opinion. A growing body of evidence suggests that facts do not persuade people to act. Instead, it is visualization - the ability to simulate relatable scenarios - is the most effective approach for motivating behavior change. Here, we exemplify this approach, using current climate projections to enable people to visualize cities of the future, rather than describing intangible climate variables. Analyzing city pairs for 520 major cities of the world, we characterize which cities will most closely resemble the climate conditions of which other major cities by 2050. On average, most cities will resemble cities that are over 1000km south, and 22% of cities will experience climate conditions that are not currently experienced by any existing major cities. We predict that Londons climate in 2050 will resemble Barcelonas climate today, Madrid will resemble to Marrakesh, Moscow to Sofia, Seattle to San Francisco, Stockholm to Budapest, Tokyo to Changsha, etc. Our approach illustrates how complex climate data can be packaged to provide tangible information. By allowing people to visualize their own climate futures, we hope to empower citizens, policy makers and scientists to visualize expected climate impacts and adapt decision making accordingly."

Walker,2018-11-02,scientific communication and education,"Several high profile editorials and articles have advocated replacing the ubiquitous, but not especially informative, bar plot with dot plots or box plots which show the data or some summary of the data distribution. I argue that the biggest deficiency of bar plots (and other mean-and-error plots) is that they fail to directly communicate modeled effects and uncertainty, and dot and box plots do not address this deficiency. A Harrell plot combines a forest plot of modeled treatment effects and uncertainty, a dot plot of raw data, and a box plot of the distribution of the raw data into a single, two-part graph. A Harrell plot encourages best practices such as communication of the distribution of the data and a focus on effect size and uncertainty, while discouraging poor practices such as hiding distributions and focusing on p-values."

L.; Shirley, E.",Meredith  L  Gore,2018-11-12,scientific communication and education,"Natural resource rules exist to manage resources and the people that interact with them. These rules often fail because people do not comply with them. Decisions to comply with natural resource rules often are based on attitudes about legitimacy of rules and the perceived risks of breaking rules. Trust in agencies promulgating rules in part may determine perceptions of legitimacy of the rule, and in turn depends on individuals trust in different agency actors. The purpose of this research was to explore the relationship between fishing rule noncompliance and trust in scientists, a key group within management agencies. We interviewed 41 individuals in one rural fishing community in the Brazilian Pantanal from April to August, 2016, to assess (1) noncompliance rates, (2) noncompliance-related attitudes, and (3) the relationship between trust in scientists and noncompliance decisions in the region. We found that among study participants, noncompliance was common and overt. Trust in scientists performing research in the region was the best predictor of noncompliance rate with a fishing rule (nonparametric rank correlation{rho} = -0.717; Probit model pseudo-R2 = 0.241). Baseline data from this research may help inform future interventions to minimize IUU fishing and protect the Pantanal fishery. Although our results are specific to one community in the Pantanal, trust in scientists is potentially an important factor for compliance decisions in similar situations around the world. These results build not only on compliance theory but also speak to the important role that many scientists play in the geographic areas in which they conduct their research."

To access graduate education, undergraduate students must first gain exposure to a particular subject and subsequently accumulate related coursework and research experience. Many underrepresented students lack exposure to developmental biology due to limited undergraduate course offerings and finite resources at smaller institutions. To address this disparity, a group of University of Michigan graduate students and postdoctoral fellows created a portable short course focusing on developmental biology, titled \""Developing Future Biologists\"" (DFB). This weeklong educational initiative provides hands-on laboratory sessions, interactive lectures, and professional development workshops to teach students about developmental biology and increase awareness of scientific career options. To evaluate course effectiveness, we developed a pre-post assessment, incorporating main ideas from the BioCore Guide. Student understanding of basic concepts and perceived experience in developmental biology increased in DFB participants, despite the abbreviated nature of the course. Here, we provide all course materials and an in-depth analysis of the assessment we created. The DFB portable short course model is an easily adaptable tool that connects undergraduate students with opportunities for advanced study and lowers barriers for underrepresented students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics."

The proportion of timely disseminated trial results can inform alternative national and international benchmarking of university medical centers (UMCs).\n\nStudy Design and SettingFor all German UMCs we tracked all registered trials completed between 2009 and 2013. The results and an interactive website benchmark German UMCs regarding their performance in results dissemination.\n\nResultsWe identified and tracked 2,132 clinical trials. For 1,509 trials, one of the German UMCs took the academic lead. Of these 1,509 \""lead trials\"", 39% published their results (mostly via journal publications) in a timely manner (<24 months after completion). More than six years after study completion, 26% of all eligible lead trials still had not disseminated results.\n\nConclusionDespite substantial attention from many stakeholders to the topic, there is still a strong delay or even absence of results dissemination for many trials. German UMCs have several opportunities to improve this situation. Further research should evaluate whether and how a transparent benchmarking of UMC performance in results dissemination helps to increase value and reduce waste in medical research."

However, the number of protocols published in scientific journals (924) or in both PROSPERO and journals (807) has progressively increased over the last three years. Syst Rev and BMJ Open published more than half of the total protocols. While most productive countries were involved in  unique and  collaborative protocols, less productive countries only participated in  collaborative protocols that were mainly published only in PROSPERO. Our results suggest that although most countries were involved in producing in solitary protocols of non-Cochrane SRs during the study period, it would be desirable to develop new strategies to promote international collaborations, especially with less productive countries."

Therefore, the present study aims to develop a questionnaire for sense of values, called the Brief Personal Values Inventory (BPVI), consisting of simple questions and a smaller number of items compared to the PVQ. We first created 12 items for the BPVI and then tested their validity and reliability in 167 Japanese general population (81 males, mean age (SD) [range]: 23.4 (8.2) [15-57] years). Each of these items was correlated with one or more values in the PVQ-57. The BPVI items covered all higher-order values in Schwartzs theory (Openness to Change, Self-Enhancement, Conservation, and Self-Transcendence). In sum, the BPVI has an acceptable criterion-related validity and corresponds to higher-order values in Schwartzs value theory. The BPVI is suitable for a reliable and direct comparison of sense of values between children and adults, which may be useful for elucidating the developmental pathway of personal sense of values."

As a result, we now have a better idea of the current state of gender disparity in science, which remains widespread worldwide. However, fewer studies and limited data have restricted our understanding of this phenomenon in the Neotropics, a highly important region in terms of cultural and biological diversity. Despite a civil war that lasted more than five decades and produced eight million victims (half of them women), Colombia is the fifth country with the highest scientific production in Latin America and the Caribbean, as well as the second most biodiverse country in the world. In order to evaluate the status of gender parity in science in Colombia throughout the 21st century, data of science demographics was gathered covering the 2000-2017 time period. Percentage of women in science was decomposed by research area, researcher rank level and education level. Gender disparity was also estimated for changes in average age, access to scholarships for postgraduate studies, and number of doctoral graduates. Finally, using logistic function modelling, temporal projections into the future were performed, in order to estimate how long could it take to reach gender parity. Of six research fields, medical and health science is the only one to have reached gender parity (55.99%), although it is also the only one showing a steady decrease in women representation across time. On the other hand, engineering, humanities and natural sciences had the lowest percentages of female representation (19.89%, 30.02%, and 30.21%, respectively). Female researchers were on average younger than male researchers, and they also showed a decreasing presence as they move upward to more senior levels, exemplifying the  leaky-pipeline phenomenon common in science. More men were observed both as scholarship awardees for doctoral studies, and as doctoral graduates, indicating that obtaining a doctoral degree could be a major limiting factor for women in science. Possible drivers of these results are analysed, suggesting that a combination of lack of research funding, insufficient legal framework, pre-existing biases, and poor protection of womens rights inhibits female participation in science. Based on logistic function modelling it is estimated that, without any action to change current trends, it could take between 10 (humanities) and 175 (engineering) years to reach gender parity across all research areas."

R.",Stephen A Gallo,2018-11-28,scientific communication and education,"Scientific peer reviewers play an integral role in the grant selection process, yet very little has been reported on the levels of participation or the motivations of scientists to take part in peer review. AIBS developed a comprehensive peer review survey that examined the motivations and levels of participation of grant reviewers. The survey was disseminated to 13,091 scientists in AIBSs proprietary database. Of the 874 respondents, 76% indicated they had reviewed grant applications in the last 3 years; however, the number of reviews was unevenly distributed across this sample. Higher review loads were associated with respondents who had submitted more grant proposals over this time period, some of whom were likely to be study section members for large funding agencies. The most prevalent reason to participate in a review was to give back to the scientific community (especially among frequent grant submitters) and the most common reason to decline an invitation to review was lack of time. Interestingly, few suggested that expectation from the funding agency was a motivation to review. Most felt that review participation positively influenced their careers through improving grantsmanship and exposure to new scientific ideas. Of those who reviewed, respondents reported dedicating 2-5% of their total annual work time to grant review and, based on their self-reported maximum review loads, it is estimated they are participating at 56%-89% of their capacity, which may have important implications regarding the sustainability of the system. Overall, it is clear that participation in peer review is uneven and in some cases near capacity, and more needs to be done to create new motivations and incentives to increase the future pool of reviewers."

Teenage pregnancy is highly associated with abortions, infant and maternal mortality, high rate of unemployment, school failure and drop-outs and limited future career opportunities. This paper identifies and explains the factors influencing teenage pregnancy in Uganda Lake Victoria Island shoreline area and mountain districts.\n\nMethodsThe analysis focused on 405 girls aged 15-19 years, generated from the 2016 Uganda demographic and Health Survey. Odds ratios with 95% confidence interval and p-values were computed using appropriate logistic regression models to determine the presence and strength of associations between the teenage pregnancy and independent variables.\n\nResultsAge, residence, secondary or higher education level, female-headed households, marital status (married), occupation, wealth index(rich quintile), and knowledge of ovulation cycle were found to have statistically significant associations with teenage pregnancy.\n\nConclusionIncreased age, rural residence, occupation(not working), and knowledge of ovulation cycle were statistically significant predisposing factors of teenage pregnancy in Uganda Lake Victoria Island shoreline area and mountain districts. Teenagers in these study areas should be provided with sexual education as well as teenage-friendly health services at health facilities that include a wide range of options, as well as medically accurate counselling and information could mitigate teenage pregnancy."

This often leads to musculoskeletal pain and influences quality of life and cardiopulmonary function, which can be acute or chronic, localized or widespread. The study aimed to assess the serum level of lead and relate it to musculoskeletal pains, quality of life and cardiopulmonary functions of welders in Enugu metropolis, Southeast, Nigeria. Snowball sampling technique was adopted to reach over 100 welders working and residing in Enugu metropolis and who met the inclusion criteria for their informed consent to participate in the study. The first 100 to give the consent were selected for the study. results showed that the mean serum level of lead in welders in Enugu metropolis was 0.522{micro}g/dl with a range of 0.06-1.26 {micro}g/dl. Low back pain was prevalent among welders. The welders had a very high quality of life for the domain of physical health with a score of 94, and high psychosocial and social relationship domains for quality of life with the scores of 69 and 75 respectively. The welders perceived their quality of life as regards environment as average, as they reported their physical environment as being a little or moderately safe, having little money to meet their needs, moderate; availability to information needed for their day to day life, satisfaction with access to health services and time for leisure activities, and a majority reported being satisfied and/or slightly satisfied with their transportation. About 64.2% of the welders had an elevated systolic blood pressure above 120mmHg and 52.6% had diastolic blood pressure elevated above 80mmHg, while only 3.2% of the welders had pulse rates above 100 beats per minute. The mean values for lung function reported for the study were FVC = 1.43, FEV1 = 1.13 and PEF = 1.61. The significant relationship between serum lead levels (FVC, FEV1 and PEF) could be attributed to inhalation. The significant relationship between serum lead levels and low back pain and knee pain could be attributed to leads effect on the musculoskeletal system."

Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data from the questionnaire survey and a deductive approach with directed content analysis was used for the data from the interviews.\n\nResultsNurses perceived to have a dominant role in physical activity promotion of older patients during hospitalization. Ninety percent of the nurses stated to be responsible for physical activity promotion and 32 percent stated to be satisfied with the actual level of physical activity of their patients. Influencing factors were low patient motivation, high workload causing priority shifts of tasks and the role of physicians.\n\nConclusionAlthough their perceived dominant role in physical activity promotion, nurses identified a number of barriers interfering with actual level of physical activity. Improvement strategies should involve physicians, patients and carers."

E.; Shibuya, K.",Cherri  Zhang,2018-12-03,scientific communication and education,"Ghana has made significant stride towards universal health coverage (UHC) by implementing the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) in 2003. This paper investigates the progress of UHC indicators in Ghana from 1995 to 2030 and makes future predictions up to 2030 to assess the probability of achieving UHC targets. National representative surveys of Ghana were used to assess health service coverage and financial risk protection. The analysis estimated the coverage of 13 prevention and four treatment service indicators at the national level and across wealth quintiles. In addition, this analysis calculated catastrophic health payments and impoverishment to assess financial hardship and used a Bayesian regression model to estimate trends and future projections as well as the probabilities of achieving UHC targets by 2030. Wealth-based inequalities and regional disparities were also assessed. At the national level, 14 out of the 17 health service indicators are projected to reach the target of 80% coverage by 2030. Across wealth quintiles, inequalities were observed amongst most indicators with richer groups obtaining more coverage than their poorer counterparts. Subnational analysis revealed while all regions will achieve the 80% coverage target with high probabilities for prevention services, the same cannot be applied to treatment services. In 2015, the proportion of households that suffered catastrophic health payments and impoverishment at a threshold of 25% non-food expenditure were 1.9% (95%CrI: 0.9-3.5) and 0.4% (95%CrI: 0.2-0.8), respectively. These are projected to reduce to less than 0.5% by 2030. Inequality measures and subnational assessment revealed that catastrophic expenditure experienced by wealth quintiles and regions are not equal. Significant improvements were seen in both health service coverage and financial risk protection as a result of NHIS. However, inequalities across wealth quintiles and at the subnational level continue to be cause of concerns. Further efforts are needed to narrow these inequality gaps."
10.1101/486217,Cross-Lagged Panel Model in Medical Research: A Cautionary Note,"Usami, S.; Todo, N.; Murayama, K.",Satoshi  Usami,2018-12-03,scientific communication and education,"Longitudinal designs provide a strong inferential basis for uncovering reciprocal effects or causality between variables. For this analytic purpose, a cross-lagged panel model (CLPM) has been widely used in medical research, but the use of the CLPM has recently been criticized in methodological literature because parameter estimates in the CLPM conflate between-person and within-person processes. The aim of this study is to present some alternative models of the CLPM that can be used to examine reciprocal effects, and to illustrate potential consequences of ignoring the issue. A literature search, case studies, and simulation studies are used for this. We examined more than 300 medical papers published since 2009 that applied cross-lagged longitudinal models, finding that in all studies only a single model (typically, the CLPM) was performed and potential alternative models were not considered to test reciprocal effects. In 49% of the studies, only two time points were used, which makes it impossible to test such alternative models. Case studies and simulation studies showed that the CLPM often has worse model fit and markedly different estimates of cross-lagged parameters than alternative models, suggesting that research that relies on the CLPM only may draw erroneous conclusions regarding the presence, predominance, and sign of reciprocal effects as well as about causality."
10.1101/486209,Which author is which? Gender Authorship Position in Aquaculture Literature,"Chow, M.; Egna, H.; West, J.",Morgan  Chow,2018-12-03,scientific communication and education,"Examining authorship position in aquaculture facilitates an improved understanding of status of women in the discipline, as authorship is a critical factor in professional success. In a review of more than eight million papers in the JSTOR Corpus across disciplines, West et al. 2013 found that men predominate in the first and last author positions and women are underrepresented in single-authored papers. Other studies have assessed women authorship, and found that a gender gap in published literature persists. This study applies the large sample size and methodology of West et al. 2013 to the broad discipline of aquaculture, and compares these results to gender authorship in the International Aquaculture Curated Database (IACD) - a compilation of 543 peer-reviewed publications supported by four international aquaculture programs headquartered at Oregon State University -- and two curated databases in the JSTOR in the Web of Science.\n\nResults reveal that the percentage of women authors (13.8%) was similar for the JSTOR aquaculture subsample and the IACD (15.7%), yet significantly lower for that of the Web of Science database (3.7%). Women are not well represented any of the databases, and remain underrepresented as authors in any position in aquaculture journals. To contextualize our findings, we examined the number of women graduates in agricultural, biological, natural, and social sciences who earned degrees in the U.S. from 1991-2015. Results from the U.S. Department of Educations National Center for Education Statistics and the percent of female graduates in the IACD show that the percent of women graduates each year has increased with women representing more than 50% of graduates, providing contextualization for the proportion of women in the discipline. Learning how authorship has changed in the aquaculture discipline over the recent decades is critical for promoting gender equity for future aquaculture scholarship and the sustainability of the professional discipline."

This study evaluates two aspects of the selection process of the top-ranked applicants to the EMBO Long-Term Fellowship program in 2007. First, the accuracy of the system is evaluated by comparing the level of career progression of the candidates in 2017 with the original award decisions made in 2007. The second aspect, explores the relationship of career progression with indicators derived from the information available to evaluators at the time of application. The results obtained suggest that the peer review system is not substantially better than random selection in identifying the best candidates once an initial pre-selection of the most promising ones is performed. Not only that, the analysis of the indicators studied, some of which have not been analyzed in detail in the past, suggests that among other potential sources of uncertainty, the information available at the time of application is not sufficiently predictive of career progression. As previously described, however, we find clear differences in career progression between men and women. We propose a new mixed model of fellowship evaluation in which peer review is used to select high quality applications, and random allocation of funds is subsequently used to award fellowships among these top ranked candidates."

Recent studies explored this urging problem in several biomedical disciplines. In the present study, we identified 69 potential predatory (pseudo) pathology journals that were contrasted to 89 legitimate pathology journals obtained from the major bibliographic databases. All potential predatory journals in pathology shared at least one of the features proposed by previous studies (e.g. a poor web-site integrity, submissions via email, unclear or ambiguous peer-review process, missing names of the editorial board members, missing or pending the journal ISSN). Twenty-one (30%) of the potential predatory pathology journals had misleading titles mimicking those of legitimate journals. Only one of the identified journals was listed in the Directory of Open Access journals whereas none (0%) was indexed in PubMed/MEDLINE or Web of Science, listed in the Committee on Publication Ethics nor have they had a legitimate impact factor in the Journal Citation Reports."

The search approach used to identify synthetic biology publications identifies a core set of synthetic biology papers, extracts and refines keywords from these core records, searches for additional papers using those keywords, and supplements with articles published in dedicated synthetic biology journals and curated synthetic biology special collections. For the period from 2000 through to mid-July 2018, 11,369 synthetic biology publication records are identified worldwide. For patents, the search approach uses the same keywords as for publications then identifies further patents using a citation-tree search algorithm. The search covered patents by priority year from 2003 to early August 2018. Following geographical matching, 8,460 synthetic biology basic patent records were identified worldwide. Using this data, analyses of publications are presented which look at the growth of synthetic biology outputs, top countries and leading organizations, international co-authoring, leading subject categories, citations, synthetic biology on the map of science, and funding sponsorship. For patents, the analysis examines growth in patenting, national variations in publications compared with patenting, leading patent assignees, and the positioning of synthetic biology on a visualized map of patents."

We also surveyed life science PhD and postdoctoral trainees to assess their engagement in career preparation activities. PhD professionals employed in non-academic sectors had engaged in various career preparation activities during their training. Some activities had a higher perceived impact on the path to employment than others. Trainees had also engaged in such activities, but those rated by professionals as having a highly positive impact on their path to employment were engaged in by only a minority of trainees. The proportion of trainees who wished to work in a non-academic sector was higher among those who were closer to program completion. Like professionals, many trainees reported facing barriers to pursuing career development activities. Our findings suggest that PhD trainees seeking to work in non-academic sectors should engage in career preparation activities, particularly those that involve experiential learning. By supporting co-curricular programming and reducing barriers to participation in career development activities, academic administrators and faculty have the opportunity to support trainees professional development beyond the laboratory."

Access of services is high across a broad Benefits Package with no parallel enrolment necessary for any type of service at the point of access. Nonetheless, there is evidence of difficulty in acquiring and use of the NHIS card to access health care services.\n\nObjectiveWhile studies had been conducted into general awareness, there was no linkage between awareness, uptake and experiences with registration and use of the card. This study fills this gap.\n\nMethodsThis is a descriptive study. A mix of qualitative (39 Focus Group Discussions) and quantitative (625 household interviews) methods were used to collect the data. Qualitative data was analysed manually using a thematic approach while a frequency analysis was done for the quantitative data.\n\nResultsKnowledge about the Scheme was near universal. Enrolment was lower among FGD discussants, 38.7% had valid cards, than for household respondents, 62.9% valid cards. While mixed experiences with the registration process was observed among FGD discussants, 74% of the households ranked attitudes of Scheme staff as positive. The study found the NHIS card facilitates access to facility based health care. Satisfaction levels with use of the card were mixed and contextual among discussants. However, 90% of households reported their cards were readily accepted at health facilities. Expired card (51.4%) and health facility had stopped accepting NHIS cards (14.3%) were mentioned as reasons for non-acceptance.\n\nConclusionPeoples experience during registration and use of the NHIS card to access health care has lasting effect on their perceptions of the Scheme. This can be harnessed to manage the high expectations, grow membership, discourage frivolous use and address artificial barriers of access."

This study uses qualitative methods to explore Australian eyecare professionals perspective on barriers to effective AMD care. Seven focus groups involving 65 optometrists were conducted by an experienced facilitator. A nominal group technique was used to identify, prioritize and semi-quantify barriers and enablers to AMD care. Participants individually ranked their perceived top five barriers and enablers with the most important granted a score of 5 and the least important a score of 1. For each barrier or enabler, the number of votes it received and its total score were recorded. Barriers and enablers selected by at least one participant in their top 5 were then qualitatively analysed, grouped using thematic analysis and total score calculated for each consolidated barrier or enabler. In-depth individual interviews were conducted with 10 ophthalmologists and 2 optometrists. Contributions were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed with NVivo software. One hundred and sixty-nine barriers and 51 enablers to AMD care were identified in the focus groups. Of these, 102 barriers and 42 enablers were selected as one of their top 5 by at least one participant and further consolidated into 16 barriers and 10 enablers after thematic analysis. Factors impacting AMD care identified through analysis of the transcripts were coded to three categories of influence: patient-centered, practitioner-centered, and structural factors. Eyecare professionals considered poor care pathways, people with AMDs poor disease understanding / denial, and cost of care / lack of funding, as the most significant barriers to AMD care; they considered shared care model, access, and communication as the most significant enablers to good AMD care. These findings suggest that Australian eyecare professionals perceive that there is a need for improved patient support systems and appropriately funded, clearer care pathway to benefit people with AMD."

A mental model interview of 28 individuals who discussed pandemic influenza was analyzed in this paper. The interviewees were college students in Beijing, China who were evaluated to understand their views on the risk perception of pandemic influenza. Referring to the mental model theory, the researchers using Delphi method to identify the key risk factors and concepts to examine the public understanding of these contents; then, the researchers identify the deviations in their understanding so that suggestions and countermeasures have been put forward to enhance the effectiveness of risk communication. Most of the conceptual content was mentioned by most interviewees. However, some interviewees showed misunderstanding including excessive optimism about the consequences of pandemic influenza, a lack of detailed mitigation measures, and negative attitudes toward health education and vaccination. Once faced with threats, this may lead to the failure of risk communication. In Beijing City, the center of domestic and international education, the historical SARS epidemic and this years seasonal flu peak are all hints of the potential risk of a pandemic outbreak. Beijings college students one-sided understanding and misunderstanding of the relevant risk information may increase the risk during an influenza pandemic. The results highlight the necessity for the government to clearly focus on the communication content of the student group, provide an official reference plan for the public and update health education on this topic."

W.",Wyeth W Wasserman,2018-12-07,scientific communication and education,"Researchers in the life sciences are increasingly faced with the task of obtaining compute resources and training to analyze large, high-throughput technology generated datasets. As demand for compute resources has grown, high performance computing (HPC) systems have been implemented by research organizations and international consortiums to support academic researchers. However, life science researchers lack effective time-of-need training resources for utilization of these systems. Current training options have drawbacks that inhibit the effective training of researchers without experience in computational analysis. We identified the need for flexible, centrally-organized, easily accessible, interactive, and compute resource specific training for academic HPC use. In our delivery of a modular workshop series, we provided foundational training to a group of researchers in a coordinated manner, allowing them to further pursue additional training and analysis on compute resources available to them. Efficacy measures indicate that the material was effectively delivered to a broad audience in a short time period, including both virtual and on-site students. The practical approach to catalyze academic HPC use is amenable to diverse systems worldwide."

V.; Rozylowicz, L.",Andreea  Nita,2018-12-08,scientific communication and education,"Farming landscapes of Europe are vital arenas for social-ecological sustainability because of their significant coverage and potential to integrate food production with biodiversity conservation. Knowledge gathered by scientific research is a critical ingredient for developing and implementing socio-economically and ecologically sustainable grassland management strategies for grasslands. The quality of scientific knowledge and its potential to address grasslands as complex social-ecological systems is strongly dependent on the creativity and scientific ambition of the researcher, but also on the network (from academic and non-academic sectors) around the researcher. The goal of this paper is to map the research network around Romanias grasslands. These systems have exceptional socio-cultural and economic values and are between the most biodiverse ecosystems of the world. Considering the multiple threats to these grasslands, it is an urgent need to understand the existing scientific knowledge profile around these systems. This paper aims at using bibliometrics analysis, a well-developed scientific domain that envisages network theory to analyze relationships between affiliations network, co-authorship network, and co-word analysis. The number of studies targeting grassland management in Romania is increasing mainly thanks to international involvement. However, the management of the grasslands is still deficient and the contribution of science to the process is virtually absent. The subject of research is mainly related to the biological and ecological characteristics of grasslands, a notable absence from internationally visible research being the management of grasslands, especially in the context of EU Common Agricultural Policies. To increase scientific performance, and better inform EU and local policies on grassland management, Romanian researchers should better capitalize on international collaborations and local academic leaders. Our findings can be used to identify research gaps and to improve collaboration and knowledge exchange between practitioners, scientists, policy makers, and stakeholders."

Using kidney biopsies obtained at time of donation to evaluate single or double allocation based on Karpinski score, we determined the prevalence of histological lesions attributable to diabetes.\n\nAll 42 donors presented with normoalbuminuria and an estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (CKD-EPI) > 60 ml/min/1.73m2. Of the 36 patients with available kidney biopsy, one was non interpretable and 32 had histopathological lesions consistent with diabetic kidney disease and encompassing all histological classes.\n\nThus, we found a relatively high proportion of histologically proven diabetic kidney disease that was clinically undiagnosed as none of the patient had significant albuminuria and eGFR <60 cc/min/1.73 m2. Our data support the need to implement routine kidney biopsies in normoalbuminuric diabetic subjects in early stages of Chronic Kidney Disease. As others have shown that histological lesions associated with diabetic kidney disease predict disease progression, such strategy may help to risk stratify patients and may guide therapeutic decisions at early disease stages."
10.1101/496927,Using a diabetes discussion forum and Wikipedia to detect the alignment of public interests and the research literature,"Didegah, F.; Ghaseminik, Z.; Alperin, J. P.",Juan  Pablo  Alperin,2018-12-14,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundDiabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. It is therefore unsurprising that there is a high volume of public discussions, resources, and research tackling various aspects of the disease. Over the last decade, more than hundred thousand research articles have been published by researchers and countless of online discussions have taken place on various online platforms. This study is an attempt to identify the areas of public interest, related to diabetes, by looking at online discussion forums and to evaluate their relationship to pages about diabetes found on Wikipedia and to the academic research about the topic. The main aim is to investigate the extent to which researchers are responding to the publics interests and concerns, and to the level of uptake of the research topics in the public sphere.\n\nMethodology/Principal findingsTo detect public interests and concerns in diabetes, we collected posts on a popular diabetes discussion forum (DiabeticConnect) and pages (articles) about diabetes published in Wikipedia. We also downloaded the titles and abstracts of research articles about diabetes from the Scopus database, all between 2008 and 2016. Tags assigned to each post in the discussion forum were used along with the post itself to compute a Labeled Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LLDA) model, which was then used to classify the Wikipedia pages and research articles. The resulting classifications were then used to compare the prevalence of the topics found in the discussion forum with those of the other two sources. The results show that while research articles and Wikipedia pages about diabetes focus on diabetes testing, treatments, and disease control, the public forum discussions focus on Type 2 diabetes, emotional support, and proper diet for diabetic patients. However, for some other topics there was an alignment in the relative rise and fall of interest across the three platforms.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceThe alignment and misalignment in the changes of relative interest over the various topics is evidence that the LLDA modelling can be useful for comparing a public corpus, like a diabetes forum, and an academic one, like research titles and abstracts. The success of using LLDA to classify research articles based on the tags assigned to posts in a public discussion forum shows that this a promising method for better understanding how the scientific community responds to public interests and needs, and, on the flip side, how the public takes up the language and topics discussed by the academic community."
10.1101/495465,The Case For and Against Double-blind Reviews,"Cox, A. R.; Montgomerie, R.",Robert  Montgomerie,2018-12-16,scientific communication and education,"To date, the majority of authors on scientific publications have been men. While much of this gender bias can be explained by historic sexism and discrimination, there is concern that women may still be disadvantaged by the peer review process if reviewers unconscious biases lead them to reject publications with female authors more often. One potential solution to this perceived gender bias in the reviewing process is for journals to adopt double-blind reviews whereby neither the authors nor the reviewers are aware of each others identities and genders. To test the efficacy of double-blind reviews, we assigned gender to every authorship of every paper published in 5 different journals with different peer review processes (double-blind vs. single blind) and subject matter (birds vs. behavioral ecology) from 2010-2018 (n = 4865 papers). While female authorships comprised only 35% of the total, the double-blind journal Behavioral Ecology did not have more female authorships than its single-blind counterparts. Interestingly, the incidence of female authorship is higher at behavioral ecology journals (Behavioral Ecology and Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology) than in the ornithology journals (Auk, Condor, Ibis), for papers on all topics as well as those on birds. These analyses suggest that double-blind review does not currently increase the incidence of female authorship in the journals studied here. We conclude, at least for these journals, that double-blind review does not benefit female authors and may, in the long run, be detrimental."

A.; Fischer, M.; Timmers, I.; Simons, L. E.",Lauren C Heathcote,2018-12-17,scientific communication and education,"ObjectivesThe Internet in general, and YouTube in particular, is now one of the most popular sources of health-related information. Pain neuroscience education has become a primary tool for managing persistent pain, based in part on the discovery that information about pain can change pain. Our objective was to examine the availability, characteristics, and content of YouTube videos providing pain neuroscience education.\n\nMethodsWe conducted a systematic review of videos on YouTube using the search terms \""pain education\"", \""what is pain\"", and \""pain brain\"" in January 2018. Videos were included if they were in English, were under 10 minutes long, and included information on the neuroscience of pain. Videos were coded for i) descriptive characteristics (e.g., number of views, duration on YouTube), ii) source and style, iii) whether or not they addressed seven pre-determined target concepts of pain neuroscience education (e.g.,  Pain is not an accurate marker of tissue state), and iv) how engaging they were.\n\nResultsWe found 106 unique videos that met the inclusion criteria. The videos ranged from having four views to over five million views (Mdn = 1163 views), with the three most highly viewed videos accounting for 75% of the total views. Animated videos were much more highly viewed than non-animated videos. Only a small number of videos had been posted by a clearly-identifiable reputable source such as an academic or medical research institution (10%), although a number of videos were posted by healthcare professionals and professional medical societies. For a small number of videos (7%), the source was unclear. We found 17 videos that addressed at least one target concept of pain neuroscience science education, only nine of which were considered to be engaging. The target concept  Pain is a brain output was considered to be well addressed by the most videos (N = 11), followed by  Pain is a protector (N = 10). We found only one video that adequately addressed all seven target concepts of pain neuroscience education.\n\nDiscussionYouTube contains a variety of videos that practitioners, patients, and families may view to access pain neuroscience education information. A small portion of these videos addressed one or more target concepts of pain neuroscience education in an engaging manner. It is yet to be determined to what extent patients are able to learn information from these videos, to what extent the videos promote behavior change, and thus to what extent the videos may be useful for clinical practice."

The present research work emphases on the sol-gel technique to formulate the polymethyl methyl acrylate/polystyrene/silica composite membrane.\n\nMethodsThe characteristic of the composite was investigated through modern state art of instrumentation.\n\nResultsThe functional groups attached to the polymer was absorbed by FTIR. The FTIR spectrum confirm that the blend was mixed thoroughly and the formation of unite intimately between the polymers. The membranes were observed by SEM for its surface homogeneity which depends upon the composition of the two blending polymers. The captured SEM images showed the formation of microcracks on the surface, which was evidently controlled by varying the constituent polymer ratios. The prepared blend membranes with 2:1 ratio of PMMA/PS/Si displayed higher water uptake compared to other blended membranes. The composite membranes had good hydroxyl apatite growth in SBF solution. Furthermore, the in vitro cytotoxicity studies carried out by MTT method, using RAW macrophage cells showed that all the samples exhibited excellent cell viability.\n\nConclusionThe inflammatory response of composite with equal concentration of PMMA-PS were performed and observed no inflammation in comparison with control and other tested concentrations."

The study assessed the use of patient-initiated PN method using notification and referral slips and measured the level of acceptability of provider-initiated PN using short-message-service (SMS) to personal mobile phones of sexual partners.\n\nMethodsA quantitative survey using anonymous structured self-administered and researcher assisted questionnaires was conducted among minibus taxi drivers in the nine major taxi ranks in Gauteng province, South Africa.\n\nResultsThe sample consisted of 722 minibus taxi drivers with a mean age of 37.2 years old, 284 (59.5%) had multiple sexual partners, 368 (52.2%) did not use a condom during last sexual act, 286 (42.8%) reported inconsistent use of condoms, and 459 (65%) tested for HIV in the past 12 months. Majority (n=709, 98.2%) understood the importance of PN once diagnosed with STI, but would prefer delivering PN referral slip (n=670, 93.2%) over telling a partner face to face if they themselves were diagnosed with STI. Acceptability of provider-initiated PN using SMS was 452 (62.7%) and associated with history of HIV testing in the past year (OR=1.72, p=0.002, CI: 1.21-2.45). The perceived use of PN referral-slip from sexual partner to seek treatment was 91.8% (n=659). About a third (n=234, 32.5%) were not in favor of provider-initiated PN by SMS and preferred telling partners face to face.\n\nConclusionThere were contrasting findings on the acceptability and utilization of existing patient-initiated PN and the proposed PN using SMS from health providers. The preference of delivering PN referral slip to sexual partner over face-to-face PN renders communicating about STIs the responsibility of health providers. Therefore, they have an opportunity to provide patients with options to choose a PN method that is best suited to their relationships and circumstances and modify PN messages to encourage partners to use the different PN to prevent STIs."
10.1101/498931,Violating the normality assumption may be the lesser of two evils,"Knief, U.; Forstmeier, W.",Ulrich  Knief,2018-12-20,scientific communication and education,"When data are not normally distributed (e.g. skewed, zero-inflated, binomial, or count data) researchers are often uncertain whether it may be legitimate to use tests that assume Gaussian errors (e.g. regression, t-test, ANOVA, Gaussian mixed models), or whether one has to either model a more specific error structure or use randomization techniques.Here we use Monte Carlo simulations to explore the pros and cons of fitting Gaussian models to non-normal data in terms of risk of type I error, power and utility for parameter estimation.We find that Gaussian models are remarkably robust to non-normality over a wide range of conditions, meaning that P-values remain fairly reliable except for data with influential outliers judged at strict alpha levels. Gaussian models also perform well in terms of power and they can be useful for parameter estimation but usually not for extrapolation. Transformation of data before analysis is often advisable and visual inspection for outliers and heteroscedasticity is important for assessment. In strong contrast, some non-Gaussian models and randomization techniques bear a range of risks that are often insufficiently known. High rates of false-positive conclusions can arise for instance when overdispersion in count data is not controlled appropriately or when randomization procedures ignore existing non-independencies in the data.Overall, we argue that violating the normality assumption bears risks that are limited and manageable, while several more sophisticated approaches are relatively error prone and difficult to check during peer review. Hence, as long as scientists and reviewers are not fully aware of the risks, science might benefit from preferentially trusting Gaussian mixed models in which random effects account for non-independencies in the data in a transparent way.Tweetable abstract Gaussian models are remarkably robust to even dramatic violations of the normality assumption.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text"

C.",Obaro  Evuarherhe,2018-12-20,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundMany authors choose to work with professional medical writers when reporting the results of clinical trials. We conducted a systematic review to examine the relationship between professional medical writing support (PMWS) and the quality, ethics and timeliness of publications reporting clinical trials.\n\nMethodsUsing terms related to  medical writer and  observational study, we searched MEDLINE and Embase (no date limits), as well as abstracts and posters from meetings of the International Society for Medical Publication Professionals (ISMPP; 2014-2017). We also hand-searched the journals Medical Writing and The Write Stuff (2014-2017), and the bibliographies of studies identified in the electronic searches. We screened the results to identify studies that compared the quality, ethics and timeliness of clinical trial publications written with and without declared PMWS.\n\nResultsOur searches identified 97 potentially relevant studies, of which 89 were excluded during screening and full paper review. The remaining eight studies compared 849 publications with PMWS with 2073 articles developed without such support. In these eight studies, PMWS was shown to be associated with: increased adherence to Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines (in 3/3 studies in which this was assessed); publication in journals with an impact factor (one study); a higher quality of written English (one study); and a lower likelihood of reporting non-pre-specified outcomes (one study). PMWS was not associated with increased adherence to CONSORT for Abstracts guidelines (one study) or with the impact of published articles (mean number of citations per year, mean number of article views per year and Altmetric score; one study). In studies that assessed timeliness of publication, PMWS was associated with a reduced time from last patient visit in clinical trials to primary publication (one study), whereas time from submission to acceptance showed inconsistent results (two studies).\n\nConclusionsThis systematic review of eight observational studies suggests that PMWS increases the overall quality of reporting of clinical trials and may improve the timeliness of publication."

Wischusen,2018-12-22,scientific communication and education,"Despite many calls to reform undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education to incorporate active learning into classes, there has been little attention paid to graduate level classrooms or courses taught by graduate students. Here, we set out to understand if and how STEM graduate students perceptions of active learning change in the classes they take versus those they teach by administering surveys to STEM graduate students at our institution. We found that graduate students had taken relatively few graduate level classes using active learning and they felt that more time should devoted to active learning in the courses they were taking. Teaching assistants felt that they were devoting the right amount of class time to active learning in the classes they taught. Graduate students also felt that they were using teaching methods in the classes they taught that were different from those they thought should be used when teaching undergraduates and were different from how they preferred to learn when taking classes. These findings suggest that graduate students perceptions of teaching and learning changed based on their role in the classroom, which have implications for graduate level course work and professional development programs."

It can have wide-ranging physical, cognitive and psychosocial effects. Most people recover within weeks to months after the injury, but a substantial proportion are at risk of developing lasting post-concussion symptoms. The Rivermead Post-Concussion Syndrome Questionnaire (RPQ) is a short validated 16-items self-report instrument to evaluate post-concussive symptoms. The aim of this study was to test psychometrics characteristics of the current Dutch translation of the RPQ.\n\nMethodsTo determine the psychometric characteristics of the Dutch RPQ, 472 consecutive patients six months after they presented with a traumatic brain injury in seven medical centers in the Netherlands (N=397), and in two in Belgium (Flanders) (N=75) took part in the study which is part of the large prospective longitudinal observational CENTER-TBI-EU-study. Psychometric properties at six months post TBI, were assessed using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Sensitivity was analyzed by comparing RPQ scores of patients after mild vs. moderate and severe TBI.\n\nFindingsThe Dutch version of RPQ proved good, showing excellent psychometric characteristics: high internal consistency (Cronbachs  .93), and good construct validity, being sensitive to self-reported recovery status at six months post TBI. Moreover, data showed a good fit to the three dimensions structure of separate cognitive, emotional and somatic factors (Chi2=119; df=117; p=.4; CFI=.99; RMSEA=.006), reported earlier in the literature.\n\nDiscussionPsychometric characteristics of the Dutch version of RPQ proved excellent to good, and can the instrument therefore be applied for research purposes and in daily clinical practice."

M.; Kashima, Y.",Stephanie  Marie  Rizio,2018-12-22,scientific communication and education,"The relationship between economic conditions and environmental attitudes has been hotly debated in academic and public discourse. Some contend that economic prosperity strengthens environmental attitudes, while others argue that no such relationship exists. We shed light on the economy-environmental importance relationship by incorporating both nonlinear effects and public perceptions of the economy. Two countries with comparable economic performance and cultural heritage, Australia and Canada, are investigated. Using opinion survey data in a time-series analysis over a 20-year period, we find that GDP per capita has a nonlinear relationship with environmental attitudes in both countries, and the inclusion of perceptions of the economy significantly improves the prediction of environmental attitudes. In both Australia and Canada, a U-shaped relationship is observed; initial improvements in economic conditions tend to worsen environmental attitudes, but past a certain threshold, further economic improvements result in increased environmental concern. Perceptions of the economy too showed analogous trends. In both countries, positive perceptions of the economy were associated with strong environmental attitudes; at least in Canada, negative perceptions of the economy were also positively associated with environmental attitudes. The nonlinear effects of the economy as well as perceptions of the economy helps shed light on the current inconclusive literature on the relationship between the economy and citizens pro-environmental support. This is an important consideration given the critical importance to the future sustainability of the natural environment."

E.",Lauren May Hall,2018-12-29,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundRecently, there has been increasing concern about the replicability, or lack thereof, of published research. An especially high rate of false discoveries has been reported in some areas motivating the creation of resource-intensive collaborations to estimate the replication rate of published research by repeating a large number of studies. The substantial amount of resources required by these replication projects limits the number of studies that can be repeated and consequently the generalizability of the findings.\n\nMethods and findingsIn 2013, Jager and Leek developed a method to estimate the empirical false discovery rate from journal abstracts and applied their method to five high profile journals. Here, we use the relative efficiency of Jager and Leeks method to gather p-values from over 30,000 abstracts and to subsequently estimate the false discovery rate for 94 journals over a five-year time span. We model the empirical false discovery rate by journal subject area (cancer or general medicine), impact factor, and Open Access status. We find that the empirical false discovery rate is higher for cancer vs. general medicine journals (p = 5.14E-6). Within cancer journals, we find that this relationship is further modified by journal impact factor where a lower journal impact factor is associated with a higher empirical false discovery rates (p = 0.012, 95% CI: -0.010, -0.001). We find no significant differences, on average, in the false discovery rate for Open Access vs closed access journals (p = 0.256, 95% CI: -0.014, 0.051).\n\nConclusionsWe find evidence of a higher false discovery rate in cancer journals compared to general medicine journals, especially those with a lower journal impact factor. For cancer journals, a lower journal impact factor of one point is associated with a 0.006 increase in the empirical false discovery rate, on average. For a false discovery rate of 0.05, this would result in over a 10% increase to 0.056. Conversely, we find no significant evidence of a higher false discovery rate, on average, for Open Access vs. closed access journals from InCites. Our results provide identify areas of research that may need of additional scrutiny and support to facilitate replicable science. Given our publicly available R code and data, others can complete a broad assessment of the empirical false discovery rate across other subject areas and characteristics of published research."

Researchers in turn may choose to pursue research objectives based on what is believed to be most highly valued by their peers. By compiling a corpus of abstracts from within the field neuroscience, I was able to analyze which terms had differential frequencies between 12 high-impact and 13 medium-impact journals. Approximately 50,000 neuroscience abstracts were analyzed over the years 2014-2018. Several broad trends emerged from the analysis of which terms were biased towards high-impact journals. Generally speaking, high-impact journals tended to feature: genetic or psychiatric studies, use of the latest and most sophisticated methods, examinations of the orbitofrontal cortex or amygdala, and/or use of human or non-mammalian subjects. Medium-impact journals tended to feature motor or cardiovascular studies, use of older methods, examinations of caudal brain regions, and/or rats as subjects."

This research was intended to investigate the difficulty and discrimination indices, distracters efficiency, whole test reliability and construct defects in summative test for freshman common course at Gondar CTE. In this study, 176 exam papers were analyzed in terms of difficulty index, point bi-serial correlation and distracter efficiencies. Internal consistency reliability and construct defects such as meaningless stems, punctuation errors and inconsistencies in option formats were also investigated. Results revealed that the summative test as a whole has moderate difficulty level (0.56 {+/-} 0.20) and good distracter efficiency (85.71% {+/-} 29%). However, the exam was poor in terms of discrimination power (0.16 {+/-} 0.28) and internal consistency reliability (KR-20 = 0.58). Only one item has good discrimination power and one more item excellent in its discrimination. About 41.9% of the items were either too easy or too difficult. Inconsistency in option formats or inappropriate options, punctuation errors and meaningless stems were also observed. Thus, future test development interventions should give due emphasis on item reliability, discrimination coefficient and item construct defects."

H.; Oh, J.; Bae, J.; Lee, S.-Y.",So-Young  Lee,2019-01-09,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundPatients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) experience much more marked and earlier muscle wasting than subjects who do not have chronic illnesses. However, a few studies that have examined sarcopenia have been reported in CKD patients. We investigated the prevalence of sarcopenia in predialysis and dialysis outpatients with CKD and explored its relationship with the clinical outcomes.\n\nMeasurementsSarcopenia was defined as reduced muscle strength accompanied by decreased adjusted appendicular skeletal muscle (ASM), while those patients who exhibited only one of these characteristics were categorized as presarcopenic patients. ASM was measured by bioimpedence analysis, and muscle strength was evaluated by handgrips. ASM was adjusted by weight (ASM/wt). Patients were prospectively followed for up to 2 years.\n\nResultsOne hundred seventy-nine patients were recruited (114 male and 65 female patients who were classified into 103 predialysis patients and 76 dialysis patients, with 44.7% having diabetes). Their mean age was 60.6 {+/-} 13.5 years old. The prevalence of sarcopenia was 9.5%, while 55.9% of the patients were categorized as presarcopenic. The ASM/wt index showed significant correlations with age, handgrip strength, HOMA-IR and frailty scores. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models demonstrated that the risk of hospitalization was significantly higher for patients with presarcopenia [hazard ratio (HR), 2.48; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.180-5.230], and the risk of hospitalization was much higher for patients with sarcopenia than for patients in the nonsarcopenic group (HR, 9.11; 95% CI, 2.295-25.182)\n\nConclusionsSarcopenia and presarcopenia, which were defined using the ASM/wt index and handgrip strength, predicted a poorer, hospitalization-free survival in CKD patients"

Logistic regression was conducted to explore risk factors contributed to metal health.\n\nResultsA total of 1,950 questionnaires were delivered, and 1,864 were returned with a response rate of 95.6%. The prevalence of depression and anxiety were 24.1% and 28.9%. As for workload, the average number of beds in charge per month is 65.97{+/-}95.58 beds, among which internal medicine department and surgical department endure more workloads. Though workers in ER and ICU manage fewer beds, they bear the longest nonstop working length in the previous month (19.18{+/-}10.82 h). There were 78.0% had suffered WPV in the preceding year. Staffs in ER and ICU are at higher risk to physical violence, especially doctors. Regarding to sleep quality, only 9.2% participants reported that they sleep well. Logistic regression indicated that workplace violence and sleep quality were independent risk factors for both anxiety and depression.\n\nConclusionThe current study revealed the devastating conditions of mental disorders in medical workers and associated factors. Effective interventions are necessary to improve this situation."

M.; Martos Martinez, A.; Gazquez Linares, J. J.",María del Carmen  Pérez-Fuentes,2019-01-10,scientific communication and education,"Burnout syndrome is a phenomenon that is becoming ever more widespread, especially in workers who have heavy workloads and time pressures, such as nurses. Its progression has been shown to be related to both individual and work-related variables. The objective of this study was to examine the risk and protective roles played by work-related and personal variables, both sociodemographic and psychological, in the development of burnout in nurses. The sample was made up of 1236 nurses. Exploratory tests were performed to understand the relationships between burnout and the other variables, as well as a binary logistic regression to understand their roles in the incidence of this syndrome. Lastly, a regression tree was constructed. The results showed that the sociodemographic variables examined in the study were not related with levels of burnout in nurses. However, certain work-related variables were, such as spending more time with colleagues and patients, and reporting good quality relationships with colleagues, superiors, patients and their families, exhibiting a significant, negative relationship to the presence of burnout. Of the psychological variables, the stress factors conflict-social acceptance, and irritability-tension-fatigue, along with informative communication were found to be risk factors for the appearance of burnout in nurses, in contrast to the communication skills factor, empathy, and energy-joy, which exercised a protective function. The irritability-tension-fatigue factor was the best predictor for the appearance of burnout in nurses."

M.; Cheah, J.; Matzen, P.",Syed  Mohamed  Aljunid,2019-01-11,scientific communication and education,"ObjectiveThe main aim of this study is to identify the direct cost and economic burden of hypoglycaemia among patients with Type II diabetes mellitus in Malaysia.\n\nMethodsThe incurred cost for hypoglycaemia among patients admitted to University Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre (UKMMC) was explored from a cross sectional study. 20-79 year patients discharged between Jan 2010 to Sept 2015 and having an ICD-10 code of hypoglycaemia as a primary diagnosis in the casemix database were included in the study. Costing analysis from the perspective of health providers was completed using step-down approach. Data related to hospital cost were collected using hospital-costing template, based on three levels of cost centres. The costing data from UKMMC was used to estimate the national burden of hypoglycaemia among type II diabetics for the whole country.\n\nResultsOf 244 diabetes patients admitted primarily for hypoglycaemia to UKMMC, 52% were female and 88% were over 50 years old. The cost increased with severity. Managing a hypoglycaemic case requires 5 days (median) of inpatient stay with a range of 2-26 days; and costs RM 9,083 (USD 2,323). 30% of the cost came from the ward services cost (final cost centre), 16% of the cost came from ICU services and 15% from pharmacy services(secondarylevel cost centres). Based on the prevalence of hypoglycaemia-related admissions of 3.2%, the total cost of care for hypoglycaemia among adult diabetes in Malaysia is estimated to be RM 117.4 (USD 30.0) million, which is translated as 0.5% of Ministry of Health budget.\n\nConclusionHypoglycaemia imposes substantial economic impact even without the direct and indirect cost incurred by patients and other cost of complications. Proper diabetic care and health education is needed in diabetic management to reduce episodes of hypoglycaemia."

J.; Blekhman, R.",Ran  Blekhman,2019-01-13,scientific communication and education,"Researchers in the life sciences are posting their work to preprint servers at an unprecedented and increasing rate, sharing papers online before (or instead of) publication in peer-reviewed journals. Though the popularity and practical benefits of preprints are driving policy changes at journals and funding organizations, there is little bibliometric data available to measure trends in their usage. Here, we collected and analyzed data on all 37,648 preprints that were uploaded to bioRxiv.org, the largest biology-focused preprint server, in its first five years. We find that preprints on bioRxiv are being read more than ever before (1.1 million downloads in October 2018 alone) and that the rate of preprints being posted has increased to a recent high of more than 2,100 per month. We also find that two-thirds of bioRxiv preprints posted in 2016 or earlier were later published in peer-reviewed journals, and that the majority of published preprints appeared in a journal less than six months after being posted. We evaluate which journals have published the most preprints, and find that preprints with more downloads are likely to be published in journals with a higher impact factor. Lastly, we developed Rxivist.org, a website for downloading and interacting programmatically with indexed metadata on bioRxiv preprints."

M.; Penders, B.; Sheble, L.; Vermeulen, N.; Vision, T.",Edward J Hackett,2019-01-13,scientific communication and education,"Synthesis centers are a recently-developed form of scientific organization that catalyzes and supports a form of interdisciplinary research that integrates diverse theories, methods and data across spatial or temporal scales, scientific phenomena, and forms of expertise to increase the generality, parsimony, applicability, or empirical soundness of scientific explanations. Research has shown the synthesis working group to be a distinctive form of scientific collaboration that reliably produces consequential, high-impact publications, but no one has asked: do synthesis working groups produce publications that are substantially more diverse than those produced outside of synthesis centers, and if so, how and with what effects? We have investigated these questions through a novel textual analysis. We found that if diversity is measured solely by mean difference in the Rao-Stirling (aggregate) measure of diversity, then the answer is no. But synthesis center papers have significantly greater variety and balance, but significantly lower disparity, than papers in the reference corpus. Synthesis center influence is mediated by the greater size of synthesis center collaborations (numbers of authors, distinct institutions, and references) but even when taking size into account, there is a persistent direct effect: synthesis center papers have significantly greater variety and balance, but less disparity, than papers in the reference corpus. We conclude by inviting further exploration of what this novel textual analysis approach might reveal about interdisciplinary research and by offering some practical implications of our results."

N.; Mumah, S.",Lem N Ngongalah,2019-01-13,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundImproved capacity for research is a valuable and sustainable means of advancing health and development in Africa. Local leadership in research capacity strengthening is important for developing contextually appropriate programs that increase locally-driven research, and improve Africas ability to adapt and use scientific knowledge. This study provides an overview of African organisations that aim to strengthen research capacity in Africa, and the major initiatives or approaches being used for this purpose.\n\nMethodsA desk review of grey and published literature on research capacity strengthening in Africa was conducted, in addition to panel discussions on the determinants of research capacity in Africa. Data was analysed through thematic analysis and a framework developed by the Collaboration for Research Excellence in Africa (CORE Africa).\n\nResults11 organisations were identified, spread across South, Central, East and West Africa. The main approaches to improving research capacity were: providing opportunities for academic research and research training. Initiatives to provide research equipment, funding and facilitate research use for policy-making were limited; while strategies to increase research awareness, promote collaboration, and provide guidance and incentives for research were lacking. Most organisations had programs for researchers and academics, with none targeting funders or the general public.\n\nConclusionLocal leadership is essential for improving research capacity in Africa. In addition to providing adequate support to academics and researchers, initiatives that help revitalize the education system in Africa, promote collaboration and engage funders and the general public will be helpful for strengthening research capacity in Africa."

Its long-lasting life-like quality enables multiple applications in surgical training programs. The standard process of Thiel embalming, which involves perfusion of embalming fluid in fresh cadavers through cannulation of the arterial and venous systems could be difficult in some areas of the world where fresh body donation rates are low or banned. This study will assess the ability to Thiel embalm fresh frozen mice as an animal model as a solution for the lack of fresh cadavers. The ability of Thiel embalming frozen tissue would enable areas in the world where they do not have access to recently diseased donated cadavers. The study was ethically approved King Fahad Medical City Institutional Review Board. The 20 Mice cadavers were ethically gained from the university of Dundee animal house. They were euthanized ethically by carbon dioxide. They were handled by following the universitys ethical code. The mice were split into 4 groups with 5 mice for each group, where group 1 is fresh unfixed. Group 2 standard Theil embalmed. Group 3 defrosted one-week frozen mice then standard embalmed. group 4 perfused with Theil fluid, frozen, defrosted then set in the embalming tank. The embalming validation tests were made by visual gross and histological changes in the gastric, renal and muscular tissue. These tissues were chosen to test the penetration of the embalming solution. The results show similarity in all groups with difference of internal gross changes in the pre-frozen cadavers. Histological changes were similar in all embalmed groups meaning that the embalming method has been successful from a histological point of view."

The Results section is structured into three main parts. The first one describes the study sample of European postdoctoral researchers, including participants demographics, funding sources and income, research outputs, and teaching opportunities. The second section focuses on their professional aspirations and institutional support provided. The third part describes the level of engagement of postdoctoral researchers and their institutions in working towards better research conditions and career development, and what initiatives are emerging within this community.

Our Conclusions section pulls together this comprehensive analysis, highlighting some of the most concerning issues currently affecting postdoctoral researchers in Europe. We also make a number of recommendations that would significantly improve the career expectations and aspirations of postdoctoral researchers. These are listed below.

Conclusions and recommendationsO_LILonger postdoctoral periods in Southern Europe despite higher publication metrics
Recommendation Institutions in Southern Europe should develop clear criteria to support postdoctoral researchers career progression.
C_LIO_LISouthern and Eastern Europe pay the lowest salaries and have the lowest number of foreign postdoctoral researchers
Recommendation The salary differences across European countries should be addressed as this could be a barrier to mobility and knowledge exchange from higher to lower pay regions.
C_LIO_LILack of access to funding is a significant concern of postdoctoral researchers
Recommendation Discrepancies in access to funding should be minimized across the different European areas.
C_LIO_LIPostdoctoral researchers in Europe work longer hours than required by contract
Recommendation The culture of overwork in the research environment should be addressed in order to protect researchers against the risks associated with long hours at work.
C_LIO_LIThe majority of full-time postdoctoral work contracts includes an exclusivity clause
Recommendation Inclusion of exclusivity clauses in contracts for postdoctoral researchers should be optional in order to allow them to enhance their employability outside academia.
C_LIO_LIPostdoctoral researchers career development is poorly supported by their institutions
Recommendation Postdoctoral researchers career prospects and career management should be much more supported by institutions in coordination with postdoctoral associations.
C_LIO_LILack of postdoctoral representation in governance is linked to unclear institutional duties and rights
Recommendation Institutional governance bodies should include postdoctoral researcher representatives. This would ensure that the views of this vital staff group are heard, as well as making postdoctoral researchers feel more engaged with their own institutions. A flexible and proactive communication strategy at the institution and research group level should be developed, taking into account the sometimes transient nature of postdoctoral researchers posts.
C_LIO_LIResearchers show higher engagement with their local postdoctoral associations than with workers unions
Recommendation Postdoctoral associations are an essential way to advocate for postdoctoral researchers at the governance level. Institutions should engage with, promote and support the work of postdoctoral associations.

W.",Enjeline  Hanafi,2019-01-31,scientific communication and education,"Temperament profiles of an individual with high novelty seeking and low harm avoidance have been reported to be related to substance addiction, but smartphone addiction could be different from substance addiction. Medical students have high exposure to smartphone use. Screening their risk of smartphone addiction based on the temperament profile may help in deciding best prevention approach. This research aimed to examine the temperament profile and its association with vulnerability to smartphone addiction of medical students in Jakarta, Indonesia. The research was conducted with cross sectional design and simple random sampling. The Temperament and Character Inventory and the Smartphone Addiction Scale were used to measure desired outcomes. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the relationship between demographic factors, pattern of smartphone use, temperament type, and vulnerability to smartphone addiction. Of the 185 samples, most subjects have low novelty seeking, high reward dependence, and high harm avoidance. The average smartphone usage in a day was 7.94 hours (SD 3.92) with the initial age of smartphone usage was 7.58 years (SD 2.43). The respondents used smartphone for communication and accessing social media. High harm avoidance temperament was significantly associated with risk of smartphone addiction with OR 2.035; 95% CI 1.119 to 3.701). This study shows that smartphone addiction has similarities with other behavior addictions. Harm avoidance temperament is associated with the risk of smartphone addiction. Screening on risk of smartphone addiction based on temperament type should be done on medical students."

Eisen,2019-01-31,scientific communication and education,"In 2004, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation launched a new program focused on incubating a new field, ""Microbiology of the Built Environment"" (MoBE). By the end of 2017, the program had supported the publication of hundreds of scholarly works, but it was unclear to what extent it had stimulated the development of a new research community. We identified 307 works funded by the MoBE program, as well as a comparison set of 698 authors who published in the same journals during the same period of time but were not part of the Sloan Foundation-funded collaboration. Our analysis of collaboration networks for both groups of authors suggests that the Sloan Foundations program resulted in a more consolidated community of researchers, specifically in terms of number of components, diameter, density, and transitivity of the coauthor networks. In addition to highlighting the success of this particular program, our method could be applied to other fields to examine the impact of funding programs and other large-scale initiatives on the formation of research communities."

An engaging curriculum that facilitates children in achieving their academic potential has strong implications for educational outcomes, future employment prospects and health and wellbeing during adulthood. Outdoor learning is a pedagogical approach used to enrich learning, enhance school engagement and improve pupil health and wellbeing. However, its non-traditional means of achieving curricular aims are not yet recognised beyond the early years by education inspectorates. This requires evidence into its acceptability from those at the forefront of delivery. This study aimed to explore headteachers, teachers and pupils views and experiences of an outdoor learning programme within the key stage two curriculum (ages 9-11). We examine the process of implementation to offer case study evidence through 1:1 interviews with headteachers (n=3) and teachers (n=10) and focus groups with pupils aged 9-11 (n=10) from three primary schools. Interviews and focus groups were conducted at baseline and six months into implementation. Schools introduced regular outdoor learning within the curriculum. This study found a variety of perceived benefits for pupils and schools. Pupils and teachers noticed improvements in pupils engagement with learning, concentration and behaviour, as well as positive impacts on health and wellbeing and teachers job satisfaction. Curriculum demands including testing and evidencing work were barriers to implementation, in addition to safety concerns, resources and teacher confidence. Participants supported outdoor learning as a curriculum-based programme for older primary school pupils. However, embedding outdoor learning within the curriculum requires education inspectorates to place higher value on this approach in achieving curricular aims, alongside greater acknowledgment of the wider benefits to children which current measurements do not capture."

The projects R package is a free, open-source endeavor created in the interest of facilitating reproducible research workflows. It adds to existing software tools for reproducible research and introduces several practical features that are helpful for scientists and their collaborative research teams. For each individual project, it supplies an intuitive framework for storing raw and cleaned study data sets, and provides script templates for protocol creation, data cleaning, data analysis and manuscript development. Internal databases of project and author information are generated and displayed, and manuscript title pages containing author lists and their affiliations are automatically generated from the internal database. File management tools allow teams to organize multiple projects. When used on a shared file system, multiple researchers can harmoniously contribute to the same project in a less punctuated manner, reducing the frequency of misunderstandings and the need for status updates."

B.; Watkins, E. S.",Elizabeth A. Silva,2019-02-08,scientific communication and education,"Universities are at long last undertaking efforts to collect and disseminate information about student career outcomes, after decades of calls to action. Organizations such as Rescuing Biomedical Research and Future of Research brought this issue to the forefront of graduate education, and the second Future of Biomedical Graduate and Postdoctoral Training conference (FOBGAPT2) featured the collection of career outcomes data in its final recommendations, published in this journal (Hitchcock et al., 2017). More recently, 26 institutions assembled as the Coalition for Next Generation Life Science, committing to ongoing collection and dissemination of career data for both graduate and postdoc alumni. A few individual institutions have shared snapshots of the data in peer-reviewed publications (Mathur et al., 2018; Silva, des Jarlais, Lindstaedt, Rotman, Watkins, 2016) and on websites. As more and more institutions take up this call to action, they will now be looking for tools, protocols, and best practices for ongoing career outcomes data collection, management, and dissemination. Here, we describe UCSF's experiences in conducting a retrospective study, and in institutionalizing a methodology for annual data collection and dissemination. We describe and share all tools we have developed, and we provide calculations of the time and resources required to accomplish both retrospective studies and annual updates. We also include broader recommendations for implementation at your own institutions, increasing the feasibility of this endeavor."

Lists of threatened species are often used as media outreach tools, but their usefulness is rarely tested. We investigated whether the inclusion of a species in the list ""Worlds 25 Most Endangered Primates"", published biannually by the International Primatological Society, the International Union for Conservation of Natures Species Survival Commission Primate Specialist Group, and Conservation International from 2000, had an effect both on scientific publications and on the general public. We analyzed a database of 40 million articles from major scientific publishers (Elsevier, Springer, Nature, Plos, Pubmed, Biomed Central) finding an increase in the number of papers mentioning a species after its inclusion in the list. We also analyzed media penetration (data from Google News), and online interest (data from Google Blogs, Twitter, and Google Trends), collecting daily data for one month before and one after the official launch of the 2014-2016 list (24th November 2015). The results show a short spike of interest on Google News and Twitter but no long term effect, indicating a limited effect on the general public. Our results are important for the understanding of the impact of current conservation campaigns and to provide strategies for future campaigns."

K.; Vohra, C.; Raghav, P.",Manoj  Kumar  Gupta,2019-02-11,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundTo reduce the magnitude of antimicrobial resistance, there is a need to change the knowledge and behavior of future prescribers regarding use and prescription of antibiotics. This can be ensured through the appropriate training of next generation doctors and medical students. But, before planning or strengthening any teaching or training program for any group, it is required to have a conclusive evidence about knowledge, attitude and practices of that group. With this background this study was conducted to assess the knowledge, attitudes and the practices of medical students in India with respect to antibiotic resistance and usage

MethodsIt was a cross-sectional study which was done online through google forms. A semi-structured questionnaire containing a five point Likert scale was used for the data collection. The questionnaire was sent to medical students across India by sharing link through contacts of Medical Students Association of India. Respondent-driven sampling technique was also adopted for the study. Data was analyzed using SPSS v.25 and Microsoft Excel 2016.

ResultsThe overall mean score of awareness for the students was 4.36 + 0.39. As compared to first year students, mean score of awareness was significantly higher among students of all the years. A significantly better awareness was also observed among pre final year students as compared to other years. Variable practices have been observed regarding use of antibiotics among medical students.

ConclusionThe awareness level of medical students regarding antibiotics and its resistance was quite satisfactory. As far as attitude and practices are concerned, there is a significant need for improvements."

The fear among public health professionals and policymakers is that these work requirements will disproportionately limit access to health insurance for African-Americans. To investigate these new work requirements for Medicaid, we conducted a systematic review of the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, the last major welfare program to have such work requirements. We used the ProQuest database and selected scholarly journal studies in English and published between January 1991-August 2018. Our selection strategy yielded 14 eligible studies, eight of which focused on caseload movements and six focused on sanctions. We found that African-Americans entered TANF at a higher rate than Whites, remained on TANF longer, and were subject to sanctions more frequently and stringently than Whites were. These results suggest that African-Americans may disproportionately experience reduced access to care through sanctioning such as lockout periods. Recommended policy changes include prohibiting work activities as a condition of Medicaid coverage, strengthening Medicaid in other ways, combating discriminatory hiring practices, and easing burdensome reporting requirements."

Stroke can adversely affect coordination and judgement of drivers due to the executive dysfunction, which is relatively common in the post-stroke population but often undetected. Quantitatively examining vehicle control performance in post-stroke driving becomes essential to inspect whether and where post-stroke drivers are risky. To date, it is unclear as to which indicators, such as lane keeping or speed control, can differentiate driving performance of post-stroke drivers from that of normal (neurotypical) older drivers. By employing a case-control design using advanced vehicle movement tracking and analysis technology, this pilot study aimed to compare the variations in driving trajectory, lane keeping and speed control between the two groups using spatial and statistical techniques. The results showed that the mean Standard Deviation of Lane Deviation (SDLD) in post-stroke participants was higher than those of normal participants in complex driving tasks (U-turn and left turn) but almost the same in simple driving tasks (straight-line sections). No statistically significant differences were found in the speed maintenance between the post-stroke drivers and the normal adults. The findings indicate that, although older drivers can still drive as they need to after a stroke, the decline in cognitive abilities still imposes higher cognitive workload and more effort for post-stroke older drivers. Future studies can investigate post-stroke adults driving behaviour at more challenging driving scenarios, or design driving intervention program to improve their executive function in driving."

From 1991, the journal Nucleic Acids Research has published an annual Database Issue dedicated to articles describing molecular biology databases. Analysis of these articles reveals a set of long-lived databases which have now remained available for more than 15 years. Given the pervasive challenge of sustaining community resources, these databases provide an opportunity to examine what factors contribute to persistence by addressing two questions 1) which organizations fund these long-lived databases? and 2) which organizations maintain these long-lived databases? Funding and operating organizations for 67 databases were determined through review of Database Issue articles. The results reveal a diverse set of contributing organizations with financial and operational support spread across six categories: academic, consortium/collective, government, industry, philanthropic, and society/association. The majority of databases reported support from more than one funding organization, of which government organizations were most common source of funds. Operational responsibilities were more distributed, with academic organizations serving as the most common hosts. Although overall there is evidence of diversification, the most acknowledged funding and operating organizations contribute to disproportionately large percentages of the long-lived databases investigated here."

In order to achieve this challenge, we select a sample of 19 countries considered partners in science and technology. On the one hand we download social and economic variables (gross domestic expenditure on R&D (GERD) as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) and researchers in full-time equivalent (FTE)) and on the other hand variables related to scientific results (total scientific production, scientific production by subject areas and by different institutions, without overlook the citations received as an impact measure) all this data within a 17-year time window. Through a causal model with multiple linear regression using panel data, the experiment confirms that two independent (or explanatory) variables of five selected explain the amount of scientific production by 98% for the countries analyzed. An important conclusion that we highlight stays the importance of checking for compliance of statistical assumptions when using multiple regression in research studies. As a result, we built a reliable predictive model to analyze scenarios in which the increase in any of the independent variables causes a positive effect on scientific production. This model allows decision maker to make comparison among countries and helps in the formulation of future plans on national scientific policies."

M.; Sadowski, J.; Bodasinska, A.; Zielinski, J.; Niznikowski, T.; Mastalerz, A.",Hubert  Makaruk,2019-02-25,scientific communication and education,"The penalty kick is of great importance in the sport of soccer. Therefore, the aim of this study was to test predictions of the OPTIMAL theory and identify key attentional and motivational factors that impact the accuracy of the penalty kick. The following six groups of skilled participants performed penalty kicks following instructions that directed their focus of attention or impacted their autonomy support: external focus with autonomy support (EF/AS), external focus alone (EF), internal focus with autonomy support (IF/AS), internal focus alone (IF), autonomy support alone (AS) and control (C) groups. The analysis showed that the EF/AS group demonstrated better kicking accuracy relatively to the IF/AS, IF and C groups, but there were no significant differences between the EF/AS and EF or AS groups. Interestingly, the EF/AS group showed higher self-efficacy compared to the EF, IF/AS, IF and C groups. The finding suggest that a combination of attentional and motivational factors may produce benefits in motor performance."

Optimum pH, biomass concentration and contact time were estimated at 2.0, 1.0 g/L and 60 min respectively. Data obtained from batch studies confirmed well to the Langmuir model. It was found that the overall biosorption process was best described by pseudo second-order kinetics. The results demonstrated that intraparticle diffusion is not the sole rate-controlling step for the whole sorption process. In binary mixtures, biosorption efficiency of Cr(VI) was not significantly affected by the presence of ions up to 50 mg/L. Thermodynamic study showed that Cr(VI) biosorption on Eupatorium adenophorum-alginate beads was spontaneous, exothermic and physisorption in nature. Cr(VI) ions were recovered effectively from Eupatorium adenophorum-alginate beads using 0.5 M HNO3 solution."

V.; Henderson, L. R.; Kiparoglou, V.",Evanthia  Kalpazidou Schmidt,2019-02-26,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundGiven that the complex mix of structural, cultural, and institutional factors has produced barriers for women in science, an equally complex intervention is required to understand and address them. The Athena SWAN award scheme for gender equality has become a widespread means to address barriers for womens advancement and leadership in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, the United States of America, and Canada, while he European Commission is exploring the introduction of a similar award scheme across Europe.

MethodsThis study analyses the design and implementation of 16 departmental Athena SWAN Silver action plans in Medical Sciences at one of the worlds leading universities in Oxford, United Kingdom. Data pertaining to the design and implementation of gender equality interventions were extracted from the action plans, analysed thematically, coded using categories from the 2015 Athena SWAN Charter Awards Handbook, and synthesised against a typology of gender equality interventions in the European Research Area. The results were further analysed against the complexity research literature framework, where research organisations are perceived as dynamic systems that adapt, interact and co-evolve with other systems.

ResultsAthena SWAN is a complex contextually-embedded system of action planning within the context of universities. It depends on a multitude of contextual variables that relate in complex, non-linear ways, and dynamically adapt to constantly moving targets and new emergent conditions. Athena SWAN Silver action plans conform to the key considerations of complexity: 1) multiple actions and areas of intervention with a focus on the complex system embedded in and the local dynamics, 2) the non-linearity of interventions and the constantly emerging conditions, 3) impact in terms of contribution to change, improved conditions to foster change, and the increased probability that change can occur.

ConclusionsTo enact effective sustainable gender equality structural and cultural change, it is necessary to acknowledge and operationalize complexity as a frame of reference. Athena SWAN is the single most comprehensive and systemic gender equality scheme in Europe and can be strengthened further by promoting the integration of sex and gender analysis in research and education. Gender equality policies in the wider European Research Area can benefit from exploring Athena SWANs contextually-embedded systemic approach to dynamic action planning and inclusive focus on all genders and categories of staff and students."

J.",Christos A Ouzounis,2019-02-28,scientific communication and education,"The linguistic foundations of science and technology have relied on a range of terms many of which are borrowed from ancient languages, a known but little researched fact from a statistical perspective. Precise definitions and novel concepts are often crafted with those -- frequently used -- terms, yet their etymology from Greek or Latin might not always be fully appreciated. Herein, we demonstrate that frequently used terms span almost the entire PubMed(R) database, while a handful of terms of Greek origin retrieve 80% of all entries. We argue that the etymology of those critical terms needs to be fully grasped to ensure correct use, in conjunction with other concepts. We further propose a number of terms for genomics, using prepositions that can accurately define subtle sub-disciplines of this ever-expanding field. Finally, we invite commentary by both the science community and the humanities, for possible adoption of suggested terms, not least to avoid inaccurate usage or inappropriate notions that may compromise clarity of meaning."

Yet, a comprehensive overview of research in the field is still missing. Here we describe methods, trends, publishing patterns, and impact of a decade of research on research integrity.\n\nTo give a comprehensive overview of research on research integrity, we first systematically searched SCOPUS, Web of Science, and PubMed for relevant articles published in English between 2005 and 2015. We then classified each relevant article according to its topic, several methodological characteristics, its general focus and findings, and its citation impact.\n\nWe included 986 articles in our analysis. We found that the body of literature on research integrity is growing in importance, and that the field is still largely dominated by non-empirical publications. Within the bulk of empirical records (N=342), researchers and students are most often studied, but other actors and the social context in which they interact, seem to be overlooked. The few empirical articles that examined determinants of misconduct found that problems from the research system (e.g., pressure, competition) were most likely to cause inadequate research practices. Paradoxically, the majority of empirical articles proposing approaches to foster integrity focused on techniques to build researchers awareness and compliance rather than techniques to change the research system.\n\nOur review highlights the areas, methods, and actors favoured in research on research integrity, and reveals a few blindspots. Involving non-researchers and reconnecting what is known to the approaches investigated may be the first step to generate executable knowledge that will allow us to increase the success of future approaches.\n\nA word from the authorsWe find important to mention that this manuscript underwent peer review and was rejected from the following journals:\n\nO_LIPLOS ONE\nO_LISubmitted 19th December 2017\nC_LIO_LIPeer-review and rejection received 26th June 2018.\nC_LI\nC_LIO_LIJournal of Science and Engineering Ethics (JSEE)\nO_LISubmitted 18th August 2018\nC_LIO_LIPeer-review response with major revision request received 9th September 2019\nC_LIO_LIRevision submitted 24th October 218\nC_LIO_LIRejection received 27th December 2018\nC_LI\nC_LI\n\nWe regret not having submitted this preprint before our first submission. Nonetheless, now after over one year in submission processes, we thought that we should make this manuscript and its data available as a pre-print before undergoing further submissions.\n\nIn order to promote transparency however, we asked both journal whether anonymous reviews could be added alongside this pre-print to ensure that readers are informed of the issues that disqualified our manuscript.\n\nPLOS ONE agreed for us to share the anonymous reviews which are now available -- together with our itemized changes and responses -- in the  Online Resource 5 - Peer Review Report. We thank the editors of the Journal of Science and Engineering Ethics and the integrity team of Springer Nature for thoroughly discussing our request, but unfortunately, given the closed peer review policy at Springer Nature, we were unable to provide information about the peer review from the Journal of Science and Engineering Ethics.\n\nWe advise our readers to look at the peer-review and be aware of the challenges and limitations attached with our work. Of course, we welcome comments and contributions to make our work better.\n\nSincerely,\n\nNoemie Aubert Bonn and Wim Pinxten"

In fact, this disease in children and adolescents has been increasing exponentially, with Kuwait being ranked second highest in the world regarding the number of T1D incidences. Kuwait is an oil-rich country known for its strong sense of familism, affiliative obedience, and filial obligation. Therefore, a familial study of this disease may disclose certain causative agents responsible for passing the disease on to subsequent generations.\n\nTo recruit T1D patients and their family members, three different scenarios were developed. First, since Kuwaiti families are generally obedient to their doctors, the authors decided to recruit the patients through their endocrine physicians. Second, home visits were performed for meeting the families requirements. In this case, a team consisting of one nurse, two phlebotomists (a male and a female, since some refused to be seen by the opposite gender), and a driver of the institutes car was arranged. Finally, two diabetes educators were employed to resolve any issues raised during the recruitment process. Utilizing these approaches helped convince the culturally and religiously oriented Kuwaiti families to participate in this study. In this case, the doctors and educators were not only aware of the obstacles in this population but also sensitive to the families beliefs. This paper reports on our experience in recruitment and presents a roadmap for any future familial studies on culturally tailored societies i.e. Arab populations."

E.; Bell, A.; Toseland, C.; Twelvetrees, A.",Alison  Twelvetrees,2019-03-10,scientific communication and education,"The data in this report summarises the responses gathered from 365 principle investigators of academic laboratories, who started their independent positions in the UK within the last 6 years up to 2018. We find that too many new investigators express frustration and poor optimism for the future. These data also reveal, that many of these individuals lack the support required to make a successful transition to independence and that simple measures could be put in place by both funders and universities in order to better support these early career researchers. We use these data to make both recommendations of good practice and for changes to policies that would make significant improvements to those currently finding independence challenging. We find that some new investigators face significant obstacles when building momentum and hiring a research team. In particular, access to PhD students. We also find some important areas such as starting salaries where significant gender differences persist, which cannot be explained by seniority. Our data also underlines the importance of support networks, within and outside the department, and the positive influence of good mentorship through this difficult career stage."

Muscle activation was recorded by surface electromyography of 19 elite male youth players. Participants performed five repetitions of the Bulgarian squat, lunge and the squat with an external load of 10 kg. Electrical activity was recorded for the rectus femoris, vastus medialis, vastus lateralis, biceps femoris and semitendinosus. No significant inter-limb differences were found (F1, 13=619; p=0.82; partial {eta}2=0.045). Significant differences were found in the muscle activation between different muscles within the muscle group (quadriceps and hamstrings) for each of the exercises: Bulgarian squat (F1,18=331: p<0.001; partial {eta}2=0.80), lunge (F4,72=114.5; p<0.001; partial {eta}2=0.86) and squat (F1,16=247.31; p<0.001; partial {eta}2=0.93).Differences were found between the concentric, isometric and eccentric phases of each of the exercises (F2, 26=52.27; p=0.02; partial {eta}2=0.80). The existence of an activation pattern of each of the muscles in the three proposed exercises could be used for muscle assessment and as a tool for injury recovery."

Z.; Vatovec, C.; Niles, M. T.; Ivakhiv, A.",Alexandra  Z.  Millarhouse,2019-03-13,scientific communication and education,"Aquatic pharmaceutical pollution poses ecotoxicological risks to the environment and human health. Consumer behaviors represent a significant source of pharmaceutical compounds found in water. Thus, understanding public perceptions of aquatic pharmaceutical pollution and developing effective risk communication techniques are critical to engaging society in the type of widespread change necessary for addressing the presence of pharmaceuticals in water. This mixed-methods pilot study applies conceptual metaphor theory in conjunction with construal level theory of psychological distance to assess the relationship of metaphoric framing to perceptions of aquatic pharmaceutical contamination across four principal dimensions of psychological distance (geographic, social, and temporal distance, and uncertainty). Additionally, this study assesses the direct impact of metaphor use on concern and willingness to act, which are positively associated with perceived psychological distance. Data were collected from a convenience sample (n = 20) of university students in Burlington, Vermont using cognitive interviewing. Results indicate that participants initially perceived pharmaceutical pollution as socially and geographically distant, temporally both distant and proximal, and agreed that the issue is certain. Representing aquatic pharmaceutical contamination through metaphor significantly reduced perceived social and geographic distance, suggesting a relationship between metaphoric framing and psychological distance warranting additional research. Metaphor use did not directly nor significantly impact concern or willingness to act. Additionally, participants preferred the metaphorically-framed visual intervention to the non-metaphor visual intervention. Theoretical and practical implications of metaphor use in risk communications are discussed."

But most colleges and universities in Mainland China have not yet carried out systematic death education courses.\n\nObjectiveThis study aims to explore the attitudes of college age students to determine how they approach the idea of death using questions that explore five separate dimensions of attitude and belief.\n\nMethodsWe invited students from seven colleges in Mainland China using invitations sent to each years WeChat group. Students participated by scanning a QR code, and were then directed to a website that contained a self-administered questionnaire. We received 1,206 completed interviews.\n\nResultsWe found evidence of a substantial gender difference in attitudes toward death. These differences remain after adjustment for differences between male and female in other correlates of death attitudes, and are not a function of gender differences in the dimensionality of the five scales used to characterize attitudes.\n\nConclusionUsing previous research on gender differences as a guide, we speculate that these differences originate in culturally-defined expectations that are gender-related, as well as in substantial differences in individual family experiences of death. These speculations can take the form of testable hypotheses that should explain differences within genders as well as between genders. We believe that better education about death for college students can shape healthier attitudes among both male and female."

The most widely used statistic for quantitative comparisons is the p-value. However, p-values suffer from several shortcomings. The most prominent shortcoming that is relevant for quantitative comparisons is that p-values fail to convey the magnitude of differences. The differences between conditions are best quantified by the determination of effect size. To democratize the calculation of effect size, we have developed a web-based tool. The tool uses bootstrapping to resample mean or median values for each of the conditions and these values are used to calculate the effect size and their compatibility interval. The web tool generates a graphical output, showing the bootstrap distribution of the difference next to the actual data for optimal interpretation. A tabular output with statistics and effect sizes is also generated and the table can be supplemented with p-values that are calculated with a randomization test.

Davey, R.",Evanthia  Kaimaklioti Samota,2019-03-20,scientific communication and education,"We constructed a survey to understand how authors and scientists view the issues around reproducibility, focusing on interactive elements such as interactive figures embedded within online publications, as a solution for enabling the reproducibility of experiments. We report the views of 251 researchers, comprising authors who have published in eLIFE Sciences, and those who work at the Norwich Biosciences Institutes (NBI). The survey also outlines to what extent researchers are occupied with reproducing experiments themselves. Currently, there is an increasing range of tools that attempt to address the production of reproducible research by making code, data, and analyses available to the community for reuse. We wanted to collect information about attitudes around the consumer end of the spectrum, where life scientists interact with research outputs to interpret scientific results. Static plots and figures within articles are a central part of this interpretation, and therefore we asked respondents to consider various features for an interactive figure within a research article that would allow them to better understand and reproduce a published analysis. The majority (91%) of respondents reported that when authors describe their research methodology (methods and analyses) in detail, published research can become more reproducible. The respondents believe that having interactive figures in published papers is a beneficial element to themselves, the papers they read as well as to their readers. Whilst interactive figures are one potential solution for consuming the results of research more effectively to enable reproducibility, we also review the equally pressing technical and cultural demands on researchers that need to be addressed to achieve greater success in reproducibility in the life sciences."

Despite these gains, maternal and infant mortality and morbidity rates in Kenya remain unacceptably high indicating that more work needs to be done.\n\nAimUsing data from the Access to Quality Care through Extending and Strengthening Health Systems (AQCESS) projects qualitative gender assessment, this paper examines and describes womens experience of disrespectful care during pregnancy, labour and delivery. The goal is to promote improved understanding of actual care conditions in order to develop interventions that can lift the standard of care, increase maternity facility use, and improve health outcomes for both women and newborns.\n\nMethodologyWe conducted sixteen focus group discussions (FGDs) with female adolescents, women, men and community health committee members. Twenty four key informants interviews (KII) including religious leaders, local government representatives, Ministry of Health (MOH) and local womens organizations were conducted. Data were captured through audio recordings and reflective field notes.\n\nResearch siteKisii and Kilifi Counties in Kenya.\n\nFindingsFindings show Nursing and medical care was sometimes disrespectful, humiliatings, uncompassionate, and neglectful. In both sites, male health workers were the most preferred by women as they were friendly and sensitive. Young women were more likely to be abused and women with disabled children were stigmatized.\n\nConclusionsKenya needs to enforce the implementation of the quality of care guidelines for pregnancy and delivery, including respectful maternity care of pregnant women. To make sure these procedures are enforced, measurable benchmarks for maternity care need to be established, and hospitals need to be regularly monitored to make sure they are achieved. Quality of care and compassionate and caring staff may lead to successful and sustainable use of facility care."

A.; Glisson, S.",Stephen  A  Gallo,2019-03-22,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundFunding agencies have long used panel discussion in the peer review of research grant proposals as a way to utilize a set of expertise and perspectives in making funding decisions. Little research has examined the quality of panel discussions and how effectively they are facilitated.

MethodsHere we present a mixed-method analysis of data from a survey of reviewers focused on their perceptions of the quality and facilitation of panel discussion from their last peer review experience.

ResultsReviewers indicated that panel discussions were viewed favorably in terms of participation, clarifying differing opinions, informing unassigned reviewers, and chair facilitation. However, some reviewers mentioned issues with panel discussions, including an uneven focus, limited participation from unassigned reviewers, and short discussion times. Most reviewers felt the discussions affected the review outcome, helped in choosing the best science, and were generally fair and balanced. However, those who felt the discussion did not affect the outcome were also more likely to evaluate panel communication negatively, and several reviewers mentioned potential sources of bias related to the discussion. While respondents strongly acknowledged the importance of the chair in ensuring appropriate facilitation of the discussion to influence scoring and to limit the influence of potential sources of bias from the discussion on scoring, nearly a third of respondents did not find the chair of their most recent panel to have performed these roles effectively.

ConclusionsIt is likely that improving chair training in the management of discussion as well as creating review procedures that are informed by the science of leadership and team communication would improve review processes and proposal review reliability."

Carneiro,2019-03-22,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundPreprint usage is growing rapidly in the life sciences; however, questions remain on the relative quality of preprints when compared to published articles. An objective dimension of quality that is readily measurable is completeness of reporting, as transparency can improve the readers ability to independently interpret data and reproduce findings.

MethodsIn this observational study, we initially compared independent samples of articles published in bioRxiv and in PubMed-indexed journals in 2016 using a quality of reporting questionnaire. After that, we performed paired comparisons between preprints from bioRxiv to their own peer-reviewed versions in journals.

ResultsPeer-reviewed articles had, on average, higher quality of reporting than preprints, although the difference was small, with absolute differences of 5.0% [95% CI 1.4, 8.6] and 4.7% [95% CI 2.4, 7.0] of reported items in the independent samples and paired sample comparison, respectively. There were larger differences favoring peer-reviewed articles in subjective ratings of how clearly titles and abstracts presented the main findings and how easy it was to locate relevant reporting information. Changes in reporting from preprints to peer-reviewed versions did not correlate with the impact factor of the publication venue or with the time lag from bioRxiv to journal publication.

ConclusionsOur results suggest that, on average, publication in a peer-reviewed journal is associated with improvement in quality of reporting. They also show that quality of reporting in preprints in the life sciences is within a similar range as that of peer-reviewed articles, albeit slightly lower on average, supporting the idea that preprints should be considered valid scientific contributions."

Stewart-Ibarra,2019-03-25,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundSmall island developing states (SIDS) in the Caribbean region are challenged with managing the health outcomes of a changing climate. Health and climate sectors have partnered to co-develop climate services to improve the management of these diseases, for example, through the development of climate-driven early warning systems. The objective of this study was to identify health and climate stakeholder perceptions and needs in the Caribbean, with respect to the development of climate services for arboviruses (e.g. dengue, chikungunya, and Zika).\n\nMethodsStakeholders included public decision makers and practitioners from the climate and health sectors at the regional (Caribbean) level and from the countries of Dominica and Barbados. From April to June 2017, we conducted interviews (n=41), surveys (n=32), and national workshops with stakeholders. Survey responses were tabulated and audio recordings were transcribed and analyzed using qualitative coding to identify responses by research topic, country/region, and sector.\n\nResultsHealth practitioners indicated that their jurisdiction is currently experiencing an increased risk of diseases transmitted by Ae. aegypti due to climate variability, and most anticipated that this risk will increase in the future. National health sectors reported financial limitations and a lack of technical expertise in geographic information systems (GIS), statistics, and modeling, which constrained their ability to implement climate services for arboviruses. National climate sectors were constrained by a lack of personnel. Stakeholders highlighted the need to strengthen partnerships with the private sector, academia, and civil society. They identified a gap in local research on climate-arbovirus linkages, which constrained the ability of the health sector to make informed decisions. Strategies to strengthen the climate-health partnership included a top-down approach by engaging senior leadership, multi-lateral collaboration agreements, national committees on climate and health, and shared spaces of dialogue. Mechanisms for mainstreaming climate services for health operations to control arboviruses included climate-health bulletins and an online GIS platform that would allow for regional data sharing and the generation of spatiotemporal epidemic forecasts.\n\nConclusionsThese findings support the creation of interdisciplinary and intersectoral communities of practices and the co-design of climate services for the Caribbean public health sector. By fostering the effective use of climate information within health policy, research and practice, nations will have greater capacity to adapt to a changing climate."

After comparing online reviews and news reports of Chinese doctors, they carefully choose doctors. It is precisely because of the patients treatment habits that many doctors have spread health information through their own microblogs, WeChat public numbers, websites, videos and other means. Therefore, doctors speeches in cyberspace often play a dominant role in the development of health communication and guide the risk communication. This paper studies the influencing factors of Chinese doctors healthy communication behavior in online media. This has positive reference value for improving the health literacy of the whole people and the crisis management and guidance of public events.\n\nMethodsIn order to maximize the representativeness of the sample, the universality of the problems reflected in the survey data, and the adaptability of the purpose and method of the research questions, this paper adopts a multi-stage sampling method. In each region, a medical institution is selected according to a simple random sampling method in three types of hospitals: public hospitals, social hospitals, and primary medical institutions. A total of 10-11 medical institutions were selected in each region, and a total of 32 hospitals were selected from the three regions. According to the PPS sampling method, a corresponding number of working doctors are drawn in each hospital. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using SPSS 21.0 statistical software.\n\nAnalysisThe study found that doctors transmission of health-related content on online media is still at a lower level of involvement, and the frequency of transmission is significantly lower than the general level. There are also significant differences in the health transmission of doctors from different backgrounds on the Internet. In the context of control hospital background, continue to examine the impact of Media usage and occupational psychology on doctors dissemination of health-related content. The results show that the influence of Media usage on the health communication behavior of doctors on the Internet media, to a certain extent, verifies that the rise of online media plays a significant role in putting doctors into health science. This also shows that the media has fostered the doctors communication behavior. In addition, the higher the self-efficacy of doctors in the workplace, the more cautious they are about their words and deeds, the more they care about the impact of their speech on interpersonal communication."

T.; Hirayama, K.",Kenji  Hirayama,2019-03-27,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundChagas disease (CD), typically confined to the Latin America (LA) region, is emerging as a global health problem. In Japan, as in the rest of world, the under-diagnose rate of CD is alarmingly high. Various studies have highlighted the importance of informed knowledge in the seeking behavior. Educational integrative activities, with consideration for socio-cultural factors, can help increase the knowledge of the participants. There has been no studies that analyze the difference in knowledge, before and after these educational activities. This study aimed to qualitatively and quantitatively investigate the knowledge, behavior and attitude toward CD among LA migrants in Japan and to evaluate the effectiveness of the community educational activity in increasing knowledge of CD.\n\nMethodologyThis cross-sectional study involved two questionnaires to analyze the knowledge of the LA migrant participants before and after the community activity (CA) in four cities in Japan (Oizumi, Suzuka, Hadano, and Nagoya).\n\nPrincipal FindingsA total of 75 participants were enrolled, predominantly Bolivians from hyperendemic areas. The baseline knowledge of CD was low. However, most of them were familiar with the disease although less than 10% of them had been tested for CD before. Living in Japan for more than 10 years and previously being tested for CD were the factors associated with better knowledge. The conducted CA significantly improved the knowledge of the participants. They associated the term \""Chagas\"" mostly with fear and concern. In contrast to other studies, the level of stigmatization was low. The barriers in care seeking behavior were language, migration process and difficulties to access to the healthcare system.\n\nConclusionEducational activities with integrative approach are useful to increase knowledge of CD. The activity brings the possibility to explore not only the level of knowledge, but also to reveal the experience and to understand the needs of the people at risk.\n\nAuthor SummaryThough the incident rate of Chagas disease (CD) has fallen, more than 7 million people are affected worldwide. The CD prevalence is under-estimated because just 1% of these affected people can access to the diagnosis and treatment. This situation is maintaining mainly for the lack of implication of socio-cultural factors in the interventions to decrease the burden of the disease. Educational activities with integral approach are useful to increase the knowledge of the people at risk. People that have being tested for CD before or living in Japan for more than 10 years have better knowledge about the disease, suggesting the importance of knowledge in the seeking behavior. The authors recommend the implementation of educational activities with integral approach as a strategy to improves the knowledge of Chagas disease among Latin America migrants in Japan."

S.",John  E  Fa,2019-03-27,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundAfrican Pygmies exhibit a unique, genetically determined child growth dynamics and adult stature but the impact on assessing undernutrition remains unknown. Baka Pygmy health is highly compromised compared to sympatric populations. Evaluating child undernutrition is an important step to address this health quandry. We estimate stunting and wasting in Cameroons Baka children and investigate the applicability of the standards for Pygmy people.\n\nMethodsAnthropometric and health data from 685 2-to12 year old children were collected at 25 health centres in southern Cameroon. Growth was analysed using both, WHO Child Growth Standards and the population itself as reference to define frequencies of stunting, wasting and obesity.\n\nFindingsBaka children revealed with 68.4% the highest recorded level globally of stunting relative to the WHO child growth standard in 2-to-4 year olds. Wasting was at 8.2% in the upper third range in Sub-Saharan Africa. Obesity was with 6.5% similar to wasting, but no comparable data have been published for Sub-Saharan Africa. When referenced to the Baka population itself, values for stunting were dramatically lower at 1.0% and 2.9% for 2-to-4 and 5-to-12 year olds, respectively. Wasting was also lower at 2.8% and 1.8% and was exceeded by obesity at 3.4% and 3.5%, respectively. Brachial perimeters and oedemas indicated rare severe malnutrition (< 2%) whilst moderate and severe anaemia were frequent (26.6% and 3.3%, respectively).\n\nInterpretationWHO child growth standards for stunting are clearly not applicable to Pygmies thus contradicting the widespread emphasis of their ethnicity-independent applicability. The inferred values for wasting and obesity are also difficult to interpret and are likely overestimated by the WHO criteria. To achieve UN Sustainable Development Goals and to fulfil our humanitarian responsibility for fellow man, we recommend that Pygmy specific growth standards are developed for the genetically differing Pygmy tribes."

A.; Pomerantz, A.; Prost, S.",Mrinalini  Watsa,2019-03-29,scientific communication and education,"Genetic research is a rapidly evolving field of study that is increasingly being utilized as a tool for wildlife conservation. However, researchers and science educators in remote areas can often find it difficult to access the latest genetic technologies, often due to a combination of high costs, bulky equipment, and lack of infrastructure. Recent technological innovations are resulting in portable, low-cost instruments that enable next-generation sequencing in remote environments, offering new opportunities to generate a more widespread network of trained conservation scientists, particularly within regions of high biodiversity. What is currently lacking are formalized educational efforts to teach participants in biodiverse areas with hands-on training in molecular biology and real-time DNA sequencing techniques. To address this challenge, we report the design and summarized feedback/outcomes of a conservation genetics field course, called  Genomics in the Jungle, that took place at a field research station in the Amazon rainforest of southeastern Peru. The program was established by a small US-based NGO, Field Projects International, and facilitated by a local eco-tourism company in Peru, Inkaterra. We utilized portable sequencing technologies from Oxford Nanopore Technologies, and in-kind support from the manufacturers MiniPCR, MiniOne Systems, Promega, and New England Biolabs. Participants included a mix of non-Peruvian students and local/regional students, some of which had no prior exposure to a genetics laboratory. Overall, we maintain that portable sequencing technology is democratizing scientific research and conservation efforts, and is a major step forward for science educators and conservationists."
10.1101/593905,Breaking barriers: The effect of protected characteristics and their intersectionality on career transition in academics,"Wanelik, K. M.; Griffin, J. S.; Head, M.; Ingleby, F. C.; Lewis, Z.",Zenobia  Lewis,2019-03-31,scientific communication and education,"Lay summaryIn the past decade the scientific community has been trying to tackle the historical underrepresentation of women in science and the fact that gender can constitute a barrier to career success. However, other characteristics, such as being of an ethnic minority or coming from an under-privileged background, have received less attention. In this study we find that ethnicity and socioeconomic status impact detrimentally on career progression in early career scientists, despite the fact that gender is more likely to be reported as a barrier. Our data suggest we need to widen the discussion regarding diversity and equality in science to incorporate potential barriers to career success in addition to gender.\n\nAbstractThe academic disciplines of Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) have long suffered from a lack of diversity. While in recent years there has been some progress in addressing the underrepresentation of women in STEM subjects, other protected characteristics have received less attention. In this study, we survey early career scientists in the fields of ecology, evolutionary biology, behaviour, and related disciplines. We (i) quantitatively examine the effect of protected characteristics and their intersectionality on career transition, and (ii) provide practical suggestions, based on the qualitative responses of those surveyed, for overcoming some of the barriers we identified. We found that socioeconomic background and ethnicity impacted negatively on the quantitative measures of career progression we examined. Respondents that were female, LGBT, and from a lower socioeconomic background were more likely to report having faced a barrier, and the most frequent barrier named was related to gender. Our results suggest that respondents may have felt more confident discussing the experiences they have had related to their gender, potentially because there is now widespread discourse on this subject. However, respondents were less likely to discuss barriers they have faced in relation to ethnicity and socioeconomic status, despite the fact that the data indicates these are more detrimental to career progression. This may reflect the fact that these characteristics have received less attention, and are therefore deemed more sensitive. We hope that this study will stimulate wider discussion, and help to inform strategies to address the underrepresentation of minority groups in STEM subjects."

Even though GTAs are the driving instructional force in biology laboratories, they receive little to no training in pedagogical principles and applications. Here, we present the GTAs self-reported unmet training needs with respect to teaching biology laboratory courses. To address these needs, we developed three training cases along with instructions for implementation in online and in-person GTA trainings. We piloted our training materials for GTA training in person at Iowa State University and in a Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching, and Learning three-part online workshop. Upon completion of these training sessions, GTAs reported an increase in both their confidence and knowledge of student-centered instructional approaches. Furthermore, examination of the online workshop participants lesson plans demonstrated that GTAs were able to implement effective teaching practices in their own lesson plans. For brief training sessions, these are positive outcomes suggesting these cases are effective tools that could be incorporated into a variety of GTA training programs to improve instruction in biology laboratory courses."

One can also ask about similarities or differences in the growth pattern. Quantitative studies of the growth of dinosaurs have made possible comparisons with modern animals, such as the discovery that dinosaurs grew in relation to their size faster than modern reptiles. However, these studies relied on only a few growth models. If these models are false, what about the conclusions? This paper fits growth data to a more comprehensive class of models, defined by the von Bertalanffy-Putter differential equation. Applied to data about dinosaurs, reptiles and birds, the best fitting models confirmed that dinosaurs may have grown faster than alligators. However, compared to modern broiler chicken, this difference was small."

Theoretically, track assignment maximizes individual outcomes when thresholds between tracks are set at the level of the indifferent student, and any other thresholds would imply that students at or around the margin are better off by switching tracks. We exploit non-linearities in the probability of track assignment across achievement to empirically identify the effect of track assignment on educational attainment and wages of students in the Netherlands, who can be assigned to four different tracks. We find that attending higher tracks leads to increases in years of schooling by around 1.5 years for students at the lowest and the highest choice margin, and wage gains of around 15% and 5%, respectively. Results at the margin of the two medium tracks show no effect on educational attainment, and decreases in wage of around 12% from attending the higher track. The negative returns for the medium margin and the relatively low returns for the higher margin (compared to the required educational investments) are partly mediated by motivation and study choice."

J.",Christopher Aidan Harris,2019-04-07,scientific communication and education,"Understanding the brain is a fascinating challenge, captivating the scientific community and the public alike. The lack of effective treatment for most brain disorders makes the training of the next generation of neuroscientists, engineers and physicians a key concern. Over the past decade there has been a growing effort to introduce neuroscience in primary and secondary schools, however hands-on laboratories have been limited to anatomical or electrophysiological activities. Modern neuroscience research labs are increasingly using computational tools to model circuits of the brain to understand information processing. Here we introduce the use of neurorobots - robots controlled by computer models of biological brains - as an introduction to computational neuroscience in the K-12 classroom. Neurorobotics has enormous potential as an education technology because it combines multiple activities with clear educational benefits including neuroscience, active learning, and robotics. We describe an introductory neurorobot workshop that teaches high school students how to use neurorobots to investigate key concepts in neuroscience, including spiking neural networks, synaptic plasticity, and adaptive action selection. Our do-it-yourself (DIY) neurorobot uses wheels, a camera, a speaker, and a distance sensor to interact with its environment, and can be built from generic parts costing about $150 in under 4 hrs. Our Neurorobot App visualizes the neurorobot's visual input and brain activity in real-time, and enables students to design new brains and deliver dopamine-like reward signals to reinforce chosen behaviors. We have tested the Neurorobot Workshop with high school students (n = 3 workshops, 9 students total) and have found that students were able to complete all exercises in under 3 hrs. In a post-workshop survey, students reported having gained the ability to develop neural networks that perform specific functions, including goal-directed behavior and memory. Here we provide DIY hardware assembly instructions, discuss our open-source Neurorobot App and demonstrate how to teach the Neurorobot Workshop. By doing this we hope to accelerate research in educational neurorobotics and promote the use of neurorobots to teach computational neuroscience in high school."

Additionally, the roles of positive and negative perfectionism in workaholism were investigated. The sample consisted of 686 employees. All of them completed the study instruments. The results showed that the mean of workaholism, positive perfectionism, and negative perfectionism were respectively 2.60, 4.04, and 3.53. Additionally, multivariate tests showed that the results of post hoc differences for positive perfectionism were in favor of males, subordinates, those with a bachelors degree, those with less than 5 years of experience, and those aged less than 30 years. Furthermore, the differences for negative perfectionism were in favor of those with a bachelors degree and subordinates. For workaholism, the differences were in favor of subordinates, public sector employees, married persons, and those with a diploma degree. Finally, the results of hierarchical regression analysis found that positive and negative perfectionism and some demographic variables predicted 129% of the variability in workaholism, and the typical hierarchical regression model included positive and negative perfectionism without other demographic variables."

The disease has a progressive course and leads to reduced life quality and life expectancy. Standard diagnostic procedures used in the monitoring of CF patients, include methods exposing patients to the ionizing radiation. With increasing life expectancy in CF the cumulative dose of ionising radiation increases, prompting clinicians search for safer imaging studies. Despite its safety and availability lung ultrasound (LUS) is not routinely used in the diagnostic evaluation of CF patients.\n\nThe aim of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of LUS in children with CF compared to chest X-ray, and to assess the diagnostic value of the recently developed LUS score - CF-USS (Cystic Fibrosis Ultrasound Score).\n\nLUS was performed in 48 CF children aged from 5 to 18 years (24 girls and 24 boys). LUS consisted in the assessment of the pleura, lung sliding, A-line and B-line artifacts, \""lung rockets\"", alveolar consolidations, air bronchogram and pleural effusion. Chest radiography was performed in all patients and analyzed according to the modified Chrispin-Norman score. LUS was analyzed according to CF-USS.\n\nCorrelation between the CF-USS and the modified Chrispin-Norman scores were moderate (R=0.52, p=0.0002) and strong in control studies. In 75% of patients undergoing LUS, small areas of subpleural consolidations were observed, not visible on X-rays. At the same time, LUS was not sensitive enough to visualize bronchial pathology, which plays an important role in assessing the disease progression.\n\nConclusionsLUS constitutes an invaluable tool for the diagnosis of subpleural consolidations. CF-USS results correlate with conventional x-ray modified Chrispin-Norman score. LUS should be considered an accessory radiographic examination in the monitoring of CF patients, and CF-USS may provide clinicians with valuable information concerning the disease progression."

When designing emergency accommodation, the concerns, preferences, and perspectives of individuals who access refuge services must be sought in order to create spaces that are conducive to the needs of this diverse and vulnerable group. An empathic  lens can provide meaningful insights that can inform the design of refuge services specifically targeted at addressing these needs.\n\nThis paper describes an authentic interdisciplinary learning experience for nursing, architecture and landscape students, and presents the results of a study designed to measure the impact of this initiative on participants empathy towards women and children who access refuge services as a result of homelessness and/or domestic violence. Empathy levels were measured using the Comprehensive State Empathy Scale.\n\nThe learning experience consisted of collaborative meetings with stakeholders from the refuge sector, fieldwork, individual research, exchanging ideas and problem-solving in teams. Students then developed design guides for refuges that demonstrated their emerging understanding of the specific needs and perspectives of the issues faced by women and children who were homeless.\n\nA convenience sample of 48 students (nursing n = 22; architecture n = 11; and landscape n = 13) participated in the study. Participants were aged from 19 to 37 years with an average of 23.8 years (SD= 3.65). Pre-post Comprehensive State Empathy Scale results indicated that the empathy levels of nursing and landscape students increased and those of architecture students decreased, however, these results were not statistically significant.\n\nIn Australia, one in six women have experienced domestic violence and domestic violence remains the single largest cause of homelessness for women. Yet reports suggest that these women frequently encounter discrimination, both in the community and when accessing services. As empathy is one of the strongest negative correlates of prejudice, authentic teaching and learning activities, such as the one described in this paper, have the potential to positively impact the lived experience of these women."

However, these indicators focus on characteristics of papers and journals, without referring clearly to the processes of knowledge production, communication and stabilization. Without understanding of the nature of interdisciplinarity and its various forms, the choice of indicators seems rather arbitrary. In this paper we argue that interdisciplinarity is one of the forms of development of research fields. We will show that interdisciplinarity is a temporary phase in knowledge dynamics. New fields emerge at the boundaries of existing fields as multidisciplinary research activities, and either develop through an interdisciplinary phase into a  new discipline, or remain multidisciplinary for a while and generally disappear.\n\nWe use the analysis of journal-journal citation relations to map the identity and development of disciplinary, multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary research fields. A comparison results in three types of identities: (1) disciplinary fields, (2) interdisciplinarity as a developmental phase from multidisciplinary to disciplinary fields, and (3) unstable temporal multidisciplinary research topics at the boundaries between research fields. We conclude that the main difference between a mature interdisciplinary field and  normal disciplinary fields is that the former is newer than the latter. We propose to focus on change in the research landscape, instead of on indicators for what is only one (early or long term unstable) stage of interdisciplinarity. The mapping approach can be used to identify the nature of cognitive change in general, such as the emergence, growth, differentiation, merger, and decline of research fields."

The heterogeneity of physiotherapy studies in Europe, local government, and health policies have influenced the responsibilities and ethical reasoning of physiotherapists. Our study aims to explore the perceptions and differences regarding informed consent (IC) and the role of physiotherapists in healthcare in an educational, legislative, and health policy context.\n\nMaterial and MethodsA cross-sectional survey was distributed online to physiotherapist graduates in Europe. The survey contained two open questions regarding IC and assumed role in healthcare. The data was operated to and analyzed by using a theory-based approach (open and axial coding), providing a qualitative spectrum of categories for the two items linked on IC and the role in healthcare.\n\nResultsEight categories of issues related to IC and seven categories related to the role in healthcare were identified. The physiotherapist graduates from Romania, France, Belgium, Italy, and other countries from inside and outside European Union response rate was 81.85% (n = 248 from 303) for the item related to IC and 71.62% (n = 217) to the second item related to the role in healthcare. A percent of 24.20% (n=60) are still considering IC a simple patient information process, while 23.40% (58) have linked IC with ethically and legally issues, 21.67% (n=51) of physiotherapists are minimizing their role in healthcare at restoring physical independence, while 6.91% (n=27) are aware of their multidisciplinary role.

Bunney,2019-04-18,scientific communication and education,"Substance Use Disorder (SUD) is a major public health concern affecting an estimated 22.5 million individuals in the United States. The primary aim of this study was to characterize psychological pain in a cohort of patients participating in outpatient substance abuse treatment. A secondary aim was to determine the relationships between pre-treatment assessments of psychological pain, depression, anxiety and hopelessness with treatment retention time and completion rates. Data was analyzed from 289 patients enrolled in an outpatient community drug treatment clinic that provides mental healthcare to the underserved. A previously determined threshold score on the Mee-Bunney Psychological Pain Assessment Scale (MBP) was utilized to group patients into high and low-moderate scoring subgroups. The higher pain group reported increased levels of anxiety, hopelessness and depression compared to those in the low-moderate pain group. Additionally, patients scoring in the higher psychological pain group exhibited reduced retention times in treatment and more than two-fold increased odds of dropout relative to patients with lower pre-treatment levels of psychological pain. Among all assessments, the correlation between psychological pain and treatment retention time was strongest. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that psychological pain is an important construct that correlates with relevant clinical outcomes in substance abuse treatment. Further, pre-treatment screening for psychological pain may be of benefit in identifying higher-risk patients in need of targeted additional clinical resources to improve treatment retention and completion rates."

Prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) service has been an important strategy in preventing HIV infections in infants. However, improving PMTCT service uptake and continuum of care still remains a significant impediment in the Amhara Region of Ethiopia. The aim of this study was to explore factors that may hinder and promote PMTCT service utilization among HIV positive women.\n\nMethodsPhenomenological study design was used. Three focus group discussions (FGDs) with HIV positive women and five in-depth interviews with health care workers were conducted from the selected health institutions. Data analysis was conducted using thematic content analysis. ATLAS/ti version 7.5.16 software was used to assist in coding and analysis of the qualitative data.\n\nResultsThe findings of the study revealed that there are a range of factors that influence HIV positive women on PMTCT service utilization. Stigma, discrimination, limited knowledge on HIV, lack of partner and family support, and not getting friendly service from health facility were factors that might hinder PMTCT service utilization. The experiences of HIV positive mothers revealed that continuous partner support, previous history of getting HIV free child, good health worker support, and advice by mother support group were factors that promote utilization of PMTCT service.\n\nConclusionsStrengthening community awareness on HIV, engaging male involvement in PMTCT care and getting friendly service were the key determinants for the better PMTCT service utilization."

We aimed to empirically test for an excess number of statistically significant results in the literature on rTMS therapeutic efficacy across a wide range of meta-analyses and to characterize the power of studies included in these meta-analyses.\n\nMethodsBased on power calculations, we computed the expected number of \""positive\"" datasets for a medium effect-size (standardized mean difference, SMD=0.30) and compared it with the number of observed \""positive\"" datasets. Sensitivity analyses considered small (SMD=0.20), modest (SMD=0.50), and large (SMD=0.80) effect sizes.\n\nResults14 meta-analyses with 228 datasets (110 for neurological disorders and 118 for psychiatric disorders) were assessed. For SMD=0.3, the number of observed \""positive\"" studies (n=94) was larger than expected (n=35). We found evidence for an excess of significant findings overall (p<0.0001) and in 8/14 meta-analyses. Evidence for an excess of significant findings was also observed for SMD=0.5 for neurological disorders. 0 (0 %), 0 (0 %), 3 (1 %), and 53 (23 %) of the 228 datasets had power >0.80, respectively for SMDs of 0.30, 0.20, 0.50, and 0.80.\n\nConclusionMost studies in the rTMS literature are underpowered.

C.",Lauren A Maggio,2019-04-23,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundAuthorship has major implications for a researchers promotion and tenure, future funding, and career opportunities. Due in part to these high-stakes consequences, many journals require authors to meet formal authorship criteria, e.g. the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) criteria for authorship. Yet on multiple surveys, researchers admit to violating these criteria, suggesting that authorship practices are a complex issue. Using qualitative methods, we aimed to unpack the complexities inherent in researchers conceptualizations of questionable authorship practices and to identify factors that make researchers vulnerable to engaging in such practices.\n\nMethods and FindingsWe conducted an interview study with a purposeful sample of 26 North American medical education researchers holding MD (n=17) and PhD (n=9) degrees and representing a range of career stages. We asked participants to respond to two vignettes - one portraying honorary authorship, the other describing an author order scenario - and then to describe related authorship experiences. Through thematic analysis, we found that participants, even when familiar with ICMJE criteria, conceptualized questionable authorship practices in various ways and articulated several ethical gray areas. We identified personal and situational factors, including hierarchy, resource dependence, institutional culture and gender, that contributed to participants vulnerability to and involvement in questionable authorship practices. Participants described negative instances of questionable authorship practices as well as situations in which these practices occurred for virtuous purposes. Participants rationalized that engagement in questionable authorship practices, while technically violating authorship criteria, could be reasonable when the practices seemed to benefit science and junior researchers. Participants described negative instances of questionable authorship practices as well as situations in which these practices occurred for virtuous purposes. Participants rationalized that engagement in questionable authorship practices, while technically violating authorship criteria, could be reasonable when the practices seemed to benefit science and junior researchers.\n\nConclusionAuthorship guidelines, such as the ICMJE criteria, portray authorship decisions as black and white, effectively sidestepping key dimensions that create ethical shades of gray. Our findings show that researchers generally recognize these shades of gray and in some cases acknowledge breaking or bending the rules themselves. Sometimes, their flexibility in applying rules of authorship is driven by benevolent aims that align with their own values or prevailing norms such as generosity and inclusivity. Other times, their participation in questionable authorship practices is framed not as a choice, but rather as a consequence of their vulnerability to individual or system factors beyond their control. Taken together, the findings reported here provide insights that may help researchers and institutions move beyond recognition of the challenges of authorship and contribute to the development of informed, evidence-based solutions for questionable authorship practices."

Obesity at an early age not only increases the risks of chronic diseases but also produces a problem for the whole healthcare system. One way to alleviate this problem is to provide each patient with an appropriate menu that can be defined with a mathematical model. Existing mathematical models only partially address the objective and constraints of childhood obesity; therefore, the solutions provided are insufficient for health specialists to prepare nutritional menus for individual patients. This manuscript proposes a multiobjective mathematical programming model to aid healthy nutritional menu planning to prevent childhood obesity. This model enables a plan for combinations and amounts of food across different schedules and daily meals. This approach minimizes the major risk factors of childhood obesity (i.e., glycemic load and cholesterol intake). In addition, it considers the minimization of nutritional mismatch and total cost. The model is solved using a deterministic method and two metaheuristic methods. To complete this numerical study, test instances associated with children aged 4-18 years old were created. The quality of the solutions generated using the three methods was similar, but the metaheuristic methods provided solutions in less computational time. The numerical results indicate proper guidelines for personalized plans for individual children."

A.; Apse, C.; Leisher, C.; Ngoile, M.; McIntyre, P. B.",Huruma  Mgana,2019-04-25,scientific communication and education,"Maintaining sustainable fisheries requires understanding the influence of technological advances on catch efficiency. Fisheries using light sources for attraction could be widely impacted by the shift to light emitting diode (LED) light systems. We studied the transition from kerosene lanterns to LED lamps in Lake Tanganyika, East Africa, examining factors that led to adoption as well as the impact of the new light sources on fish catch and composition. We used a combination of field experiments with catch assessments, fisher surveys, underwater light spectra measurements, and cost assessments to evaluate the impact of switching from kerosene to LED lamps. Overall, we found a very rapid rate of adoption of homemade outdoor LED light systems in Lake Tanganyika. Most of the batteries used to power these lamps were charged from the city power grid, rather than photovoltaic cells. The LED light spectra was distinct from the kerosene light and penetrated much deeper into the water column. Regardless of light type, most of the fish caught within the two dominant species were below maturity, indicating that current fishery is not sustainable. Although the LED lamps were associated with a slight increase in catch, environmental factors, particularly distance offshore, were generally more important in determining fish catch size and composition. The main advantages of the LED lamps were the lower operating costs and their robustness in bad weather. Overall, the use of battery-powered LED lighting systems to attract fish in Lake Tanganyika appears to reduce economic costs but not contribute new impacts on the fishery."

J.; Luo, X.",Rebekah  D  Wallace,2019-04-26,scientific communication and education,"As the prevalence of smartphones and smartphone applications has penetrated the cellular phone market, and the capabilities of features within smartphones allowed for the replacement of commonly used mapping and identification tools, Bugwood developers began to release smartphone applications for reporting invasive species. To encourage and demonstrate reporting, workshops have been held to walk users through these apps features and overall EDDMapS capabilities. To ascertain the effectiveness of workshops in encouraging reporting via smartphone apps and the EDDMapS MAEDN website, a General Linear Model was used to evaluate the number of records received across the 2012-2017 time frame and evaluate if there was a difference in the number of records in the years MAEDN workshops were held at the Mid-Atlantic Invasive Plant Council conferences and workshops and years no MAEDN workshop was held. The model indicated that the workshops and time were significant factors in the number of records submitted. Being able to confidently demonstrate the effect that workshops can positively impact data recruitment can aid in funding for outreach and educational events."

S.",Rebeccah S Lijek,2019-04-26,scientific communication and education,"The goal of this study is to shed light on the involvement of early career researchers (ECRs) during peer review of manuscripts for publication in journals. In particular, we sought to better understand how commonly ECRs contribute ideas and/or text to peer review reports when they are not the invited reviewer (\""co-review\""), and how commonly ECRs do not receive named credit to the journal editorial staff for these scholarly efforts (\""ghostwrite\""). First, we evaluated 1,952 publications in the peer-reviewed literature generated by exhaustive search terms that combined synonyms of \""early career researcher\"" and \""peer review\"" and found no previous studies about ECRs ghostwriting peer review reports. We then surveyed 498 researchers about their experiences with, and opinions about, co-reviewing and ghostwriting as ECRs. Three quarters of those surveyed have co-reviewed and most find it to be a beneficial (95% agree) and ethical (73% agree) form of training in peer review. Co-reviewing is the second most commonly reported form of training in peer review besides receiving reviews on ones own papers. Half of survey respondents have ghostwritten a peer review report, despite the 4/5ths majority opinion that ghostwriting is unethical. Survey respondents report that the three major barriers to including co-reviewer names on peer review reports are: a lack of communication between PIs and ECRs; a false belief that co-authorship is for manuscripts but not peer review reports; and prohibitive journal policies that are out of alignment with current practice and opinions about best practice. We therefore propose recommendations for changing this status quo, to discourage unethical ghostwriting of peer review reports and encourage quality co-reviewing experiences as normal training in peer review."

10.1101/622886,The Increasing Importance of Training Awards in the Careers of Early-Stage Biomedical Academic Researchers,"Pickett, C. L.",Christopher L Pickett,2019-05-02,scientific communication and education,"Excessive competition for biomedical faculty positions has ratcheted up the need to accumulate some mix of high-quality publications and prestigious grants to move from a training position to university faculty. How universities value each of these attributes when considering faculty candidates is critical for understanding what is needed to succeed as academic faculty. In this study, I analyzed publicly available NIH grant information to determine the grants first-time R01 (FTR01) awardees held during their training period. Increases in the percentage of the FTR01 population that held a training award demonstrate these awards are becoming a more common component of a faculty candidates resume. The increase was largely due to an expansion of NIH K-series career development awards between 2000 and 2017. FTR01 awardees with a K01, K08, K23, or K99 award were overrepresented in a subset of institutions, whereas FTR01 awardees with F32 fellowships and those with no training award were evenly distributed across institutions. Finally, training awardees from top institutions were overrepresented in the faculty of the majority of institutions, echoing data from other fields where a select few institutions supply an overwhelming majority of the faculty for the rest of the field. These data give important insight into how trainees compete for NIH funding and faculty positions and how institutions prefer those with or without training awards."

D.; Brownson, R. C.; Glasgow, R. E.",Christopher  Knoepke,2019-05-03,scientific communication and education,"IntroductionThere has been an increasing focus on disseminating research findings, but less about practices specific to disseminating and engaging non-researchers. The present project sought to describe dissemination practices and engagement of stakeholders among dissemination & implementation (D&I) scientists.\n\nMethodsMethods to disseminate to and engage non-research stakeholders were assessed using an online survey sent to a broad, diverse sample of D&I scientists.\n\nResultsSurveys were received from 210 participants. The majority of respondents were from university or research settings in the U.S. (69%) or Canada (13%), representing a mix of clinical (28%) and community settings (34%). 26% had received formal training in D&I. Respondents indicated routinely engaging in a variety of dissemination-related activities, with academic journal publications (88%), conference presentations (86%), and reports to funders (74%) being the most frequent. Journal publication was identified as the most impactful on respondents careers (94%), but face-to-face meetings with stakeholders were rated as most impactful on practice or policy (40%). Stakeholder involvement in research was common, with clinical and community-based researchers engaging stakeholder groups in broadly similar ways, but with critical differences noted between researchers with greater seniority, those with more D&I training, those based in the US, and those in community vs, clinical research settings.\n\nConclusionsThere have been increases in stakeholder engagement, but few other practices since the 2012 survey, and some differences across subgroups. Methods to engage different stakeholders deserve more in-depth investigation. D&I researchers report substantial misalignment of incentives and behaviors related to dissemination to non-research audiences."
10.1101/622795,Is useful research data usually shared? An investigation of genome-wide association study summary statistics,"Thelwall, M.; Munafo, M.; Mas-Bleda, A.; Stuart, E.; Makita, M.; Weigert, V.; Keene, C.; Khan, N.; Drax, K.; Kousha, K.",Mike  Thelwall,2019-05-03,scientific communication and education,"Primary data collected during a research study is increasingly shared and may be re-used for new studies. To assess the extent of data sharing in favourable circumstances and whether such checks can be automated, this article investigates the summary statistics of primary human genome-wide association studies (GWAS). This type of data is highly suitable for sharing because it is a standard research output, is straightforward to use in future studies (e.g., for secondary analysis), and may be already stored in a standard format for internal sharing within multi-site research projects. Manual checks of 1799 articles from 2010 and 2017 matching a simple PubMed query for molecular epidemiology GWAS were used to identify 330 primary human GWAS papers. Of these, only 10.6% reported the location of a complete set of GWAS summary data, increasing from 4.3% in 2010 to 16.8% in 2017. Whilst information about whether data was shared was usually located clearly within a data availability statement, the exact nature of the shared data was usually unspecified. Thus, data sharing is the exception even in suitable research fields with relatively strong norms regarding data sharing. Moreover, the lack of clear data descriptions within data sharing statements greatly complicates the task of automatically characterising shared data sets."

In order for radiology residents to define new scopes of practice, however, additional fellowship training may in certain instances be warranted.\n\nMaterials and MethodsUsing the Canadian family medicine Enhanced Skills Program as a model, we conducted a Canada-wide survey of radiology residents to assess interest in additional fellowship training to expand their scope of practice.\n\nResultsOur results indicate that a majority of residents (69.2%) would like to routinely see patients in clinic and more than half (52%) are willing to undergo an additional year of fellowship to enhance their skill set. The most popular choices for such fellowships were sports medicine (22.8%), emergency medicine (19.6%) and vascular medicine (18.5%). In addition, a majority (52.9%) of residents felt capable of offering incidentaloma clinics without additional training beyond their core radiology residency.\n\nConclusionTraditional diagnostic and interventional radiology fellowships must be reconsidered to reflect the interests and capabilities of modern radiology trainees. Expansion of training options into the domain of direct patient management will likely prove popular among current residents."

Enteral nutrition via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and total parenteral nutrition (TPN) are major methods of ANH. Although both can be a life-prolonging treatments, Japan has recently come to view PEG as representative of unnecessary life-prolonging treatment. Consequently, TPN is often chosen for ANH instead. This study aimed to compare the long-term outcomes between PEG and TPN in the elderly.\n\nMethodsThis single-center retrospective cohort study identified 253 elderly patients with dysphagia who received enteral nutrition via PEG (n=180) or TPN (n=73) between January 2014 and January 2017. The primary outcome was survival time. Secondary outcomes were oral intake recovery, discharge to home, and the incidence of severe pneumonia and sepsis. We performed one-to-one propensity score matching using a 0.05 caliper. The Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards model were used to analyze the survival time between groups.\n\nResultsOlder patients with lower nutritional states, and severe dementia were more likely to receive TPN. Propensity score matching created 55 pairs. Survival time was significantly longer in the PEG group (median, 317 vs 195 days; P=0.017). The hazard ratio for PEG relative to TPN was 0.60 (95% confidence interval: 0.39-0.92; P=0.019). There were no significant differences between the groups in oral intake recovery and discharge to home. The incidence of severe pneumonia was significantly higher in the PEG group (50.9% vs 25.5%, P=0.010), whereas sepsis was significantly higher in the TPN group (10.9% vs 30.9%, P=0.018).\n\nConclusionsPEG was associated with a significantly longer survival time, a higher incidence of severe pneumonia, and a lower incidence of sepsis compared with TPN. These results can be used in the decision-making process before initiating ANH."

In 2009, the Chinese government introduced the Public Health Service Equalization (PHSE) program to restore the primary healthcare system in both essential medical care and public health service provision. This study evaluates the impact of management on hypertension control and evaluate how the program works.\n\nMethodsThe China National Health Development Research Centre (CNHDRC) undertook the Cross-sectional Health Service Interview Survey (CHSIS) of 62,097 people from primary healthcare reform pilot areas, across 17 provinces from eastern, central and western parts of China in 2014. This study is based on CHSIS survey responses from 9,607 participants, who had been diagnosed with hypertension. Regression analysis was used to estimate the impact of management provided under PHSE on hypertension control adjusting for the effects of other known determinants of hypertension control.\n\nFindingsUncontrolled hypertension was markedly lower among respondents, whose hypertension had been managed (22.4% in managed patients versus 31.1% in unmanaged patients, p<0.001). The interaction between PHSE management and the geographical region was highly significant in the model (p<0.001), suggesting that the PHSE program was not equally effective in all regions. Further analysis suggested that approximately 10% of regional variability was attributed to differences in administrative systems, as there was a significant association (P=0.014) between the presence of established regional Information Management Systems (IMS) and increased PHSE effectiveness. Insurance ({chi}2(5)=4.4, p=0.496) and Hukou ({chi}2(1)=2.4, p=0.121), which denote social security and urban rural differences, respectively, were not significant predictor of hypertension control.\n\nConclusionActive management of hypertension through the PHSE program was effective with 7.31 million more patients receiving hypertension control and equalization of service delivery was reflected to some extent. The link between established IMS and regional variability in the impact of PHSE highlights the importance of effective management of patient referrals and follow-up. Further investigation is needed to explore the factors that influence the effectiveness of PHSE."

I.",Simona  Trifu,2019-05-08,scientific communication and education,"This research has been carried out among climbing performers in Romania (a group of 60 climbers), starting from the desire to induce a state of preparation by watching a motivational short movie before performing a high difficulty route. The concept of preparation was related to the emotional impact of tonic or sensitive type (depending on the content of the movie) and the personality structure of the athletes, the conclusions drawn being in the area of optimization of performance by inducing an optimal state of preparation.\n\nPerformance climbers can have two main attitudes to impact with emotional stimuli in the competitive environment: tonic versus sensitivity. We propose the study of the correlations between the personality structure of the athletes, the emotional impact on stimulation, respectively the quality of the prepared state of state, as the active regulatory status.\n\nThe methodology included a batch of 60 climbers divided into two equal subgroups, before making a difficult route being allowed to view a movie with a tonic impact, or a sensitive impact. Personality was evaluated through five scales (Intelligence, Emotional Stability, Sensitivity, Imagination, and Perspicacity) while administering a Preparatory and Motivation Questionnaire.\n\nPeople with a high level of intelligence, imagination and perspicacity can more easily create attitudes, habits and habitual contests, as well as conduct appropriate to the concrete conditions of the competitive situation, while people with low emotional stability and sensitivity are more inclined towards a sensitive, labile, sensitive approach to the competitive situation. The research implies the necessity of organizing the mental operators with the purpose of suitability to the performance poor, in accordance with the tactical training of the athlete and with the personality traits.\n\nEmotional stimulation leads to affective participation, reception and awareness of favoring issues, stimulation of will, self-regulation of activity according to aspirations and strategies."

With three editions of the course successfully completed, we consider assessment of the courses social impact through analysis of the outcomes beyond knowledge acquisition to be of paramount importance.\n\nMethodology/Principal findingsTo this end, we have conducted a study using the Theory of Change theoretical approach, combined with an exploration of students experiences through in-depth interviews before, during and after taking the course. These testimonies have been analyzed and classified according to their type of result - outputs, outcomes and longer-term impacts - and distributed along three different levels: individual, collective (meso), and systemic change. Insights about intercultural communication in qualitative research are discussed in relation to the characteristics of UOC researchers and the class composition of faculty and students in the Middle East and North Africa countries (MENA) region.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceThis analysis fills a gap in the knowledge of social impact assessment through the establishment of a new methodological approach. The course has proven to be a valuable source of social capital and provided a space to build a network of professionals with a shared focus on how to treat CL in particular - a community of practice - and increase knowledge of other skin NTDs.\n\nAuthor summaryNeglected tropical diseases (NTDs) affecting the skin (Buruli ulcer, cutaneous leishmaniasis, post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis, leprosy, lymphatic filariasis, mycetoma, onchocerciasis, scabies and yaws) cause considerable disability, increase stigma and exacerbate poverty. Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is one of the most neglected NTDs. It has an estimated incidence of between 900,000 and 1.3 million new cases worldwide each year. A co-venture between the World Health Organization (WHO) and Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC) has developed an on-line interactive course entitled \""Clinical management of CL\"" to provide health personnel with thorough and up-to-date information on the various aspects of CL. Using a new methodological approach, we have conducted a social impact assessment of this training program in order to identify the different type and level of results. The most significant impact has been the mobilizing of students and professors from the different editions of the course in a community of practice, thereby enhancing learning, knowledge sharing and effectivity."

However, scientific authors change email address over time. Using a new method, we have calculated that approximately 18% of all authors contact email addresses in MEDLINE are invalid. While an unfortunate number, it is, however, lower than previously estimated. To mitigate this problem, institutions should provide email forwarding and scientific authors should use more stable email addresses. In fact, a steadily growing share already use free private email addresses: 32% of all new addresses in MEDLINE in 2018 were of this kind."

R.",Lauren A Maggio,2019-05-20,scientific communication and education,"Many medical education journals use Twitter to garner attention for their articles. The purpose of this study was to test the effects of tweeting on article page views and downloads.\n\nThe authors conducted a randomized trial using Academic Medicine articles published in 2015. Beginning in February through May 2018, one article per day was randomly assigned to a Twitter (case) or control group. Daily, an individual tweet was generated for each article in the Twitter group that included the title, #MedEd, and a link to the article. The link delivered users to the articles landing page, which included immediate access to the HTML full text and a PDF link. The authors extracted HTML page views and PDF downloads from the publisher. To assess differences in page views and downloads between cases and controls, a time-centered approach was used, with outcomes measured at 1, 7, and 30 days.\n\nIn total, 189 articles (94 cases, 95 controls) were analyzed. After days 1 and 7, there were no statistically significant differences between cases and controls on any metric. On day 30, HTML page views exhibited a 63% increase for cases (M=14.72, SD=63.68) when compared to controls (M=9.01, SD=14.34; incident rate ratio=1.63, p=0.01). There were no differences between cases and controls for PDF downloads on day 30.\n\nContrary to the authors hypothesis, only one statistically significant difference in page views between the Twitter and control groups was found. These findings provide preliminary evidence that after 30 days a tweet can have a small positive effect on article page views."

The publish-or-perish mentality of a research-intensive academic environment demands a certain skill set in its trainees. This selection criterion begins with the undergraduate research selection process, but what is the ideal skill set of an incoming student entering the research experience? The current landscape on this topic is bleak, with little examination of how students are chosen for these positions. We therefore conducted an analysis examining student selection methods, non-cognitive traits, emphasis on grades and medical school future ambitions. Our findings suggest that the top five student traits valued by principal investigators are: motivation, resilience, hard work, inquisitiveness and honesty. Surprisingly, emphasis on grades as a screening tool decreased as age of laboratory and frequency of publication increased. Additionally, we identified an inverse correlation between student interest in medical school and research supervisor interest in selecting the student for an undergraduate research experience. Taken together, our study culminates in a defined set of skills beneficial for an incoming student at the beginning of their research experience. We feel our findings will greatly facilitate the overall undergraduate student selection process in any academic environment."

Screening for it can reduce morbidity and mortality and improve women survival. Low level of knowledge and poor practice of breast cancer screening could be due to many factors. The aim of our study is to assess the knowledge, attitude and practice of breast cancer screening of women attending primary care centers in Abu Dhabi region.\n\nMethodA cross sectional study was done in 2017 using questionnaire about breast cancer awareness measure. Six primary health care centers were included which were located inside and outside Abu Dhabi island. Three hundred eighty three women participated in the study, between the age of 40-65.\n\nResultsThe facilities to screen for breast cancer screening is available, but it is still underutilized by women. Even though we found in our study that women had high level of knowledge about breast cancer (45.7%), but their practice for mammogram was poor (52.2%). We also found that, the higher the education, employment and family history of breast cancer women had better knowledge, with statistically significant result respectively (P=0.000), (P=0.018), (P=0.013), and women older than 49 had better practice of mammogram (P=0.000). In our study, we concluded that women who attend clinic located inside island of Abu Dhabi had better knowledge and practice compared to women attending clinics located outside the island who had better attitude.\n\nConclusionIn our study we found that despite having the modalities and services for breast cancer screening, it is still underutilized. Our population sample showed that women had good knowledge about breast cancer but poor practice for mammogram. Educational level, age and region all played role in their knowledge, attitude and practice. As primary care providers we are a big influencers on the society and the first contact to them, we can utilize this to spread the awareness. We can approach the women through social media, more campaigns and offering free mammogram to women who cannot afford paying for it. Spreading the awareness about screening will reduce the burden of breast cancer treatment on the health care system government too."

R.; Greeuw, T. d.; Vongxay, V.; Sychareun, V.; Broerse, J. E. W.",souksamone  Thongmixay,2019-06-01,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundSexual activity during youth is common in Lao PDR. However, young people seldom utilize sexual and reproductive health services and subsequently suffer from poor sexual and reproductive health. The aim of this qualitative study was to explore the barriers perceived by youth that prevent their access to sexual and reproductive health services.\n\nMethodsTwenty-nine semi-structured interviews were conducted with 22 participants aged 15-25 years, from urban and rural areas. A vignette was used during interviews with those who had no experience with sexual and reproductive health services. Additionally, seven semi-structured interviews were conducted with health providers from youth-friendly health clinics and from public sexual and reproductive health services. Data were analyzed using a thematic approach.\n\nResultsThe main barriers preventing young people from accessing sexual and reproductive health services were related to cognitive accessibility and psychosocial accessibility. The cognitive accessibility barriers were a lack of sexual knowledge and a lack of awareness of services. Perceived barriers in psychosocial accessibility were the feelings of shyness and shame caused by negative cultural attitudes to premarital sex, and the fear of parents finding out about visits to public sexual and reproductive health services, due to lack of confidentiality in the services and among health providers. In addition, the barriers of geographical accessibility, mainly insufficient availability of youth-friendly health clinics.\n\nConclusionTo improve access to services, a multi-component strategy is needed: promotion of youth-friendly health clinics; sexual education in schools; a formal referral system between schools and youth-friendly health clinics; and community support interventions. Prior to implementation, more research should be done on the applicability of these methods in the Laos context. Future research should try to determine the cost-effectiveness of youth-friendly health clinics integrated in a district hospital and stand-alone clinics, to provide insight into which form should be further developed."

K.; Via, A.",Rochelle E. Tractenberg,2019-06-02,scientific communication and education,"As the life sciences have become more data intensive, the pressure to incorporate the requisite training into life-science education and training programs has increased. To facilitate curriculum development, various sets of (bio)informatics competencies have been articulated; however, these have proved difficult to implement in practice. Addressing this issue, we have created a curriculum-design and -evaluation tool to support the development of specific Knowledge, Skills and Abilities (KSAs) that reflect the scientific method and promote both bioinformatics practice and the achievement of competencies. Twelve KSAs were extracted via formal analysis, and stages along a developmental trajectory, from uninitiated student to independent practitioner, were identified. Demonstration of each KSA by a performer at each stage was initially described (Performance Level Descriptors, PLDs), evaluated, and revised at an international workshop. This work was subsequently extended and further refined to yield the Mastery Rubric for Bioinformatics (MR-Bi). The MR-Bi was validated by demonstrating alignment between the KSAs and competencies, and its consistency with principles of adult learning. The MR-Bi tool provides a formal framework to support curriculum building, training, and self-directed learning. It prioritizes the development of independence and scientific reasoning, and is structured to allow individuals (regardless of career stage, disciplinary background, or skill level) to locate themselves within the framework. The KSAs and their PLDs promote scientific problem formulation and problem solving, lending the MR-Bi durability and flexibility. With its explicit developmental trajectory, the tool can be used by developing or practicing scientists to direct their (and their teams) acquisition of new, or to deepen existing, bioinformatics KSAs. The MR-Bi can thereby contribute to the cultivation of a next generation of bioinformaticians who are able to design reproducible and rigorous research, and to critically analyze results from their own, and others, work."

The analytic sample included patients with HBsAg-/anti-HBs+ serostatus. Anti-HBs titers were monitored, and cases defined as anti-HBs <10 mIU/mL during follow-up. Cases were matched one-to-all with controls with anti-HBs [&ge;]10 mIU/mL on the same event date and equivalent durations of biologic DMARDs treatment. Between-group characteristics were compared and risk factors for anti-HBs loss elucidated by conditional logistic regression analyses.\n\nResultsAmong 189 enrolled patients, 15 cases were matched with 211 controls. Risk factors associated with anti-HBs loss in multivariate analysis were low baseline anti-HBs titer (adjusted risk ratio = 0.96, 95% CI 0.93-0.99) and chronic kidney disease (adjusted risk ratio = 26.25, 95% CI 1.85-372.35). All cases had baseline anti-HBs titer <100 mIU/mL, and none developed HBV reactivation upon losing anti-HBs.\n\nConclusionsIn addition to low baseline anti-HBs titer, chronic kidney disease is also an independent risk factors associated with loss of anti-HBs in patients with HBsAg-/anti-HBs+ serostatus who receive biologic DMARDs to treat rheumatic diseases.\n\nSignificanceGiven that loss of anti-HBs precedes HBV reactivation and that the use of biologic DMARDs is increasingly widespread nowadays, understanding those who are at risk of loss of anti-HBs is an important and practical clinical issue.\n\nInnovationIn addition to low baseline anti-HBs titer, chronic kidney disease is also an independent risk factors associated with loss of anti-HBs in patients with HBsAg-/anti-HBs+ serostatus who receive biologic DMARDs to treat rheumatic diseases."

L.",Linda A Auker,2019-06-11,scientific communication and education,"Ecology requires training in data management and analysis. In this paper, we present data from the last 10 years demonstrating the increase in the use of R, an open-source programming environment, in ecology and its prevalence as a required skill in job descriptions. Because of its transparent and flexible nature, R is increasingly used for data management and analysis in the field of ecology. Consequently, job postings targeting candidates with a bachelors degree and a required knowledge of R have increased over the past ten years. We discuss our experiences teaching undergraduates R in two advanced ecology classes using different approaches. One approach, in a course with a field lab, focused on collecting, cleaning, and preparing data for analysis. The other approach, in a course without a field lab, focused on analyzing existing data sets and applying the results to content discussed in the lecture portion of the course. Our experiences determined that each approach had strengths and weaknesses. We recommend that above all, instructors of ecology and related subjects should be encouraged to include R in their coursework. Furthermore, instructors should be aware of the following: learning R is a separate skill from learning statistics; writing R assignments is a significant time sink for course preparation; and, there is a tradeoff between teaching R and teaching content. Determining how ones course fits into the curriculum and identifying resources outside of the classroom for students continued practice will ensure that R training is successful and will extend beyond a one-semester course."

J.",Sang-Sun  Han,2019-06-18,scientific communication and education,"The usage and the model variety of CBCT machine has been rapidly increasing, the dose evaluation of individual devices became an important issue. Patient dose from CBCT was assessed with two different methods, optically stimulated luminescence dosimeter (OSLD) measured and monte carlo (MC) simulation, in four different examination modes. Through the measurement process and obtained value, more practical and efficient method in acquiring CBCT effective dose would be suggested. Twenty-five OSLD were calibrated and equipped in human phantom of head and neck organs. This was exposed on 2 CBCT units, CS9300 (Carestream Dental LLC, Atlanta, Georgia) and RAYSCAN + (Ray Co. Ltd, Hwaseong-si, Korea) with 2 different examination modes. Dose recorded in dosimetry was obtained and organ dose as well as an effective dose were obtained in each units of examination modes. Those values were also calculated using MC software, PCXMC (STUK, Helsinki, Finland). The organ doses and effective doses from both methods were compared by each examination mode of individual unit. OSLD measured effective dose value was higher than that obtained with MC method in each examination mode, except dual jaw mode of CS9300. The percent difference of effective dose between the two methods were ranged from 4.0 to 14.3 %. The dose difference between the methods was decreased as the examination FOV decreased. Organ dose values were varied according to the method, while overall trend was similar in both methods. The organs showing high dose were mostly consistent in both methods. In this study, the effective dose obtained by OSLD measurement and MC simulation were compared and both methods were described in detail. Consequently, as relatively efficient and easy-handling method, we carefully suggest MC simulation for further dose evaluation."

The objective of this study was to obtain a flour produced from Cantaloupe melon seeds (Cucumis melo L. var. reticulatus) and to evaluate the viability of using the product as an ingredient in cake manufacturing. In this study, different formulations were developed: standard cake - 0% (F1) and cakes containing melon seed flour as substitute of wheat flour in 10% (F2), 30% (F3), and 50% (F4) concentrations. Centesimal composition, dietary fibre, structural and morphological characterization, determination of mineral composition, and evaluation of fatty acids profile in melon seed flour were carried out. To determine the overall acceptance of cake formulations, sensory analysis was performed with 135 non-trained panelists, which also included the identification of sensorial attributes using the Just About Right ideal scale test. The results showed that the melon seed flour has considerable nutritional value, with 18% proteins, 3% moisture, 4% ash, 30% lipids, and 35% dietary fibre. Melon flour also has a significantly high content of minerals, mainly phosphorus (1507.62 mg/100 g), potassium (957.35 mg/100 g), and magnesium (504.03 mg/100 g). The polyunsaturated fatty acid fraction was the most abundant in melon seed flour, with predominance of omega-6 fatty acids (17.95 g/mg of sample). Sensorial analysis disclosed good acceptance for formulations containing 10% and 30% of melon seed flour, with the 10% formulation being the most accepted. The research showed the feasibility of using the melon seed flour in cake production, as well as the possibility of using food waste in restaurants and food industries in order to adhere to sustainable production actions."

In this study we assessed the citation and altmetric advantage of bioRxiv, a preprint server for the biological sciences. We retrieved metadata of all bioRxiv preprints deposited between November 2013 and December 2017, and matched them to articles that were subsequently published in peer-reviewed journals. Citation data from Scopus and altmetric data from Altmetric.com were used to compare citation and online sharing behaviour of bioRxiv preprints, their related journal articles, and non-deposited articles published in the same journals. We found that bioRxiv-deposited journal articles received a sizeable citation and altmetric advantage over non-deposited articles. Regression analysis reveals that this advantage is not explained by multiple explanatory variables related to the article and its authorship. bioRxiv preprints themselves are being directly cited in journal articles, regardless of whether the preprint has been subsequently published in a journal. bioRxiv preprints are also shared widely on Twitter and in blogs, but remain relatively scarce in mainstream media and Wikipedia articles, in comparison to peer-reviewed journal articles."

Droughts are more common and sometime floods are experienced in various parts of the country. Being a tropical country, the inter-annual climate variability in Ethiopia is dominated by ENSO (ElNino and Southern Oscillation).\n\nIn this study, an attempt has been made to determine the occurrence of droughts and floods on monthly basis, by calculating the monthly SPI (Standardized Precipitation Index) using the available rainfall data during (1975-2005) at selected 26 stations that spread across the country. Based on the monthly SPI values computed, the droughts and floods of different intensities; extreme, severe and dry have been determined for all stations. The frequencies of the droughts and floods on monthly scale during the two rainy seasons, Belg (Feb-May) and Kiremt (Jun-Sep) seasons have been determined. For instance, during Belg season, there were 11 extreme (SPI < -2.0) droughts at Nazreth, 10 severe (SPI between -1.99 and -1.50) droughts at Diredawa and 14 moderate (SPI between -1.49 and -1.00) droughts at Kulumsa. Total number of droughts of all intensities over the study period is also highest (22) at Kulumsa and lowest (8) at Mekelle. Moreover, at Kulumsa both the numbers of droughts (22) and floods (22) during Belg are more, which shows that the rainfall variability is the highest at this station.\n\nThe association of the hydrological extremes during the two rainy seasons, belg and kiremt with the ENSO phases has also been examined, which forms a basis for the prediction of the occurrence of droughts (dry conditions) and floods (wet conditions) at individual stations using ENSO phases."

Based on an earlier proposal (Science 332:919 (2011)), we designed and implemented an IBW sequence in a university bioinformatics course.\n\nWe automatically generated unique, double-blinded, biologically plausible DNA sequences for each student. After guided instruction, students investigated sequences independently and responded through IBW writing assignments. IBW assignments were structured as condensed versions of a scientific research paper, and because the sequences were double blinded, they were also assessed as authentic science and evaluated on clarity and persuasiveness.\n\nWe piloted the approach in a seven-day workshop (35 students) at Perdana University Graduate School of Medicine in Kuala Lumpur. We observed dramatically improved student engagement and indirect evidence of improved learning outcomes over a similar workshop without IBW. Based on student feedback, initial discomfort with the writing component abated in favor of an overall positive response and increasing comfort with the high demands of student writing. Similarly encouraging results were found in a semester length undergraduate module at the National University of Singapore (155 students)."

There is substantial evidence that lifestyle modifications and drug intervention can prevent diabetes, therefore, an early identification of high risk individuals is important to design targeted prevention strategies. In this paper, we present an automatic tool that uses machine learning techniques to predict the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Data generated from an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was used to develop a predictive model based on the support vector machine (SVM). We trained and validated the models using the OGTT and demographic data of 1,492 healthy individuals collected during the San Antonio Heart Study. This study collected plasma glucose and insulin concentrations before glucose intake and at three time-points thereafter (30, 60 and 120 min). Furthermore, personal information such as age, ethnicity and body-mass index was also a part of the dataset. Using 11 oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) measurements, we have deduced 61 features, which are then assigned a rank and the top ten features are shortlisted using Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance feature selection algorithm. All possible combinations of the 10 best ranked features were used to generate SVM based prediction models. This research shows that an individuals plasma glucose levels, and the information derived therefrom have the strongest predictive performance for the future development of T2DM. Significantly, insulin and demographic features do not provide additional performance improvement for diabetes prediction. The results of this work identify the parsimonious clinical data needed to be collected for an efficient prediction of T2DM. Our approach shows an average accuracy of 96.80 % and a sensitivity of 80.09 % obtained on a holdout set."

The main objective of the present study was to assess the decayed, missing and filled deciduous and permanent teeth index and oral health behaviors among Portuguese adolescents.\n\nMaterials and methodsAn observational cross-sectional study was designed including a sample of 694 adolescents between the ages of 12 and 18 years old from five public schools in the Viseu and Guarda districts, Portugal. After a self-administered questionnaire was filled out by the participants, a clinical examination was carried out in order to assess oral status and dental caries identification. A descriptive analysis of the variables was performed using the Chi-square, Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests (p<0.05).\n\nResultsThe decayed, missing and filled permanent teeth index was 2.91{+/-}2.9 and the decayed, missing and filled deciduous teeth index was 1.10{+/-}1.4. Of the total sample, 73% consumed sugary food on a daily basis, 54.7% drank bottled water, 50.1% considered oral health good, 70.8% did not report pain in the last 12 months, but noticed gingival bleeding (51.5%). Most adolescents (79.4%) brushed their teeth daily and 60% did not use dental floss. Of the total sample, 96.4% had a dental appointment in the last 12 months, being 46.4% due to prevention treatments. The high decayed, missing and filled deciduous teeth index was associated with low maternal scholarship, male gender and living in a rural residence area (p<0.05). Adolescents who brush their teeth daily presented a good perception about their oral health (p<0.001).\n\nConclusionsPortuguese adolescents presented a low decayed, missing and filled deciduous and permanent teeth index index. The decayed, missing and filled deciduous teeth index was associated with sociodemographic factors. Oral hygiene habits were associated with self-perception of oral health. It is suggested that oral health promotion and prevention programs should be improved in schools in order to reduce the risks of oral disease development."

The recent acceleration of research into sexual orientation, gender identity, and mental health has generally been conducted without sufficient understanding of the opinions of sexual and gender minorities (SGM) toward this research. We surveyed 768 individuals, with an enrichment of LGBTQ+ stakeholders, for their opinions regarding genetic research of SGM and mental health. We found that the key predictors of attitudes toward genetic research specifically on SGM are 1) general attitudes toward genetic and mental health research 2) tolerance of SGM and associated behaviors 3) non-cisgender stakeholder status and 4) age of the respondent. Non-heterosexual stakeholder status was significantly associated with increased willingness to participate in genetic research if a biological basis for gender identity were discovered. We also found that non-stakeholders with a low tolerance for SGM indicated their SGM views would be positively updated if science showed a biological basis for their behaviors and identities. These findings represent an important first step in understanding and engaging the LGBTQ+ stakeholder community in the context of genetic research."

S.",Repon  Paul,2019-07-02,scientific communication and education,"In the absence of reliable data on the burden of hepatitis E virus (HEV) in high endemic countries, we established a hospital-based acute jaundice surveillance program in six tertiary hospitals in Bangladesh to estimate the burden of HEV infection among hospitalized acute jaundice patients aged [&ge;]14 years, identify seasonal and geographic patterns in the prevalence of hepatitis E, and examine factors associated with death.\n\nWe collected blood specimens from enrolled acute jaundice patients, defined as new onset of either yellow eyes or skin during the past three months of hospital admission, and tested for immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies against HEV, HBV and HAV. The enrolled patients were followed up three months after hospital discharge to assess their survival status; pregnant women were followed up three months after their delivery to assess pregnancy outcomes.\n\nFrom December2014 to September2017, 1925 patients with acute jaundice were enrolled; 661 (34%) had acute hepatitis E, 48 (8%) had hepatitis A, and 293 (15%) had acute hepatitis B infection. Case fatality among hepatitis E patients was 5% (28/589). Most of the hepatitis E cases were males (74%; 486/661), but case fatality was higher among females--12% (8/68) among pregnant and 8% (7/91) among non-pregnant women. Half of the patients who died with acute hepatitis E had co-infection with HAV or HBV. Of the 62 HEV infected mothers who were alive until the delivery, 9 (15%) had miscarriage/stillbirth, and of those children who were born alive, 19% (10/53) died, all within one week of birth.\n\nThis study confirms that hepatitis E is the leading cause of acute jaundice, leads to hospitalizations in all regions in Bangladesh, occurs throughout the year, and is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Effective control measures should be taken to reduce the risk of HEV infections including improvements in water quality, sanitation and hygiene practices and the introduction of HEV vaccine to high-risk groups.\n\nAuthor summaryIn the absence of reliable surveillance data on the burden of hepatitis E in endemic countries, we conducted a hospital-based acute jaundice surveillance study over a two and a half year period in six tertiary hospitals in Bangladesh. The study confirms that HEV infections occur throughout the year, and is a major (34%) cause of acute jaundice in tertiary hospitals in Bangladesh. Three-quarters of the acute hepatitis E cases were male, and HEV infection was higher among patients residing in urban areas than patients in rural areas (41% vs 32%). The overall case fatality rate of acute HEV infections in hospitals was 5%, but was higher among pregnant women (12%). Hepatitis E patients who died were more likely to have co-infection with HAV or HBV than the HEV infected patients who did not die. Fifteen percent of HEV infected mothers had miscarriage/stillbirth. Of the children who were born alive, 19% died, all within one week of birth. Considering the high burden of hepatitis E among hospitalized acute jaundice patients, Bangladesh could take control measures to reduce this risk including improvements in water quality, sanitation and hygiene practices and the introduction of hepatitis E vaccine in high-risk areas."

Khong,2019-07-04,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundChronic edema (CO) is a progressive, physically disfiguring and currently incurable condition. A multifaceted program has been recommended to manage the swelling. However, there is little evidence investigating patients perspectives following the program, particularly for those who have poor adherence or are disengaged.\n\nAimTo investigate the perceived challenges faced by disengaged participants with lower limb CO by identifying their enablers and barriers to participating in a Physiotherapy CO program.\n\nMethodAn exploratory qualitative approach was used. A purposive sampling strategy was adopted to recruit participants. Those with more than three months swelling and who had low adherence or attendance (disengaged) to the CO program were invited to participate. Semi-structured interviews with six participants from a CO clinic in a tertiary hospital were conducted. Data was thematically analyzed and findings in terms of enablers and barriers were subsequently reflected in the light of a theoretical framework.\n\nResultsAll six participants were morbidly obese (BMI 47 {+/-} 4 kg/m2) with multiple chronic comorbidities. Enablers and barriers detected included physical, psychological and social factors that interplay to present multidimensional challenges that influence the participants adjustment to managing their CO. For the disengaged participants in this study, their under-managed lower limb CO was a progression towards being housebound and having a gradually increasing level of disability.\n\nConclusionChronic edema, if left unmanaged, can have a profound debilitating impact on the individual permanently. Understanding the challenges faced by patients with lower limb CO has implications for developing a more patient-centered multidisciplinary approach to clinical practice and suggests the need for further research."

Sumra,2019-07-09,scientific communication and education,"The concept of the alpha female has become widely accepted as a form of female identity in the West. Though relationships between hormone concentrations and alpha-related traits have been demonstrated in alpha nonhuman primates, this has not been examined in the case of the human alpha female. The present study examined the associations of testosterone and cortisol, as well as 3 other hormones, estradiol, oxytocin, and progesterone derived from hair samples, with 11 variables related to the expression of the alpha female identity in a small non-random sample (N=126) of self-identified alpha and non-alpha women in North America. The results revealed statistically significant differences between these groups. When compared to non-alpha women, alpha women scored higher than non-alphas in measures for masculinity, leadership, low introversion, self-esteem, and exhibited lower hair cortisol levels. Alphas exhibited slightly lower estradiol and oxytocin levels than non-alphas though these differences were non-significant. Similar non-significant differences were also found in the case of sexual experience, sexual dominance, testosterone, and progesterone. Though cortisol was not associated with masculine traits, it was positively and significantly associated with leadership. Cortisol was also negatively and significantly associated with strength and a measure for femininity. Progesterone, testosterone, and oxytocin were positively and significantly associated with enjoying sex, as was oxytocin with playing a dominant role in sexual encounters. Surprisingly, testosterone was not associated with alpha status nor with the measure of masculinity, and estradiol was not associated with any of the variables. The results imply that women who identify as alpha may experience less physiological stress than non-alpha females as measured by their lower cortisol levels."

Y.; Ahmed, M. E.; Mehari, A. B.",Zerihun  Yohannes  Amare,2019-07-10,scientific communication and education,"Child malnutrition is an underlying cause for almost half (45%) of child deaths, particularly in low socioeconomic communities of developing countries like Ethiopia. Globally, in 2018, 149 million children under five were stunted and over 49 million children were wasted. In Ethiopia, from the year 2005 to 2016, there is a decrease in stunting from 47% to 39%, but the prevalence of wasting changed little over the same time period (11% to 10%). Despite efforts made by the Ethiopian government and improvements in reducing malnutrition, the current rate of progress is not fast enough to have reached the global target by 2025.The aim of this study was to examine the determinants of nutritional status among children under five in Ethiopia. This study used data from 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Heath Survey (EDHS) to examine determinants of nutritional status among children under five (0-59 months). This study used stunting and wasting as dependent variables for the analysis. Childrens, mothers, households, and environmental characteristics were used as determinant variables. Children not alive, and other missing values were considered as missing and was not included in the analyses. Sample weights were applied in all analysis due to the two stage cluster sampling design in the EDHS datasets. Multicollinearity among independent variables were checked. Logistic regression was used to analyse the determinants of nutritional status among under five age children. Bivariate analysis was also used to analyse the association between the dependent and independent variables. The chi-square test used to see the significance of association. The level of significance for the analysis was p<0.05. Age, and sex of child, educational status and body mass index, and short stature of mothers, residence, region, wealth quintile, toilet facilities and fuel types of households have significant association with stunting and wasting. However, mothers short stature has significant association with only stunting. The study found child, maternal, household and environmental characteristics were significantly associated with stunting and wasting among of children under five. This implies a multi-sectorial and multidimensional approach is important to address malnutrition in Ethiopia."

A.; Das, S.; Kumar, B.",Luthful  Alahi  Kawsar,2019-07-11,scientific communication and education,"Acute respiratory infection (ARI) and diarrhoea are two major causes of child morbidity and mortality in Bangladesh. National and regional level prevalence of ARI and diarrhoea are calculated from nationwide surveys; however, prevalence at micro-level administrative units (say, district and sub-district) is not possible due to lack of sufficient data. In such case, small area estimation (SAE) methods can be applied by combining a survey data with a census data. Using a SAE method for dichotomous response variable, this study aims to estimate the proportions of under-5 children experienced with ARI and diarrhoea separately as well as either ARI or diarrhoea within a period of two-week preceding the survey. The ARI and diarrhoea information extracted from Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey 2011 are used to develop a random effect logistic model for each of the indicators, and then the prevalence is estimated adapting the World Bank SAE approach for the dichotomous response variable using the 5% data of the Census 2011. The estimated prevalence of each indicator significantly varied by district and sub-district (1.4-11.3% for diarrhoea, 2.2-11.8% for ARI and 4.3-16.5% for ARI/diarrhoea at sub-district level). In a number of districts and sub-district, the proportions are found double the national level. District and sub-district levels spatial distributions of the indicators might help the policy makers to identify the vulnerable disaggregated and remote hotspots. Particularly, aid industries can provide effective interventions at the highly vulnerable spots to overcome the gaps between micro and macro level administrative units."

Document screening and data extraction were performed independently by four researchers. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the SYRCLEs risk of bias tool. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS23.\n\nResultsA total of 2764 animal studies were included. Of the studies, 984 were published in English and 1780 were in Chinese. The citation frequency of more than 90% of the included studies was less than 5. The results of methodological quality assessment showed that 36.36% (8/22) of the sub-items were rated as \""low risk\"" in more than 50% of the included studies, of which 75% (6/8) were rated as \""low risk\"" in more than 80% of the included studies. A total of 59.09% (13/22) of the sub-items were rated as \""low risk\"" in less than 30% of the included studies, of which 92.31% (12/13) were rated as \""low risk\"" in less than 10% of the included studies. The incidence of \""low risk\"" Chinese studies regarding performance bias, detection bias and reporting bias were lower than English studies. For foreign studies, more attention should be paid to selection bias, attrition bias, and reporting bias.\n\nConclusionWe identified limitations in the methodological quality of animal experiment studies published in China and abroad. We therefore suggest that it is necessary to take targeted measures to popularize the SYRCLEs risk of bias tool to effectively improve the design and implementation of animal experiments, and guide study development."

A.",Jeffrey A Lewis,2019-07-12,scientific communication and education,"Microbial fermentation is a common form of metabolism that has been exploited by humans to great benefit. Industrial fermentation currently produces a myriad of products ranging from biofuels to pharmaceuticals. About one third of the worlds food is fermented, and the brewing of fermented beverages in particular has an ancient and storied history. Because fermentation is so intertwined with our daily lives, the topic is easily relatable to students interested in real-world applications for microbiology. Here, we describe the curriculum for an inquiry-based laboratory course that combines yeast molecular ecology and brewing. The rationale for the course is to compare commercial Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strains, which have been domesticated through thousands of generations of selection, with wild yeast, where there is growing interest in their potentially unique brewing characteristics. Because wild yeast are so easy to isolate, identify, and characterize, this is a great opportunity to present key concepts in molecular ecology and genetics in a way that is relevant and accessible to students. We organized the course around three main modules: isolation and identification of wild yeast, phenotypic characterization of wild and commercial ale yeast strains, and scientific design of a brewing recipe and head-to-head comparison of the performance of a commercial and wild yeast strain in the brewing process. Pre and post assessment showed that students made significant gains in the learning objectives for the course, and students enjoyed connecting microbiology to a real-world application."

We assembled a dataset of 74,239 articles, 5,405 of which had a preprint, published in 39 journals. Based on log-linear regression and random-effects meta-analysis, articles with a preprint had a 51% higher Altmetric Attention Score and 37% more citations compared to articles without one. These associations were independent of several other article- and author-level variables (e.g., scientific subfield and last author publication age) and unrelated to journal-level variables such as access model and Impact Factor.

Our objective was to evaluate the effect of using a wireless audio headset device on communication, efficiency and patient outcome in robotic surgery.\n\nMethods and findingsA prospective controlled trial of team members participating in gynecologic and urologic robotic procedures between January and March 2015. In the first phase, all surgeries were performed without headsets (control), followed by the intervention phase where all team members used the wireless headsets. Noise levels were measured during both phases. After each case, all team members evaluated the quality of communication, performance, teamwork and mental load using a validated 14-point questionnaire graded on a 1-10 scale. Higher overall scores indicated better communication and efficiency. Clinical and surgical data of all patients in the study were retrieved, analyzed and correlated with the survey results.\n\nThe study included 137 procedures, yielding 843 questionnaires with an overall response rate of 89% (843/943). Self-reported communication quality was better in cases where headsets were used (113.0 {+/-} 1.6 vs. 101.4 {+/-} 1.6; p < .001). Use of headsets reduced the percentage of time with a noise level above 70 dB at the console (8.2% {+/-} 0.6 vs. 5.3% {+/-} 0.6, p < .001), but had no significant effect on length of surgery nor postoperative complications.\n\nConclusionsThe use of wireless headset devices improved quality of communication between team members and reduced the peak noise level in the robotic OR."

The ARRIVE guidelines were originally developed in 2010 to improve the reporting of animal research. They consist of a checklist of information to include in publications describing in vivo experiments to enable others to scrutinise the work adequately, evaluate its methodological rigour, and reproduce the methods and results. Despite considerable levels of endorsement by funders and journals over the years, adherence to the guidelines has been inconsistent, and the anticipated improvements in the quality of reporting in animal research publications have not been achieved.\n\nHere we introduce ARRIVE 2019. The guidelines have been updated and information reorganised to facilitate their use in practice. We used a Delphi exercise to prioritise the items and split the guidelines into two sets, the ARRIVE Essential 10, which constitute the minimum requirement, and the Recommended Set, which describes the research context. This division facilitates improved reporting of animal research by supporting a stepwise approach to implementation. This helps journal editors and reviewers to verify that the most important items are being reported in manuscripts. We have also developed the accompanying Explanation and Elaboration document that serves 1) to explain the rationale behind each item in the guidelines, 2) to clarify key concepts and 3) to provide illustrative examples. We aim through these changes to help ensure that researchers, reviewers and journal editors are better equipped to improve the rigour and transparency of the scientific process and thus reproducibility."

This practice may entail severe consequences for physical and mental health in this population. Research on the subject is scarce. The aim of our study was to describe the psychopathological background of a sample of HIV positive MSM who practiced slamsex during the previous year and compare the physical and psychological symptoms between these participants and those who practiced sexualized drug use (SDU) or chemsex without slamsex.\n\nDesign and MethodsParticipants (HIV-positive MSM) were recruited from the U-Sex study in 22 HIV clinics in Madrid during 2016-17. All participants completed an anonymous cross-sectional survey on sexual behaviour and recreational drug use. The present analysis is based on HIV-positive MSM who had practiced SDU.\n\nResultsThe survey sample comprised 742 participants. Of all the participants who completed the survey, 216 (29.1%) practiced chemsex, and of these, 34 (15.7%) had practiced slamsex. Participants who practiced slamsex were more likely to have current psychopathology (depression, anxiety and drug related disorders) than chemsex users. In addition, participants who practiced slamsex had more high-risk sexual behaviours, polydrug use and were more often diagnosed with sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and hepatitis C than those who did not inject drugs. Compared with patients who did not inject drugs, patients who engaged in slamsex showed more severe drug related symptoms (withdrawal and dependence), symptoms of severe intoxication (loss of consciousness), and severe psychopathological symptoms related to SDU, such as paranoid thoughts and suicidal behaviour.\n\nConclusionSlamsex (intravenous SDU) is closely associated with current psychiatric disorders and severe drug-related and psychiatric symptoms."

10.1101/703322,Association between Japanese community health workers willingness to continue service and two categories of motives: altruistic and self-oriented,"Taguchi, A.; Murayama, H.; Ono, K.",Atsuko  Taguchi,2019-07-15,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundAs population aging progresses, volunteers in health field are expected to play a key role in health promotion and disease prevention, which may improve community residents health and well-being and at the same time help curve healthcare cost. The objective of this study is to examine the effects of self-oriented motives and altruistic motives as explanatory factors for Japanese Community Health Workers (CHWs) desire to continue their service. Unraveling the relative effects of these two types of motivation on CHW retention may lead to policy and practical implications for recruiting, training, and supporting CHWs in Japan. Haddad (2007) observed that citizens in Japan generally have a sense of governmental and individual responsibility for dealing with social problems. Applying these insights to CHWs, we hypothesize that altruistic motives have more potent influence on volunteers willingness to continue to serve than self-oriented motives.\n\nMethodsThree cities in Shiga prefecture, Japan agreed to participate in the study. Anonymous, self-administered questionnaire was mailed to all CHWs who work in the three communities. The survey data were collected in March and April, 2013. A total of 417 questionnaires were mailed to CHWs, of which 346 were completed and returned (response rate 83.0%). Nine questionnaires missing response to the question concerning willingness to continue serving were removed from the analysis. The final analysis used 337 questionnaires (effective response rate 80.8%).\n\nResultsOne hundred ninety-nine (59.1%) of the respondents answered the question about willingness to continue CHW affirmatively, and 138 (40.9%) negatively. Controlling for other relevant factors, those with self-oriented motives in serving as CHWs were more likely to state they are willing to continue to serve (OR:1.54, confidence interval 1.00-2.37) than those without such motives. Contrary to our hypothesis, the effect of altruistic motives on respondents willingness to continue serving as CHWs was slightly larger than that of self-oriented motives; the odds ratio was 1.56(confidence interval 1.08-2.27).\n\nConclusionOne practical implication of the research is that learning more about the twin motives, self-oriented and altruistic, of volunteers and tailoring the content of CHW training to address those motives may be beneficial."

B.; Koka, E.; Mugara, T.; Swiswa, S.",Mark  Caudell,2019-07-15,scientific communication and education,"The nutritional and economic potentials of livestock systems are compromised by the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance. A major driver of resistance is the misuse and abuse of antimicrobial drugs. The likelihood of misuse may be elevated in low- and middle-income countries where limited professional veterinary services and laissez faire access to drugs are assumed to promote non-prudent practices (e.g., self-administration of drugs). The extent of these practices, as well as the knowledge and attitudes motivating them, are largely unknown within most agricultural communities in low- and middle-income countries. The main objective of this study was to document dimensions of knowledge, attitudes and practices related to antimicrobial use and antimicrobial resistance in livestock systems and identify the livelihood factors associated with these dimensions. A mixed-methods ethnographic approach was used to survey households keeping layers in Ghana (N=110) and Kenya (N=76), pastoralists keeping cattle, sheep, and goats in Tanzania (N=195), and broiler farmers in Zambia (N=198), and Zimbabwe (N=298). Across countries, we find that it is individuals who live or work at the farm who draw upon their knowledge and experiences to make decisions regarding antimicrobial use and related practices. Input from animal health professionals is rare and antimicrobials are sourced at local, privately owned agrovet drug shops. We also find that knowledge, attitudes, and particularly practices significantly varied across countries, with poultry farmers holding more knowledge, desirable attitudes, and prudent practices compared to pastoralists households. Multivariate models showed that variation is related to several factors, including education, disease dynamics on the farm, and sources of animal health information. Study results emphasize that interventions to limit antimicrobial resistance must be founded upon a bottom-up understanding of antimicrobial use at the farm-level given limited input from animal health professionals and under-resourced regulatory capacities within most low- and middle-income countries. Establishing this bottom-up understanding across cultures and production systems will inform the development and implementation of the behavioral change interventions to combat AMR globally."

R.; Peter, D.",Pascal  Agbadi,2019-07-19,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundVarious aspects of disrespect and abusive maternity care have received scholarly attention because of frequent reports of the phenomenon in most healthcare facilities globally, especially in low- and middle-income countries. However, the perspectives of skilled providers on respectful maternal care have not been extensively studied. Midwives knowledge of respectful maternity care is critical in designing any interventive measures to address the menace of disrespect and abuse in maternity care. Therefore, the present study sought to explore the views of midwives on respectful maternity care at a Teaching Hospital in Kumasi, Ghana.\n\nMethodsPhenomenological qualitative research design was employed in the study. Data were generated through individual in-depth interviews, which were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data saturation was reached with fifteen midwives. Open Code 4.03 was used to manage and analyse the data.\n\nFindingsThe midwives understanding of respectful maternity care was comprised of the following components: non-abusive care, consented care, confidential care, non-violation of childbearing womens basic human rights, and non-discriminatory care. Probing questions to solicit midwives opinions on an evidenced-based component of respectful maternity care generated little information, suggesting that the midwives have a gap in knowledge regarding this component of respectful maternity care.\n\nConclusionMidwives reported an understanding of most components of respectful maternity care, but their gap in knowledge on evidenced-based care requires policy attention and in-service training. To understand the extent to which this gap in knowledge can be generalized for midwives across Ghana to warrant a redesign of the national midwifery curriculum, the authors recommend a nationwide cross-sectional quantitative study."

In 2014, 42% of Ghanaian pregnant women aged 15-49 years were anemic (<11.0g/dl) but information on the determinants of anemia, particularly dietary diversity during the critical third trimester of pregnancy is limited. We assessed the association between determinants and anemia among pregnant women in northern Ghana.\n\nWe employed a cross-sectional design involving 624 pregnant women ([&ge;]20 weeks of gestation) attending four antenatal care (ANC) health facilities ~25 kilometres north of Tamale, Ghana between July and August 2017. Hemoglobin concentration (measured using Hemocue HB 301) was classified as severe, moderate, or mild. Other data included socio-demographic characteristics, malaria prevention, deworming, and iron/folate tablet use. The FAO Minimum Dietary Diversity (MDD-W) metric was used to categorize women into \""inadequate\"" (MDD-W <5 food groups) and \""adequate\"" (MDD-W [&ge;]5). Logistic regression models were used to determine the association between moderate/severe anemia (Hb<9.0g/dl) and mild anemia (9.0-10.9g/dl), or with  no anemia ([&ge;]11.0g/dl) using STATA 14 software.\n\nOf 624 women sampled, hemoglobin data were available for 601. The mean age was 27.81{+/-}0.25 years, gestational age was 31.93{+/-}0.13 weeks, ANC attendance was 3.89{+/-}0.07; Hb concentration was 9.73g/dl{+/-}0.07, and MDD-W index for ten food groups was 5.33{+/-}0.04. Anemia (Hb<11.0g/dl) was observed in 74.8% of women (moderate/severe anemia=33.4% and mild anemia=41.4%). Using adjusted logistic regression, women who received deworming medication had lesser odds of being moderate/severe anemic (aOR=0.51, P=0.021). While women who were engaged in other occupation (herdsmen) and no previous parity had higher odds of being moderate/severe anemic (aOR=2.90, P=0.042) and (aOR=2.13, P=0.004) respectively. Moderate/severe anemia was not statistically associated with MDD-W, nor with socioeconomic status/wealth index. Conclusion, anemia in pregnancy was nearly twice that of Ghana as a whole. Deworming medication was found to be protective intervention for anemia during pregnancy."

Respondents indicated that total number of publications, number of publications per year, and journal name recognition were the most valued factors in RPT. Older and tenured respondents (most likely to serve on RPT committees) were less likely to value journal prestige and metrics for publishing, while untenured respondents were more likely to value these factors.

This paper deals with local response to the CCC, and explores, through qualitative analysis of focus group data sets, why communities see CCC in a positive light. The responses of 562 focus group participants in seven villages with CCC and seven neighbouring control villages without CCC are assessed. These data confirm that CCC are compatible with community values concerning access to, and family care for, the sick. Mixed reactions are reported in the case of \""safe burial\"", a process that directly challenged ritual activity seen as vital to maintaining good relations between socially-enclaved rural families. Land acquisitions to build CCC prompted divided responses. This reflects problems about land ownership unresolved since colonial times between communities and government. The study provides insights into how gaps in understanding between international Ebola responders and local communities can be bridged.\n\nAuthor SummaryControl of Ebola Virus Disease requires facilities where patients can be isolated and treated safely, without risk to medical personnel or family members. In the 2014-15 Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone emphasis was at first placed on large field hospitals known as Ebola Treatment Centers (ETC). These were often located far from areas where new cases were being discovered. Patients were distrustful of their purpose and slow to report, and the disease continued to spread. Six months into the epidemic a new approach was tried, based on much smaller and more rapidly constructed centres (Community Care Centres (CCC) located where new cases were occurring. This paper examines community reactions to the CCC. There was a much greater sense of community ownership of these small, localised centres, and reporting times improved. Families were able easily to visit and observe activities, even though restricted from crossing red lines. The staff were often local and provided trustworthy information on the progress of patients. Families were able to prepare home food for patients, and this was thought to improve their morale and chances of survival. CCC were also appreciated for treating other disease, and not only Ebola. Referral of patients to ETC was easier to accept when the outcome of an Ebola blood test was known. There were some differences of opinion over \""safe burial\"" procedures and acquisition of sites for the CCC, but on balance CCC were well accepted by communities, and were seen locally as a positive development in Ebola control."

M.",Ian A Fladie,2019-07-30,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundScientific research is replete with poor accessibility to data, materials, and protocol, which limits the reproducibility of a study. Transparency with regard to materials, protocols, and raw data sets enhances reproducibility by providing the critical information necessary to verify, replicate, and resynthesize research findings. The extent to which transparency and reproducibility exist in the field of orthopaedics is unclear. In our study, we aimed to evaluate transparency and reproducibility-related characteristics of randomly sampled publications in orthopaedic journals.\n\nMethodsWe used the National Library of Medicine catalog to identify English language and MEDLINE-indexed orthopaedic journals. From the 74 journals meeting our inclusion criteria, we randomly sampled 300 publications using a refined PubMed search that were published between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2018. Two investigators were trained for data extraction and analysis. Both investigators were blinded and independently extracted data from the 300 studies.\n\nResultsOur initial search yielded 68,102 publications, from which we drew a random sample of 300 publications. Of these 300 publications, 286 were screened for empirical data and 14 were inaccessible. For analysis purposes, we excluded publications without empirical data. Of the 182 with empirical data, 13 studies (7.1%) included a data availability statement, 9 (4.9%) reported materials were available, none (0.0%) provided analysis scripts, 2 (1.1%) provided access to the protocol used, 5 (2.7%) were preregistered, and only 2 (1.1%) provided a statement about being a replicated study.\n\nConclusionsComponents necessary for reproducibility are lacking in orthopaedic surgery journals. The vast majority of publications did not provide data or material availability statements, protocols, or analysis scripts, and had no preregistration statements. Intervention is needed to improve reproducibility in the field of orthopaedics. The current state of reproducibility in orthopaedic surgery could be improved by combined efforts from funding agencies, authors, peer reviewers, and journals alike.\n\nLevel of EvidenceN/A"

R.",Eric  Tellier,2019-07-31,scientific communication and education,"ObjectiveTo predict the risk of drowning along the surf beaches of Gironde, southwestern France.\n\nMethodsData on rescues and drownings were collected from the Medical Emergency Center of Gironde (SAMU 33). Seasonality, holidays, weekends, weather, and sea conditions were considered potentially predictive. Logistic regression models were fitted with data from 2011-2013 and used to predict 2015-2017 events employing weather and ocean forecasts.\n\nResultsAir temperature, wave parameters, seasonality, and holidays were associated with drownings. Prospective validation was performed on 617 days, covering 232 events (rescues and drownings) reported on 104 different days. The area under the curve (AUC) of the daily risk prediction model (combined with 3-day forecasts) was 0.82 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.79-0.86]. The AUC of the 3-hour step model was 0.85 (95% CI 0.81-0.88).\n\nConclusionsDrowning events along the Gironde surf coast can be anticipated up to 3 days in advance.Preventative messages and rescue preparations could be increased as the forecast risk increased, especially during the off-peak season, when the number of available rescuers is low."

A.; Fatoye, F.",Opeyemi  Idowu,2019-08-02,scientific communication and education,"IntroductionLow Back Pain is a common public health problem worsened by maladaptive beliefs and incongruent back pain behaviour. It is imperative to develop outcome measures to assess these beliefs among patients with chronic LBP. This study aimed to cross-culturally adapt and determine the psychometric properties of the Yoruba version of the ODI (ODI-Y).\n\nMethodsThe ODI-Y was cross-culturally adapted following the process involving forward translation, synthesis, backward translation, expert review, and pilot testing. One hundred and thirty-six patients with chronic LBP took part in the validation of the ODI-Y; 86 of these individuals took part in the test-retest reliability (within 1-week interval) of the translated instrument. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the ODI-Y were determined using the Cronbachs alpha and intra-class correlation. Other psychometric properties explored included the factor structure and fit, convergent validity, standard error of measurement and the minimal detectable change.\n\nResultsThe mean age of the respondents was 50.5{+/-}10.6years. The ODI-Y showed a high internal consistency, with a Cronbachs alpha () of 0.81. Test-retest of the Yoruba version of the ODI within 1-week interval yielded an Intra-Class Correlation coefficient of 0.89. The ODI-Y yielded a two-factor structure which accounted for 51.7% of the variance but showed poor fit. Convergent of ODI-Y with the visual analogue scale was moderate (r=0.30; p=0.00). The standard error of measurement and minimal detectable change of the ODI-Y were 2.0 and 5.5.\n\nConclusionsThe ODI was adapted into the Yoruba language and proved to have a good factor structure and psychometric properties that replicated the results of other obtainable versions. We recommend it for use among Yoruba speaking patients with low-back pain."

Yet, doubts remain about the reliability of such data, in particular when acquired by school children. We built upon an ongoing CS program - Oak bodyguards - to assess the ability of European schoolchildren to accurately estimate the strength of biotic interactions in terrestrial ecosystems. We used standardized protocols to estimate predation rates on artificial caterpillars and insect herbivory on oak leaves and compared estimates made by school children, trained and untrained professional scientists (with no or limited expertise in predation or herbivory assessment). Compared to trained scientists, both schoolchildren and untrained professional scientists overestimated predation rates, but assessments made by the latter were more consistent. School children overestimated insect herbivory, as did untrained professional scientists. Thus, raw data acquired by school children participating in CS programs cannot be used and require several quality checks. However, such data are of no less value than data collected by untrained professional scientists and can be calibrated for bias."

G.; Wungak, Y.; Abubakar, A.",Yakubu  Joel  Atuman,2019-08-08,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundFoot and mouth disease (FMD) is one of the most economically important transboundary animal diseases with devastating consequence on livestock production and wildlife conservation. The objectives of the study were: to determine the seroprevalence of FMDV in wildlife and cattle and identify circulating FMDV serotypes in wildlife and identify potential risk factors that will contribute to transmission of the disease at the wildlife-livestock interface in Yankari Game Reserve and Sumu Wildlife Park in Bauchi State, Nigeria.\n\nMethodsBlood samples were collected between 2013 to 2015 from some wildlife and cattle respectively within and around Yankari Game Reserve (YGR) and Sumu Wildlife Park (SWP) in Bauchi State, Nigeria. The Wild animals were immobilized for blood collection using a combination of Etorphine Hydrochloride (M99(R) Kruger-Med South Africa) at 0.5-2 mg/kg and Azaperone (Stresnil(R), Janssen Pharmaceuticals (Pty.) Ltd., South Africa) at 0.1 mg/kg using a Dan-Inject(R) rifle (Dan-Inject APS, Sellerup Skovvej, Denmark) fitted with 3 ml dart syringe and for reversal, Naltrexone (Trexonil(R) Kruger-Med South Africa) at 1.5 mg IM was used, cattle were restrained by the owners for blood collection. Harvested Sera from blood were screened for presence of Antibodies against FMDV using prioCHECK(R) 3 ABC NSP ELISA kit and positive samples from wildlife were serotyped using Solid-Phase Competitive ELISA, (IZSLER Brescia-Italy). Data obtained were analysed using Graphpad Prism version 7.\n\nResultsThe results showed that 197 (65.7%) of the 300 serum samples from cattle and 13 (24.5%) of the 53 serum samples from wildlife tested positive for antibodies to the highly conserved non-structural 3-ABC protein of FMDV and statistically significant (P <0.05). Classification of cattle into breed and sex showed that detectable antibodies to FMDV were higher (P <0.05) in White Fulani 157 (72.8%) than red Bororo 23 (39.7%) and Sokoto Gudali 17 (33.3%) breeds of cattle whereas in females detectable FMDV antibodies were higher (P <0.05) 150 (72.8%) than in males 47 (50.0%). In the wildlife species, antibodies to FMDV were detected in waterbuck 2 (28.6%), elephant 1 (25.0%), wildebeest 4 (33.3%) and eland 6 (25.0%). Four serotypes of FMDV: O, A, SAT-1 and SAT-2 were detected from the 3-ABC positive reactors in waterbuck, elephant, wildebeest and eland. Contact of wildlife and cattle during utilization of the rich resources in the conservation areas is a potential risk factor for the spread of FMDV in the study area.\n\nConclusionsPresence of FMDV antibodies in cattle and some wildlife were observed and serotypes of FMDV: O, A, SAT-1 and SAT-2 were detected from the 3-ABC positive reactors in some of the wildlife. The study highlights the need for active surveillance of FMDV in wildlife and pastoral cattle within and around wildlife conservation areas in Nigeria. FMD surveillance system, control and prevention program that targets wildlife and livestock at the wildlife-livestock interface level will be beneficial to the livestock industry and wildlife conservation goals in Bauchi State, Nigeria.\n\nAuthor summaryFoot and mouth disease (FMD) is an important trans-boundary viral disease of both domestic and wild cloven hoofed animals characterized by high morbidity with devastating consequence on the livestock worldwide. Despite the endemic nature of FMD in Nigeria, little is known about the epidemiology of the disease at the wildlife-livestock interface level. To address this gap, blood samples were collected between 2013 to 2015 from some wildlife and cattle respectively within and around Yankari Game Reserve (YGR) and Sumu Wildlife Park (SWP) in Bauchi State, Nigeria. Wild animals were immobilized using a combination of Etorphine Hydrochloride (M99(R) Kruger-Med South Africa) at 0.5-2 mg/kg and Azaperone (Stresnil(R), Janssen Pharmaceuticals (Pty.) Ltd., South Africa) at 0.1 mg/kg using a Dan-Inject(R) rifle (Dan-Inject APS, Sellerup Skovvej, Denmark) fitted with 3 ml dart syringe and for reversal, Naltrexone (Trexonil(R) Kruger-Med South Africa) at 1.5 mg IM was used, cattle were restrained by the owners for blood collection. Harvested Sera from blood were screened for presence of Antibodies against FMDV using prioCHECK(R) 3 ABC NSP ELISA kit and positive samples were serotyped using Solid-Phase Competitive ELISA, (IZSLER Brescia-Italy). Out of the 300 and 53 sera collected from cattle and wildlife 197 (65.7%) and 13 (24.5%) (P <0.05) respectively tested positive for antibodies to the highly conserved non-structural 3-ABC protein of FMDV by the FMDV-NS blocking ELISA. Classification of cattle into breed and sex showed that detectable antibodies to FMDV were higher (P <0.05) in White Fulani 157 (72.8%) than red Bororo 23 (39.7%) and Sokoto Gudali 17 (33.3%) breeds of cattle whereas in females detectable FMDV antibodies were higher (P <0.05) 150 (72.8%) than in males 47 (50.0%).

Four serotypes of FMDV: O, A, SAT-1 and SAT-2 were detected from the 3-ABC positive reactors in waterbuck, elephant, wildebeest and elands. The results showed presence of antibodies to FMDV in some wildlife and cattle and suggest that wildlife could equally play an important role in the overall epidemiology of FMD in Nigeria. FMD surveillance system, control and prevention program should be intensified in the study area."

Studies have explored the association between infants delivered by caesarean section and their later life risk of obesity, in many countries outside Africa. As a result of the increasing caesarean section and obesity rates in South Africa, we investigated the association in this country.\n\nMethodsThis was a retrospective analysis of data that were collected from a prospective South African birth cohort (Birth to Twenty Plus), established in 1990. A total of 889 young adults aged 21-24 years were included in the analysis. Multiple logistic regression models were fitted to assess the association between mode of delivery and early adulthood obesity.\n\nResultsOf the 889 young adults, 106 (11.9%) were obese while 72 (8.1%) were delivered by CS; of which 14 (19.4%) were obese. Caesarean section delivery was significantly associated with obesity in young adults after adjusting for potential confounders like gestational age (at delivery), birth weight, sex, maternal age, parity and education (OR 1.99, 95% CI 1.00-3.94, p=0.049).\n\nConclusionThe association of caesarean section with early adulthood obesity should be interpreted with caution because data on certain key confounding factors such as mothers pre-pregnancy body mass index and gestational diabetes were not available. Further research from Africa, with larger sample sizes and databases with useful linking of maternal and infant data, should be conducted."

Provision of reproducibility indicators, such as materials, protocols, and raw data in a study to improve its potential for reproduction. Efforts to reproduce noteworthy studies in the biomedical sciences have resulted in an overwhelming majority of them being found to be unreplicable, causing concern for the integrity of research in other fields, including medical specialities.\n\nObjectiveHere, we analyzed the reproducibility of studies in the field of pulmonology.\n\nMethods300 pulmonology articles were randomly selected from an initial PubMed search for data extraction. Two authors scoured these articles for reproducibility indicators including materials, protocols, raw data, analysis scripts, inclusion in systematic reviews, and citations by replication studies as well as other factors of research transparency including open accessibility, funding source and competing interest disclosures, and study preregistration.\n\nMain ResultsFew publications included statements regarding materials (11%), protocols (1%), data (21%), and analysis script (0%) availability. Less than 10% indicated preregistration. More than half of the publications analyzed failed to provide a funding statement. Conversely, 66% of the publications were open access and 70% included a conflict of interest statement.\n\nConclusionOverall, our study indicates pulmonology research is currently lacking in efforts to increase replicability. Future studies should focus on providing sufficient information regarding materials, protocols, raw data, and analysis scripts, among other indicators, for the sake of clinical decisions that depend on replicable or refutable results from the primary literature."

Reproducibility and transparency has been investigated in the biomedical domain and in the social sciences, with both lacking to provide necessary information to reproduce the study findings. In this study, we investigated 14 indicators of reproducibility in anaesthesiology research.\n\nMethodsWe used the National Library of Medicine (NLM) catalogue to search for all anaesthesiology journals that are MEDLINE indexed and provided English texts. PubMed was searched with the list of journals to identify all publications from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2018. We randomly sampled 300 publications that fit the inclusion criteria for our analysis. Data extraction was then conducted in a blinded, duplicate fashion using a pilot-tested Google form.\n\nResultsThe PubMed search of these journals identified 171,441 publications, with 28,310 being within the time frame. From the 300 publications sampled, 296 full-text publications were accessible. Most of the studies did not include materials or protocol availability statements. The majority of publications did not provide a data analysis script statement (121/122, 99% [98% to 100%]) or a preregistration statement (94/122, 77% [72% to 81%]).\n\nConclusionAnaesthesiology research needs to drastically improve indicators of reproducibility and transparency. By making research publically available and improving accessibility to detailed study components, primary research can be reproduced in subsequent studies and help contribute to the development of new practice guidelines."

C.; Dalhatu, I.; Gwamna, J.; Mukhtar, A.; Aminu, Y.",Henry  Chukwunonso  Debem,2019-08-13,scientific communication and education,"Nigeria relies on data from periodic resource-intensive surveys such as antenatal HIV seroprevalence sentinel surveys (ANC-HSS) and population-based National AIDS and Reproductive Health Surveys (NARHS) for its HIV control efforts. Nigeria has not explored the use of readily available routine programmatic data (RPD) to easily inform and monitor epidemic control efforts at local settings in near real time. This study aimed to determine the utility of RPDs (Prevention of Mother-To-Child Transmission [PMTCT] and HIV Testing and Counseling [HTC]) as a proxy for monitoring HIV epidemic in Nigeria. Using World Health Organization 12 step triangulation procedures, we compared state-level seropositivity data from PMTCT and HTC programs to HIV prevalence data from NARHS and ANC-HSS reports in relevant pairs from 2010 to 2014 in Nigeria. The study population was pregnant women and general population. We abstracted relevant data from PEPFAR Nigeria data source and published national survey reports. We compared visual (scatterplots and maps) patterns and trends, and performed Pearson correlation and univariate linear regression models of the estimates for best matched/contiguous years for which data were available. Correlation between PMTCT2014 and ANC-HSS2014 was positive and significant (R=0.7,p<0.001). ANC-HSS2014 and HTC2014 were slightly correlated (R=0.4,p<0.05). Significant correlation was observed between ANC-HSS2010 and PMTCT2013 (R=0.8,p<0.001) and between ANC-HSS2010 and HTC2013 (R=0.6, p<0.001). All RPD sources and ANC-HSS indicated a decreasing trend in national HIV prevalence in Nigeria. PMTCT2014 data showed strong capability of predicting HIV prevalence in ANC-HSS2014 in regression model (B=2.09,p<0.0001). Use of routine PMTCT data in monitoring HIV prevalence among women of reproductive age could be more valid and reliable in local settings than the use of HTC data. Use of RPD to monitor national and sub-national-level HIV epidemic in between national surveys in Nigeria could maximize program resources, and promote a more responsive and efficient actions toward epidemic control."
10.1101/734137,What difference do retractions make? An estimate of the epistemic impact of retractions on recent meta-analyses.,"Fanelli, D.; Moher, D.",Daniele  Fanelli,2019-08-13,scientific communication and education,"Every year, several hundred publications are retracted due to fabrication and falsification of data or plagiarism and other breeches of research integrity and ethics. Despite considerable research on this phenomenon, the extent to which a retraction requires revising previous scientific estimates and beliefs - which we define as the epistemic impact - is unknown. We collected a representative sample of recently retracted studies that had been included in recent meta-analyses, and compared the summary effect size of these meta analyses with and without the refracted studies. On average, the retractions had occurred about six years prior to the publication of the corresponding meta-analyses.\n\nOur results suggest that retractions have varying impacts depending on their causes. In particular, removing from an analysis a study retracted because of issues with data, methods or results, led to a statistically significant reduction of the estimated effect size. Assuming that the results of these retracted studies are completely false, then the meta-analyses that had included them had overestimated the summary effect sizes by, averaging across effect size metrics, 30% (median, 13%). However, retractions due to plagiarism or other issues not related to data, methods or results had no impact on the conclusions of meta-analyses.\n\nSince retractions due to plagiarism or other non-data related issues typically constitute over 75% of total retractions, our results suggest that the epistemic impact of most retractions is likely to be null. However, our results also suggest that retractions due to issues with data, methods or results should be accompanied by a revision of relevant meta-analyses, and by extension a downwards revision of prior scientific beliefs."

Although studies on factors affecting each segment of MNH services were well documented in Ethiopia, there is a dearth of evidence on the level of continuum of care and factors associated with it. Thus, this study tries to fill this gap in the country in general and in the study area in particular.\n\nMethodsA community-based cross sectional study was conducted among 438 postnatal women who gave births in the last one year in Arba Minch Health and Demographic Surveillance Site. The sample women were selected by using computer generated random numbers from the list of women who gone at least six-weeks after birth. A pre-tested structured interviewer-administered questionnaire was used for data collection. Data was entered and coded in Epi-data and analysed using SPSS software version 23. Binary logistic regression model was fitted to identify factors associated with the outcome variable.\n\nResultsThe overall completion along the continuum of care was 42(9.7%). The factors significantly associated with continuum of care completion were early antenatal booking (before 16 weeks) [AOR: 10.751, CI (5.095, 22.688], birth preparedness and complication readiness [AOR: 2.934, CI (1.414, 6.087), pre-pregnancy contraception utilization [AOR: 3.963, CI: 1.429,\n\n10.990], employed women [AOR: 2.586, CI: ((1.245, 5.371))], and planned pregnancy [AOR: 3.494 CI :(1.068, 11.425)].\n\nConclusionCompletion along continuum of care was low in the study area. Thus, efforts in improving completion of the cares should focus on early booking during antenatal period, reducing unplanned pregnancy, and improvement on birth preparedness and complication readiness interventions."

There is paucity of information on existing pedestrian interventions and challenges that affect their implementation in Uganda. In this paper, we ascertain the state of pedestrian road safety interventions in Uganda and explore the challenges in the process of design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of existing interventions.\n\nMethodsWe conducted a qualitative study that started with a desk review of existing policy documents, police statistics, media reports, non-governmental organization reports, and published research. We supplemented the review with 14 key informant interviews and 4 focus group discussions. Participants were drawn from various agencies and stakeholders responsible for road safety. In total, we collected and synthesized data on the design, implementation, and evaluation of pedestrian safety interventions from 25 documents. Data were analyzed using qualitative thematic content analysis.\n\nResultsThe National Road Safety Council within the Ministry of Works and Transport is the lead agency tasked with coordinating all road safety efforts, while the Uganda Police is largely engaged in enforcing pedestrian safety. We identified several existing policies and regulations for pedestrian safety like the Non-Motorized Transport policy whose implementation has been inadequate. Implementation is constrained by weak institutional capacity and limited resources. Moreover, road safety stakeholders operated in silos and this hindered efforts to coordinate pedestrian safety activities. Interventions like road designs were implemented with limited reference to any supporting data and therefore did not cater for pedestrian needs.\n\nConclusionThere are interventions targeting pedestrian safety in Uganda, but effective implementation is lacking or failing due to constraints related to weak institutional capacity. This necessitates strategies to mobilize resources to strengthen the capacity of the lead agency to effectively coordinate road safety interventions."

In this paper, we confirm and extend our previous findings in several important ways. We added new questions to our anonymous and voluntary surveys to learn the extent to which students had an interest in science or engineering careers and if science fair participation increased their interest in science or engineering. And we surveyed a national rather than regional high school student group by incorporating our survey into the Scienteer online portal now used by Texas and some other states for science fair registration, parental consent, and project management. We learned that about ~60% of the more than 300 students in the national cohorts completing surveys in 2017 and 2018 said that they were interested in a career in science or engineering, and ~60% said that participating in science fair increased their interest in science or engineering. About two-thirds of the students were required to participate in science fair, and that requirement reduced the frequency of students who said that science fair increased their interest. In the worst case, ~10% of the students who said that they were not interested in a career in science or engineering and required to participate in science fair engaged in research misconduct (i.e., plagiarism and making up their results). Students positive comments about competition in science fair focused on the competition incentive, whereas their positive comments about science fair that was non-competitive focused on learning about the scientific process and learning in general. We discuss the findings in the context of National Science Teaching Association guidance about voluntary science fair participation and begin to identify features of science fair practice consistent with increased student interest in the sciences or engineering."
10.1101/734798,The state of discovery-driven neuroscience research and experimental organism usage in the United States,"Farris, S. M.",Sarah M Farris,2019-08-20,scientific communication and education,"Purely discovery-driven biological research \""...performed without thought of practical ends...\"" establishes fundamental conceptual frameworks for technological and medical breakthroughs that often occur many years later. Despite the critical importance of discovery-driven research for scientific progress, there is increasing concern that it is increasingly less favored by funding agencies than research with explicit goals of application and innovation, resulting in a decline in discovery-driven research output. This in turn appears to promote the use of genetically modified organisms (those with advanced molecular toolkits for gene manipulation and visualization) for which genetic models of human disease can be studied at molecular and cellular resolution using state of the art methodology, and to discourage use of other experimental organisms that provide necessary evolutionary context. This field of neuroscience encompasses both applied and discovery-driven research, providing an opportunity to empirically determine whether funding and publication rates for the latter have indeed declined. Additionally, the diversity of experimental organisms traditionally employed in neuroscience research provides a means to quantify changes in use of study organisms that lack genetic tools over time. In particular, the basic research field of neuroethology is characterized by its distinct approach to selection of study organisms based on their adaptive behaviors, evolutionary history, and suitability for answering the question of interest, providing a stronger basis for the assumption that findings reflect fundamental concepts of nervous system function and behavior. A 30-year analysis of National Science Foundation (NSF) funding of neuroethology research finds that the agency has funded progressively fewer researchers with smaller average award amounts, with a decline in awards for research on non-genetically modified organisms. Neuroscience funding by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) shows the same trend but also increasing support for genetically modified organisms. The same pattern is observed in the neuroscience literature but occurs prior to changes in funding, suggesting that the shift to genetically modified organisms was likely initiated by researchers but may potentially have been later reinforced by funding agency and journal publisher preferences."

J.; Ramos-Sesma, V.; Torrus-Tendero, D.; Llenas-Garcia, J.",Miriam  Navarro,2019-08-20,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundThere are few studies evaluating awareness of Chagas disease among healthcare professionals attending migrants from Latin America or working in Chagas-endemic areas. The objective of this study was to design and validate instruments for assessing knowledge about Chagas disease among healthcare students and residents as well as students and professionals of social and other health science disciplines.\n\nPrincipal findingsTwo validated scales were obtained: the 10-item Chagas Level of Knowledge Scale for healthcare professionals (ChaLKS-Medical) and the 8-item ChaLKS-Social&Health for potential aid workers from those fields. Both scales were considered adequate in terms of readability, internal consistency, construct validity and discriminant validity.\n\nThe mean number of correct answers on the ChaLKS-Medical among respondents from non-healthcare versus healthcare sectors was 1.80 (standard deviation [SD] 2.55) versus 7.00 (SD 2.32) (p<0.001). The scores on the ChaLKS-Social&Health also discriminated between the knowledge levels in these two groups (1.76 [SD 2.47] versus 6.78 [SD 1.55], p<0.001). Knowledge among medical/pharmacy students and residents on the ChaLKS-Medical was acceptable (mean 5.8 [SD 2.1] and 7.4 [SD 2.2], respectively; p<0.001). Respondents knowledge on Chagas disease was greater in those who had previously received information on the disease; this was true in both respondents from the healthcare sector (mean correct answers, ChaLKS-Medical: 7.2 [SD 2.1] versus 4.3 [2.6], p<0.001) and in potential aid workers (mean correct answers, ChaLKS-Social&Health: 5.1 [SD 2.5] versus 1.1 [SD 1.9], p=0.001).\n\nConclusionsThe metric properties of both scales are adequate for their use in supporting aid operations in Chagas-endemic countries or in providing health and social care to migrant populations in non-endemic countries. The results of these scales also provide orientation regarding the knowledge gaps to be filled in future health professionals training programs.\n\nAuthor summaryChagas disease is endemic to much of Latin America, but it is still largely unrecognized in Europe, in part because of the lack of professional training in tropical medicine and global health among healthcare professionals. Few studies have evaluated awareness of Chagas disease among healthcare professionals and medical students, and to our knowledge none have done so in aid workers or volunteers working with Latin American populations. The aim of our study was to design and validate instruments for assessing knowledge about Chagas disease among healthcare students and professionals as well as potential aid workers. Two validated scales were obtained: the Chagas Level of Knowledge Scale for healthcare professionals (ChaLKS-Medical) and the ChaLKS-Social&Health for potential aid workers in social and other health fields. The two scales could be especially useful to reinforce training on Chagas disease among medical students and health and social aid workers working in Chagas-endemic regions or with migrants from those countries, regardless of whether their mission is related to Chagas or not. Moreover, this could reinforce the cross-cutting nature of programs in areas endemic to Chagas and other neglected tropical diseases."

This paper describes a wide range of health behaviors among male and female university students in Cambodia.\n\nMethodsA cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2015 among students randomly selected from the Royal University of Phnom Penh and University of Battambang. Health-related behaviors in different domains were collected using a structured questionnaire. Chi-square test, Fishers exact test, or independent Students t-test was used as appropriate to describe and compare the variables among male and female students.\n\nResultsThis study included 1359 students, of whom 50.8% were male, and the mean age was 21.3 years (SD= 2.3). Of the total, 79.5% reported not having any vigorous-intensity activities, 25.9% not having moderate-intensity activities, and 33.5% not having walked continuously for 10 minutes during the past seven days. The prevalence of substance use was low with 38.3% currently drinking alcohol, 1.1% smoking tobacco, and 0.4% using an illicit drug during the past 12 months. About one in ten (10.6%) reported having sexual intercourse, with a mean number of partners of 2.1 (SD= 2.4) during the past 12 months, and 42.4% not using a condom in the last intercourse. Only 7.1% reported having been diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection in the past 12 months; of whom, 60% sought for treatment. About one-third (33.6%) reported eating fast food once or twice, and 5.3% having it three times or more over the last week. More than half (55.6%) had one to two servings of fruits and vegetables daily, and 9.9% did not eat any fruits and vegetables over the last week.\n\nConclusionsWe found that the prevalence of sexual risk behaviors and substance use was plausibly low among university students in this study. However, the rates of inactive lifestyle and unhealthy food consumption were concerning. Public policy and universities should promote healthy behaviors among the students. The interventions may take advantage of and expend upon the good health behaviors and consider gender differences."

I.; Park, J.-M.",Ji-Man  Park,2019-08-22,scientific communication and education,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the trueness of 5 intraoral scanners (IOSs) for digital impression of simulated implant scan bodies in a complete-arch model. A 3D printed full-arch mandible model made of Co-Cr with a total of 6 bilaterally positioned cylinders in the canine, second premolar, and second molar area served as the study model. Digital scans of the model were made with a reference scanner (steroSCAN neo) and 5 IOSs (CEREC Omnicam, CS3600, i500, iTero Element, and TRIOS 3) (n=10). For each IOSs dataset, the XYZ coordinates of the cylinders were obtained from the reference point and the deviations from the reference scanner were calculated using a 3D reverse engineering program (Rapidform). The trueness values were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney post hoc test. Direction and amount of deviation differed among cylinder position and among IOSs. Regardless of the IOS type, the cylinders positioned on the left second molar, nearest to the scanning start point, showed the smallest deviation. The deviation generally increased further away from scanning start point towards the right second molar. TRIOS 3 and i500 outperformed the other IOSs for complete-arch digital impression. The accuracy of the CEREC Omnicam, CS3600, and iTero Element were similar on the left side, but they showed more deviations on the right side of the arch when compared to the other IOSs. The accuracy of IOS is still an area that needs to be improved."

A.; Szejnfeld, J.",Lucas  Scatigno  Saad,2019-08-22,scientific communication and education,"PurposeTo compare diffusion images and coefficients obtained with 4 b-value versus 12 b-value apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping for characterization of prostate lesions and how these coefficients relate and compare to the PI-RADS classification and Gleason grading system.\n\nMethodsPatients with indications for prostate cancer testing (n=158) underwent multiparametric 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Two diffusion sequences were acquired, one with 4 b values and one with 12 b values. ADC maps were calculated for each (ADC4 and ADC12) and the respective coefficients were tested for correlation with PI-RADS classification and Gleason score.\n\nResultsThe ADC12 sequence produced images of superior quality and sharpness than ADC4. Normal-area means (ADC4, 1793.3x10-6mm2/s; ADC12, 1100x10-6mm2/s) were significantly lower than those of lesion areas (ADC4, 1105.9x10-6mm2/s; ADC12, 689.4x10-6mm2/s) (p<0.001). Both techniques behaved similarly and correlated well with PI-RADS classification, distinguishing scores 3, 4, and 5 and with means tending to decline with increasing Gleason grade. ADC12 mapping yielded higher specificity than ADC4 (82.6% vs. 72.3%).\n\nConclusionsDiffusion with 12 values is a viable technique for examination of the prostate. It produced higher-quality images than current techniques and correlates well with PI-RADS classification and Gleason score."
10.1101/741694,Gender bias in research teams and the underrepresentation of women in science,"Dakin, R.; Ryder, T. B.",Roslyn  Dakin,2019-08-24,scientific communication and education,"Why are females still underrepresented in science? The social factors that affect career choices and trajectories are thought to be important but are poorly understood. We analyzed author gender in a sample of >61,000 scientific articles in the biological sciences to evaluate the factors that shape the formation of research teams. We find that authorship teams are more gender-assorted than expected by chance, with excess homotypic assortment accounting for up to 7% of published articles. One possible mechanism that could explain gender assortment and broader patterns of female representation is that women may focus on different research topics than men (i.e., the \""topic preference\"" hypothesis). An alternative hypothesis is that researchers may consciously or unconsciously prefer to work within same-gender teams (the \""gender homophily\"" hypothesis). Using network analysis, we find no evidence to support the topic preference hypothesis, because the topics of female-authored articles are no more similar to each other than expected within the broader research landscape. Instead, consistent with a model of moderate gender homophily, we find that the prevalence of matched-gender teams increases as a discipline moves towards gender parity. This can occur because latent preferences are more easily fulfilled in a gender-diverse environment. Finally, we show that female authors pay a substantial citation cost to work in gender-matched teams. Notably, the prevalence of homotypic assortment is predicted to increase in the future if more disciplines shift towards gender parity. These data indicate that social preferences can have important downstream consequences for the retention of women and other underrepresented groups in science."

10.1101/748889,From intent to implementation: Factors affecting public involvement in life science research,"Burns, J. A.; Korzec, K.; Dorris, E. R.",Emma R Dorris,2019-08-28,scientific communication and education,"Public involvement is key to closing the gap between research production and research use, and the only way to achieving ultimate transparency in science. The majority of life science research is not public-facing, but is funded by the public and impacts the community. We undertook a survey of researchers within the life sciences to better understand their views and perceived challenges to involving the public in their research. We had a valid response cohort of n=110 researchers, of whom 90% were primarily laboratory based. Using a mixed methods approach, we demonstrate that a top-down approach is key to motivate progression of life scientists from feeling positive towards public involvement to actually engaging in it. Researchers who viewed public involvement as beneficial to their research were more likely to have direct experience of doing it. We demonstrate that the systemic flaws in the way life sciences research enterprise is organised, including the promotion system, hypercompetition, and time pressures are major barriers to involving the public in the scientific process. Scientists are also apprehensive of being involuntarily involved in the current politicized climate, misinformation and publicity hype surrounding science nowadays makes them hesitant to share their early and in-progress research. The time required to deliberate study design and relevance, plan and build relationships for sustained involvement, provide and undertake training, and improve communication in the current research environment is often considered nonpragmatic, particularly for early career researchers. In conclusion, a top-down approach involving institutional incentives and infrastructure appears most effective at transitioning researchers from feeling positive towards public involvement to actually implementing it."

The reported retention at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months were 90.7%, 78.1%, 68.8% and 64.4%, respectively. We report findings of a follow up evaluation for the 2012-2015 cohorts to assess the implementation & impact of recommendations from this prior evaluation.\n\nMethodsA nationwide retrospective study was conducted in 2016. Multi-stage proportional sampling was used to select health facilities and study participants records. The data extracted from patient manual records included demographic, baseline clinical characteristics and patient outcomes (active on treatment, died, transferred out, stopped ART and lost to follow-up (LFTU)) at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months. The data were analysed using Stata/IC 14.2. Retention was estimated using survival analysis. The predictors associated with attrition were determined using a multivariate Cox regression model.\n\nResultsA total of 3,810 participants were recruited in the study. The median age in years was 35 (IQR: 28-42). Overall, retention increased to 92.4%, 86.5%, 79.2% and 74.4% at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months respectively. LFTU accounted for 98% of attrition. Being an adolescent or a young adult (aHR 1.41; 95%CI:1.14-1.74), receiving care at primary health care facility (aHR 1.23; 95%CI:1.01-1.49), having initiated ART between 2014-2015 (aHR 1.45; 95%CI:1.24-1.69), having WHO Stage 4 (aHR 2.06; 95%CI:1.51-2.81) and impaired functional status (aHR 1.24; 95%CI:1.04-1.49) predicted attrition.\n\nConclusionThe overall retention was higher in comparison to the previous 2007--2010 evaluation. Further studies to understand why attrition was found to be higher at primary health care facilities are warranted. Implementation of strategies for managing patients with advanced HIV disease, differentiated care for adolescents and young adults and tracking of LFTU should be prioritised to further improve retention."

However, the deleterious effects of font tuning suggest that low inter-letter regularity (due to the enhancement of specific letter features to make them more differentiable) may impair word recognition performance. The aim of the present investigation was 1) to validate our hypothesis that reducing inter-letter regularity impairs reading performance, as suggested by font tuning, and 2) to test whether some forms of non-regularities could impair visual word recognition more. To do so, we designed four new fonts. For each font we induced one type of increased perceptual difference: for the first font, the letters have longer extender length; for the second font, the letters have different slants; and for the third font, the letters have different font cases. We also designed a fourth font where letters differ on all three aspects (worst regularity across letters). Word recognition performance was measured for each of the four fonts in comparison to a traditional sans serif font (best regularity across letters) through a lexical decision task. Results showed a significant decrease in word recognition performance only for the fonts with mixed-case letters, suggesting that fonts with low regularity, such as mixed-case letters, should be avoided in the definition of new \""optimal\"" fonts. Letter recognition performance measured for the five different fonts through a trigram recognition task showed that this effect is not consistently due to poor letter identification."

Often these are converted to simple, and frequently contested, rankings based on quantitative analysis of those outputs. These rankings can have substantial implications for student and staff recruitment, research income and perceived prestige of a university. Both internal and external analyses usually rely on a single data source to define the set of outputs assigned to a specific university. Although some differences between such databases are documented, few studies have explored them at the institutional scale and examined the implications of these differences for the metrics and rankings that are derived from them. We address this gap by performing detailed bibliographic comparisons between three key databases: Web of Science (WoS), Scopus and, the recently relaunched Microsoft Academic (MSA). We analyse the differences between outputs with DOIs identified from each source for a sample of 155 universities and supplement this with a detailed manual analysis of the differences for fifteen universities. We find significant differences between the sources at the university level. Sources differ in the publication year of specific objects, the completeness of metadata, as well as in their coverage of disciplines, outlets, and publication type. We construct two simple rankings based on citation counts and open access status of the outputs for these universities and show dramatic changes in position based on the choice of bibliographic data sources. Those universities that experience the largest changes are frequently those from non-English speaking countries and those that are outside the top positions in international university rankings. Overall MSA has greater coverage than Scopus or WoS, but has less complete affiliation metadata. We suggest that robust evaluation measures need to consider the effect of choice of data sources and recommend an approach where data from multiple sources is integrated to provide a more robust dataset."

Tapinanthus bangwensis (TBG) is a semi-parasitic plant with multipurpose uses in Nigerian ethno-medicine among which is its anti-infective properties as well as the anti-tumor and restoration of damaged tissues. Despite the wide and varied uses of TBG, the anti-angiogenic investigation of the plant on different host trees is lacking while the documentation and scientific validation of indigenous knowledge on plants use is urgent. The present work focuses on the anti-angiogenic activities of the crude extracts and partitioned fractions of the leaves of Tapinanthus bangwensis (TBG) using the Chick chorio allantoic membrane (CAM) model. The plant was collected from three different host trees namely Albizia lebbeck (AL), Stereospermum kunthianum (SK) and Tabebuia rosea (TR). The methanolic crude extracts and solvent-partitioned fractions of TBG-SK samples were assessed for their anti-angiogenic activities using the chick chorio allantoic membrane (CAM) in ovo and in vitro assay methods respectively. Purification and isolation of major compound(s) in the chloroform fraction of TBG extract obtained from Stereospermum kunthianum host tree (TBG-SK) was carried out using chromatographic and spectroscopic methods (NMR, MS).\n\nThe crude methanolic extract of TBG-SK was most potent (100% activity) in the CAM in ovo assay while the chloroform fraction produced a significantly (p<0.05) highest average reduction in blood vessels with resultant formation of large avascular zones on CAM following an in vitro CAM assay. The anti-angiogenic chloroform fraction revealed the presence of a UV-active triterpenoid moiety. Findings from this work, has provided some justification for the folkloric use of TBG and thus forms a potential basis for drug discovery for wide-ranging disease states."

Unfortunately, in recent years traditional journalism has experienced a collapse, and science journalism has been a major casualty. One potential remedy is to encourage scientists to write for news media about science. On these general news platforms, scientists stories would have to compete for attention with other news stories on hard (e.g. politics) and entertaining (e.g. celebrity news) topics written by professional writers. Do they stand a chance?\n\nThis study aimed to quantitatively characterize audience interactions as an indicator of interest in science news stories authored by early career scientists (henceforth  scientists) trained to function as science reporters, as compared to news items written by reporters and published in the same news outlets.\n\nTo measure users behavior, we collected data on the number of clicks, likes, comments and average time spent on page. The sample was composed of 150 science items written by 50 scientists trained to contribute popular science stories in the Davidson Institute of Science Education reporters program and published on two major Israeli news websites - Mako and Ynet between July 2015 to January 2018. Each science item was paired with another item written by the websites organic reporter, and published on the same channel as the science story (e.g., tourism, health) and the same close time. Overall significant differences were not found in the publics engagement with the different items. Although, on one website there was a significant difference on two out of four engagement types, the second website did not have any difference, e.g., people did not click, like or comment more on items written by organic reporters than on the stories written by scientists. This creates an optimistic starting point for filling the science news void by scientists as science reporters."

This study proposed to map the determinants of the use of dental care services within the health care network to address dental emergencies of the Brazilian Unified Health System (UHS) and to verify the main gaps in the research in this area. This is a scoping review that took place in 2018 using Andersens behavioral model as a reference. A total of 16 studies, out of 3786 original articles identified, were included and reviewed. Two reviewers independently conducted the selection process and the decision was consensually taken. The mapping of the determinants revealed a greater number of enabling factors and a larger gap in results. Greater use of the emergency service was registered by people in pain, women, adults, from an urban area, with a lower income, and less education. In future studies, primary surveys are recommended, which include all ages, analyzing different groups of needs and users that take into account the countrys northern region and the different subjects pointed out in this review."
10.1101/751867,A data-based guide to the North American ecology faculty job market,"Fox, J.",Jeremy  Fox,2019-09-07,scientific communication and education,"Every year for three years (2016 to 2018), I tried to identify every single person hired as a tenure track prof in ecology or an allied field (e.g., fish & wildlife) in N. America. I identified a total of 566 hires. I used public sources to compile various data on the new hires and the institutions that hired them (e.g., number of publications, teaching experience, hiring institution Carnegie class). I also compiled data provided by anonymous ecology faculty job seekers on ecoevojobs.net (e.g., number of positions applied for, number of publications, numbers of interviews and offers). And I polled readers of the Dynamic Ecology blog to get information about applicant and search committee behavior (e.g., regarding customization of applications to the hiring institution). These data address some widespread anxieties and misunderstandings about the ecology faculty job market, and also speak to gender diversity and equity in recent ecology faculty hiring. They complement, and in some cases improve on, other sources of information, such as anecdotal personal experiences."
10.1101/763045,Review of layperson screening tools and model for a holistic mental health screener in lower and middle income countries,"Aderibigbe, O. O.; Perlman, C. M.",Oluwakemi  Olanike  Aderibigbe,2019-09-09,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundThe needs of people diagnosed with Mental Neurological and Substance-Use (MNS) conditions are complex including interactions physical, social, medical and environmental factors. Treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach including health and social services at different levels of care. However, due to inadequate assessment, services and scarcity of human resource for mental health, treatment of persons diagnosed with MNS conditions in many LMICs is mainly facility-based pharmacotherapy with minimal non-pharmacology treatments and social support services. In low resource settings, gaps in human resource capacity may be met using layperson health workers. A layperson health working is one without formal mental health training and may be equivalent to community health worker (CHW) or less cadre in primary health care system.\n\nObjectivesThis study reviewed layperson mental health screening tools for use in supporting mental health in developing countries, including the content and psychometric properties of the tools. Based on this review this study proposes recommendations for the design and effective use of layperson mental health screening tools based on the Five Pillars of global mental health.\n\nMethodsA systematic review was used to identify and examine the use of mental health screening tools among laypersons supporting community-based mental health programs. PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL and PsychInfo databases were reviewed using a comprehensive list of keywords and MESH terms that included mental health, screening tools, lay-person, lower and middle income countries. Articles were included if they describe mental health screening tools used by laypersons for screening, delivery or monitoring of MNS conditions in community-based program in LMICs. Diagnostic tools were not included in this study. Trained research interviewers or research assistants were not considered as lay health workers for this study.\n\nResultsThere were eleven studies retained after 633 were screened. Twelve tools were identified covering specific disorders (E.g. alcohol and substance use, subcortical dementia associated with HIV/AIDS, PTSD) or common mental disorders (mainly depression and anxiety). These tools have been tested in LMICs including South Africa, Zimbabwe, Haiti, Malaysia, Pakistan, India, Ethiopia and Brazil. The included studies show that simple screening tools can enhance the value of laypersons and better support their roles in providing community-based mental health support. However, most of the layperson MH screening tools used in LMICs do not provide comprehensive information that can inform integrated comprehensive treatment planning and understanding of the broader mental health needs of the community.\n\nConclusionDeveloping a layperson screening tools is vital for integrated community-based mental health intervention. This study proposed a holistic framework which considers the relationship between individuals physical, mental and spiritual aspect of mental health, interpersonal as well as broader contextual determinants (community, policy and different level of the health system) that can be consulted for developing or selecting a layperson mental health screening instrument. More research are needed to evaluate the practical application of this framework."

U.; Uddin, Z.; Hossain, A.",Ahmed  Hossain,2019-09-09,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundThe factors of road traffic delays (RTDs) have significant consequences for both commuters health and the countrys economy as a whole. Addressing the musculoskeletal health complaints (MHCs) among full-time employees has not been fully explored. The current study investigates the association between RTDs-related factors and MHCs among bank employees.\n\nMethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional study among full-time employees from 32 banks in Dhaka city. Descriptive statistics summarized the gaps in the socio-demographic and RTDs-related factors on the one-month prevalence of MHCs. Random intercept logistic regression models were used to identify the associate factors of the MHCs.\n\nResultsOut of 628 full-time bank employees, the one-month prevalence of MHCs was 57.7%. The MHCs are more prevalent among adults of age group 40-60 years (68%) than the age group 20-40 years (54%). The one-month prevalence of lower back pain (LBP) was highest (36.6%), followed by neck pain (22.9%) and upper back pain (21.2%). Multilevel logistic regression analysis of employees showed that the odds of MHCs were lower among male employees (AOR=0.42, 95% CI= 0.27, 0.64), car commuters (AOR = 0.38, 95% CI=0.19-0.76, reference: bus commuters) and rickshaw commuters (AOR=. = 0.39, 95% CI=0.22-0.69, reference: bus commuters). The MHCs were significantly higher among employees with following factors: obesity (AOR= 1.50, 95% CI= 1.02-2.21), prolonged commute time to the office (AOR = 7.48, 95% CI =3.64-15.38) and working extended-time in a day (AOR= 1.50, 95% CI= 1.02-2.21).\n\nConclusionsThe study indicates a high burden of musculoskeletal health complaints among the employees in Dhaka city, and the most prevalent complaint was low back pain. Our study suggests that factors related to road traffic delays might act synergistically on developing musculoskeletal problems in full-time employees."
10.1101/766071,Bayesian hierarchical models for disease mapping applied to contagious pathologies,"Coly, S.; Garrido, M.; Abrial, D.; Yao, A.-F.",Myriam  Garrido,2019-09-11,scientific communication and education,"Disease mapping aims to determine the underlying disease risk from scattered epidemiological data and to represent it on a smoothed colored map. This methodology is based on Bayesian inference and is classically dedicated to non-infectious diseases whose incidence is low and whose cases distribution is spatially (and eventually temporally) structured. Over the last decades, disease mapping has received many major improvements to extend its scope of application: integrating the temporal dimension, dealing with missing data, taking into account various a prioris (environmental and population covariates, assumptions concerning the repartition and the evolution of the risk), dealing with overdispersion, etc. We aim to adapt this approach to rare infectious diseases. In the context of a contagious disease, the outcome of a primary case can in addition generate secondary occurrences of the pathology in a close spatial and temporal neighborhood; this can result in local overdispersion and in higher spatial and temporal dependencies due to direct and/or indirect transmission. We have proposed and tested 60 Bayesian hierarchical models on 400 simulated datasets and bovine tuberculosis real data. This analysis shows the relevance of the CAR (Conditional AutoRegressive) processes to deal with the structure of the risk. We can also conclude that the negative binomial models outperform the Poisson models with a Gaussian noise to handle overdispersion. In addition our study provided relevant maps which are congruent with the real risk (simulated data) and with the knowledge concerning bovine tuberculosis (real data).\n\nAuthor summaryDisease mapping is dedicated to non-infectious diseases whose incidence is low and whose distribution is spatially (and eventually temporally) structured. In this paper, we aim to adapt this approach to rare infectious pathologies. In the context of a contagious disease, the outcome of a primary case can in addition generate secondary occurrences of the pathology in a close spatial and temporal neighborhood, resulting in local overdispersion and in high spatial and temporal dependencies. We thus explored different adapted spatial, temporal and spatiotemporal links and highlight the most adapted to likely risk structures for infectious diseases. We also conclude that the negative binomial models outperform the Poisson models with a Gaussian noise to handle overdispersion. Our study also provided relevant maps which are congruent with the real risk (in case of simulated data) and with the knowledge concerning bovine tuberculosis (when applying to real data). Thus disease mapping appears as a promising way to investigate rare infectious diseases."

S.; Vassar, M.",Sheby L Rauh,2019-09-16,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundThe objective of this study was to evaluate the nature and extent of reproducible and transparent research practices in neurology research.\n\nMethodsThe NLM catalog was used to identify MEDLINE-indexed neurology journals. A PubMed search of these journals was conducted to retrieve publications over a 5-year period from 2014 to 2018. A random sample of publications was extracted. Two authors conducted data extraction in a blinded, duplicate fashion using a pilot-tested Google form. This form prompted data extractors to determine whether publications provided access to items such as study materials, raw data, analysis scripts, and protocols. In addition, we determined if the publication was included in a replication study or systematic review, was preregistered, had a conflict of interest declaration, specified funding sources, and was open access.\n\nResultsOur search identified 223,932 publications meeting the inclusion criteria, from which 300 were randomly sampled. Only 290 articles were accessible, yielding 202 publications with empirical data for analysis. Our results indicate that 8.99% provided access to materials, 9.41% provided access to raw data, 0.50% provided access to the analysis scripts, 0.99% linked the protocol, and 3.47% were preregistered. A third of sampled publications lacked funding or conflict of interest statements. No publications from our sample were included in replication studies, but a fifth were cited in a systematic review or meta-analysis.\n\nConclusionsCurrent research in the field of neurology does not consistently provide information needed for reproducibility. The implications of poor research reporting can both affect patient care and increase research waste. Collaborative intervention by authors, peer reviewers, journals, and funding sources is needed to mitigate this problem."
10.1101/757724,Low-intensity environmental education can enhance perceptions of culturally taboo wildlife,"Williams, S. T.; Williams, K. S.; Constant, N. L.; Swanepoel, L. H.; Taylor, P. J.; Belmain, S. R.; Evans, S. W.",Samual T Williams,2019-09-16,scientific communication and education,"1.Traditional cultural beliefs influence perceptions of animals, and in some cases can result in persecution of wildlife. Stigmas against species associated with witchcraft, for example, can act as a barrier to the uptake of more cost effective, sustainable, and environmentally sound practices such as reducing crop damage by controlling rodent agricultural pests by relying on indigenous predators rather than pesticides. One way of enhancing perceptions of wildlife to increase participation in such ecologically-based rodent management (EBRM) schemes, is the development of environmental education initiatives. Low intensity programmes are cost-effective and can produce positive attitudinal shifts, but their impact has not been assessed for species strongly associated with witchcraft. We set out to test whether a single presentation on the natural history of owls (order Strigiformes) could improve perceptions of these species, and increase willingness to participate in an EBRM scheme that involved the installation of owl boxes to increase owl populations and reduce rodent populations and crop damage in agricultural fields. We used a questionnaire survey to assess perceptions of owls at four schools in two villages in South Africa. Our initial survey sampled perceptions of respondents before listening to the presentation. A follow-up survey conducted three months later sampled the perceptions of respondents that had listened to the presentation as well as perceptions of a control group that did not listen to the presentation. We found that associations between owls and witchcraft was a common theme driving negative perceptions of owls. Respondents that watched the presentation had more positive perceptions of owls than respondents that had not watched the presentation, and they were more likely to be willing to put up owl boxes near their home. Despite this shift, negative perceptions of owls still dominated responses due to cultural associations with the occult. These findings indicate that even low-intensity programmes can be effective at enhancing perceptions of wildlife associated with witchcraft. We suggest that environmental education programmes featuring culturally taboo species should adopt a culturally sensitive and locally tailored approach, focus on the benefits these species provide, and may be more effective when delivered with greater intensity."

E.; Martinez, A.; Khan, A. M.; Olimpo, J. T.",Christina E. D'Arcy,2019-09-16,scientific communication and education,"Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) engage emerging scholars in the authentic process of scientific discovery, and foster their development of content knowledge, motivation, and persistence in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Importantly, authentic research courses simultaneously offer investigators unique access to an extended population of students who receive education and mentoring in conducting scientifically relevant investigations and who are thus able to contribute effort toward big-data projects. While this paradigm benefits fields in neuroscience, such as atlas-based brain mapping of nerve cells at the tissue level, there are few documented cases of such laboratory courses offered in the domain.\n\nHere, we describe a curriculum designed to address this deficit, evaluate the scientific merit of novel student-produced brainatlasmapsofimmunohistochemically-identifiednervecellpopulations for the rat brain, and assess shifts in science identity, attitudes, and science communication skills of students engaged in the introductory-level Brain Mapping and Connectomics (BM&C) CURE. BM&C students reported gains in research and science process skills following participation in the course. Furthermore, BM&C students experienced a greater sense of science identity, including a greater likelihood to discuss course activities with non-class members compared to their non-CURE counterparts. Importantly, evaluation of student-generated brain atlas maps indicated that the course enabled students to produce scientifically valid products and make new discoveries to advance the field of neuroanatomy. Together, these findings support the efficacy of the BM&C course in addressing the relatively esoteric demands of chemoarchitectural brain mapping."

With the changes in the socioeconomic aspect of Nepalese society, many elderly are relocating from their homes to old age homes. This study was conducted to assess the status of abuse among the elderly before they enter to old aged homes.

A cross sectional study was conducted to assess the status of abuse among elderly before they enter to the old age homes. Consecutive sampling technique was used and semi structured interview schedule was used to collect the data from 109 elderly residing in 6 old aged homes in Pokhara. Collected data was analyzed descriptive and inferential (chi square) statistics using SPSS version 16.

The findings from the study showed that that 97.2% of the elderly experienced some forms of abuse before they were brought to the old Age home. Majority of them reported that they experienced neglect (83.5%) followed by verbal abuse (34.9) while least of them (5.5%) reported that they suffered physical abuse(2.8%) and financial abuse(2.8%). However, no significant association could be seen between abuse of elderly with age, education, marital status, place of residence, having children and adequacy of income. It is recommended that the nation develop and implement necessary plans to strengthen the social security of the people at their old age."

Despite efforts toward improvement, certain elements needed to reproduce a study are often lacking from publications. The current state of reproducibility within the sports medicine research community remains unknown.\n\nPurposeOur study sought to evaluate the presence of eight indicators of reproducibility and transparency to determine the current state of research reporting in sports medicine research.\n\nStudy DesignCross-sectional review\n\nMethodsUsing the National Library of Medicine catalog, we identified 41 MEDLINE-indexed, English language sports medicine journals. From the 41 journals, we randomly sampled 300 publications that were recorded on PubMed as being published between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2018. Two investigators extracted data in duplicate and blinded fashion.\n\nResultsOf the 300 publications sampled, 280 were accessible and were screened for empirical data.

Both structural bias (e.g., lack of proportionate representation) and interpersonal bias (e.g., sexism, discrimination) generate costs to underrepresented minorities. How can we estimate these costs and what interventions are most effective for reducing them? We used agent-based simulations, removing gender differences in interpersonal bias to isolate and quantify the impact and costs of structural bias (unequal gender ratios) on individuals and institutions. We compared the long-term impact of bias-confrontation strategies. Unequal gender ratios led to higher costs for female agents and institutions and increased sexism among male agents. Confronting interpersonal bias by targets and allies attenuated the impact of structural bias. However, bias persisted even after a structural intervention to suddenly make previously unequal institutions equal (50% women) unless the probability of interpersonal bias-confrontation was further increased among targets and allies. This computational approach allows for comparison of various policies to attenuate structural equality, and informs the design of new experiments to estimate parameters for more accurate predictions."

Among other sources of  artificial confounding, including cyclical oscillations of the  cage microbiome, we quantified the heterogeneity of modern husbandry practices/perceptions. The objective was to identify actionable themes to re-launch emerging protocols and intuitive statistical strategies to increase study power. Amenable for interventions,  cost-vs-science discordance was a major aspect explaining heterogeneity and the reluctance to change. Combined, four sources of information (scoping-reviews, professional-surveys, expert-opinion, and  implementability-score-statistics) indicate that a six-actionable-theme framework could minimize  artificial heterogeneity. With a  Housing Density Cost Simulator in Excel and fully annotated statistical examples, this framework could reignite the use of  study power to monitor the success/reproducibility of mouse-microbiome studies."

However, this sector is under threat with periodic outbreaks of Avian Influenza (AI) subtypes H5 and H9 since 2009. This has been both a both public health threat and an economic issue. Since last three years, outbreaks of AI subtype H9 has caused huge economic losses in major poultry producing areas of Nepal. However, the risk factors associated with these outbreaks have not been assessed. A retrospective case-control study was conducted from April 2018 to May 2019 in Kathmandu Valley to understand the risk factors associated with AI subtype H9 outbreaks. Out of 100 farms selected, 50 were \""case\"" farms, confirmed positive to H9 at Central Veterinary Laboratory, Kathmandu, and other 50 farms were \""control\"" farms, matched for farm size and locality within a radius of three km from the case farm. Each farm was visited to collect information using semi-structured questionnaire. Nineteen potential risk factors were included in the questionnaire under the broad categories: birds and farm characteristics, management aspects and biosecurity status of the farms. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis were conducted to calculate corresponding odds ratios. Identified risk factors associated with AI subtype H9 outbreaks in Kathmandu valley were: \""Birds of age 31-40 days\"" (OR= 11.31, 95% CI: 1.31-98.02, p=0.028), \""Older farms operating for >5 years\"" (OR= 10.9, 95% CI: 1.76-66.93, p=0.01), \""Commercial layers farms\"" (OR=36.0, 95% CI: 0.97-1332.40, p=0.052), \""Used stream water to water birds (OR= 5.7, 95% CI: 1.10-30.13, p=0.039)\"", \""Farms without practice of fumigation after each batch of poultry (OR= 4, 95% CI: 1.44-13.13, p=0.009)., \""Farm with previous history of AI (OR= 13.8, 95% CI: 1.34-143.63, p = 0.028), \""Did not applied farm boots (OR= 2.58, 95% CI: 0.98-6.80, p= 0.055), \""Visitors allowed to enter the farms (OR= 2.5, 95% CI: 1.011-6.17, p = 0.047) and \""No foot bath at entry of farms (OR= 3.3, 95% CI: 1.29-8.38, p = 0.013). This study depicts that outbreaks of AI subtype H9 in Kathmandu valley was related to poor management practices and biosecurity in the poultry farms. We suggest improving management practices and increase biosecurity in the farms to reduce incidences of AI subtype H9 outbreaks in Kathmandu valley."

However, the mouse pad has been neglected with regard to both research and regular cleaning and disinfection in hospitals. In our study, we monitored and evaluated the bacteriology degrees of 74 computers keyboards, mouses and mouse pads from six departments. The results showed that before cleaning-disinfection, the contamination rate of the mouse pad ranked second following the keyboards. Enterococcus Faecium was cultured from the mouse pads. The computer-related equipment in the wards and outpatient rooms were much more contaminated than that in the operating rooms. Acinetobacter spp. was only isolated from the doctors computers. After cleaning-disinfection, 4 strains of MRSA were isolated from the keyboards and the mouses, one and 3 were cultured at day 3 and day 5 after cleaning-disinfection, respectively. One strain of Pseudomonas Aeruginosa was isolated from the mouses at day 3 after cleaning-disinfection. These demonstrated that the bacterial contamination of the mouse pads must be as emphasized as that of the keyboards and mouses. Furthermore, It is better to clean and disinfect the computer-related equipment(keyboards, mouses, mouse pads) at least once a day."

Both English and Chinese literatures were retrieved and analyzed. Randomized controlled trials or nonrandomized controlled trials on the use of CNs during thyroidectomy were enrolled in this study. The primary outcomes included the number of lymph nodes harvesed, rate of lymph nodes involvement, and the rates of accidental parathyroidectomy, hypoparathyroidism, and hypocalcemia. Weighted mean differences (WMDs), odds ratios (ORs) and risk differences (RDs) were calculated for the dichotomous outcome variables. Between-study heterogeneity was tested using the Q tests and the I2 statistics. All analyses were performed using Review Manager (version 5.3.5).\n\nResults25 studies comprising 3266 patients were included in this analysis. The total number of lymph nodes harvested in the groups of carbon nanoparticles was significant higher than that in the control groups (WMD, 2.36; 95% CI, 1.40 to 3.32; P <0.01). Administrating carbon nanoparticles was associated with a lower incidence of accidental parathyroid gland removal (OR = 0.30, 95% CI = 0.23 to 0.40, P <0.01) and lower rates of both postoperative transient hypoparathyroidism (OR =0.46, 95% CI = 0.33 to 0.64, P <0.01) and transient hypocalcemia (OR =0.55, 95% CI = 0.09 to 3.43, P =0.52). There was no significant difference of identified lymph node metastatic rates between the patients with and without use of carbon nanoparticles. Subgroup analyses indicated that the application of CNs in thyroid cancer reoperation also decreased the rate of transient hypoparathyroidism (OR =0.20, 95% CI = 0.36 to 0.04, P =0.01) and the possibility of accidental parathyroid glands removal (OR = 0.19, 95% CI = 0.05 to 0.73, P<0.05).\n\nConclusionsThe application of CNs for thyroidectomy results in higher number of lymph node harvested and better parathyroid gland protection during initial surgery and reoperation for thyroid cancer."

T.; Lopatto, D.; Goecks, J.; Elgin, S. C. R.",Sarah C. R. Elgin,2019-10-02,scientific communication and education,"Scientists are sequencing new genomes at an increasing rate with the goal of associating genome contents with phenotypic traits. After a new genome is sequenced and assembled, structural gene annotation is often the first step in analysis. Despite advances in computational gene prediction algorithms, most eukaryotic genomes still benefit from manual gene annotation. Undergraduates can become skilled annotators, and in the process learn both about genes/genomes and about how to utilize large datasets. Data visualizations provided by a genome browser are essential for manual gene annotation, enabling annotators to quickly evaluate multiple lines of evidence (e.g., sequence similarity, RNA-Seq, gene predictions, repeats). However, creating genome browsers requires extensive computational skills; lack of the expertise required remains a major barrier for many biomedical researchers and educators.\n\nTo address these challenges, the Genomics Education Partnership (GEP; https://gep.wustl.edu/) has partnered with the Galaxy Project (https://galaxyproject.org) to develop G-OnRamp (http://g-onramp.org), a web-based platform for creating UCSC Assembly Hubs and JBrowse genome browsers. G-OnRamp can also convert a JBrowse instance into an Apollo instance for collaborative genome annotations in research and educational settings. G-OnRamp enables researchers to easily visualize their experimental results, educators to create Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) centered on genome annotation, and students to participate in genomics research.\n\nDevelopment of G-OnRamp was guided by extensive user feedback from in-person workshops. Sixty-five researchers and educators from over 40 institutions participated in these workshops, which produced over 20 genome browsers now available for research and education. For example, genome browsers for four parasitoid wasp species were used in a CURE engaging 142 students taught by 13 faculty members -- producing a total of 192 gene models. G-OnRamp can be deployed on a personal computer or on cloud computing platforms, and the genome browsers produced can be transferred to the CyVerse Data Store for long-term access."

N.; Durning, S. J.; Artino, A. R.",Lauren A Maggio,2019-10-02,scientific communication and education,"Biomedical researchers have lamented the lengthy timelines from manuscript submission to publication and highlighted potential detrimental effects on scientific progress and scientists careers. In 2015, Himmelstein identified the mean time from manuscript submission to acceptance in biomedicine as approximately 100 days. The length of publication timelines in health professions education (HPE) is currently unknown.\n\nThis study replicates Himmelsteins work with a sample of 14 HPE journals published between 2008-2018. Using PubMed, 19,182 article citations were retrieved. Open metadata for each was downloaded, including the date the article was received by the journal, the date the authors resubmitted revisions, the date the journal accepted the article, and date of entry into PubMed. Journals without publication history metadata were excluded.\n\nPublication history data was available for 55% (n=8) of the journals sampled. The publication histories of 4,735 (25%) articles were analyzed. Mean time from: (1) author submission to journal acceptance was 180.93 days (SD=103.89), (2) author submission to posting on PubMed was 263.55 days (SD=157.61), and (3) journal acceptance to posting on PubMed was 83.15 days (SD=135.72).\n\nThis study presents publication metadata for journals that openly provide it--a first step towards understanding publication timelines in HPE. Findings confirm the replicability of the original study, and the limited data suggest that, in comparison to biomedical scientists broadly, medical educators may experience longer wait times for article acceptance and publication. Reasons for these delays are currently unknown and deserve further study; such work would be facilitated by increased public access to journal metadata.\n\nWhat this article addsPublication delays can negatively impact science and researchers careers. A previous study, in biomedicine, leveraged publicly available data to identify a 100-day waiting period between manuscript submission and acceptance. However, this study provides limited information on timelines for health professions education (HPE) articles. Thus, the current study replicates the original investigation with publication timeline data for eight HPE journals, which make their data publicly accessible, finding the mean time from submission to acceptance to be 181 days. Reasons for these delays are currently unknown and deserve further study; such work would be facilitated by increased public access to journal metadata."

Our aim was to measure pupil diameter response to anomalies of varying levels of difficulty in expert and student dentists visual examination of panoramic radiographs. We found that students pupil diameter dilated significantly from baseline compared to experts, but anomaly difficulty had no effect on pupillary response. In contrast, experts pupil diameter responded to varying levels of anomaly difficulty, where more difficult anomalies evoked greater pupil dilation from baseline. Experts thus showed proportional pupillary response indicative of increasing cognitive load with increasingly difficult anomalies, whereas students showed pupillary response indicative of higher cognitive load for all anomalies when compared to experts."

M.; Schlueter, A.; Anggraini, E.",Katherine M Nelson,2019-10-04,scientific communication and education,"Anecdotal evidence from philanthropic fundraisers shows that virtual reality (VR) technology increases empathy and can influence people toward pro-environmental behavior. Non-profit organizations are increasingly marketing their causes using virtual reality and they report increased donations when VR technology is employed. In VR, users are immersed in situations intended to feel more like the real world through technology, such as 360{degrees} video screened through 3D headsets that block out visual and auditory distractions. The framing of the message as either positive or negative has long shown to have an effect on behavior, although consensus on the impact of framing has not been reached in relation to encouraging contributions to public goods. This paper focuses on field experiments used to investigate the effects of varying degrees of visual immersion and positive versus negative message framing on respondents contributions to a conservation charity. Participants were exposed to a five-minute underwater film about coral reefs and the importance of protecting them. We employed a 2x2 experimental design using 3D head-mounted displays comparing 360{degrees} film footage vs. unidirectional film and a positive message vs. a negative message. After watching the film, each participant completed a short questionnaire and had the opportunity to donate to a marine conservation charity. In addition, we tested a control treatment where no video was observed. The video was filmed in Indonesia which is host to some of the worlds most biodiverse reefs that are under great threat from human activity. We also conducted the study in Indonesia, sampling a total of 1006 participants from the Bogor city area and tourists on the island of Gili Trawangan - which is popular for scuba diving and snorkeling. We find significant differences in observed behavior and reported emotions between all treatments compared to the control condition. Among the tourist sample, we find significant differences between the 360{degrees} film with a negative message which garnered significantly larger average donation amounts compared to the unidirectional film with both positive and negative framing. Overall, we can infer from these studies that virtual reality is an effective way to raise awareness of environmental threats and encourage behavioral action, especially when tailored to target groups. New technology, such as the VR head-mounted display, is highly effective at attracting interest which is an important point to encourage organizations to invest in new technologies."

M.; Libertucci, J.",Ada K Hagan,2019-10-04,scientific communication and education,"The biomedical sciences have a problem retaining white women and underrepresented minorities in academia. Despite increases in the representation of these groups in faculty candidate pools, they are still underrepresented at the faculty level, particularly at the Full Professor level. The lack of diverse individuals at the Full Professor level contributes to the attrition of women and under-represented minorities, as it confirms unconscious biases. The presence of unconscious biases contribute to feelings of not belonging by trainees and are amplified by visual representation of who is presented as the \""top scientist in their field\"". Top scientists are not only defined by the attainment of Full Professorships, but also through invited seminar series. Invitations for faculty to present their research at other university departments is highly valued offer that provides an opportunity for collaborations and networking. However, if invited speakers do not represent the demographics of current trainees, these visual representations of successful scientists may contribute to decreased attitudes of self-identification as a scientist, ultimately resulting in trainees leaving the field or the academy. In this study, we compare invited-speaker demographics to the current trainee demographics in one microbiology and immunology department and find that trainees are not proportionally represented by speakers invited to the department. Our investigation prompted changes in policy for how invited speakers are selected in the future to invite a more diverse group of scientists. To facilitate this process, we developed a set of tips and a web-based resource that allows scientists, committees, and moderators to identify members of under-served groups. These resources can be easily adapted by other fields or sub-fields to promote inclusion and diversity at seminar series, conferences, and colloquia."

The surface coating with the different PEG6000 was studied by AFM. The surface coating as well as the physicochemical characterization showed only small differences in mass and hydrodynamic radius between the different PEGs. A direct coating of the cells with PEG from two distributors indicate that the spheroid formation in due to direct interaction of the polymer with the cell rather than by interaction of cells with the coated surface.\n\nThe experiments point out that for biological entities, such as cells or tissues, even very small differences such as impurities or batch-to-batch variations in the purchased product can have a very strong impact."

In general, the goal of PD programs is that participants continue to practice what they learn in the long term. However, we do not know the degree to which the outcomes of these programs were achieved and ultimately persist. We tracked postdoc participants from the Faculty Institutes for Reformed Science Teaching (FIRST) IV program into their current position as early-career faculty at institutions across the United States. We assessed their teaching approaches, practices, and student perceptions of the learning environment over 6-10 years. Additionally, the FIRST IV faculty were paired with colleagues of similar status in the same departments. We found that professional development outcomes from the FIRST IV program persisted over time and across a significant career transition, from postdoc to faculty. These participants not only maintained their student-centered practices, but were significantly more student-focused than their peers. Lastly, we found that faculty approaches to teaching were correlated with observed teaching practices in the classroom for both groups of faculty. These results provide compelling evidence for the success of the FIRST IV program and the long-term persistence of professional development outcomes."

A specific challenge is duplication, that is, the presence of redundancy (records with high similarity) or inconsistency (dissimilar records that correspond to the same entity). The characteristics (which records are duplicates), impact (why duplicates are significant), and solutions (how to address duplication), are not well understood. Studies on the topic are neither recent nor comprehensive. In addition, other data quality issues, such as inconsistencies and inaccuracies, are also of concern in the context of biological databases. A primary focus of this paper is to present and consolidate the opinions of over 20 experts and practitioners on the topic of duplication in biological sequence databases. The results reveal that survey participants believe that duplicate records are diverse; that the negative impacts of duplicates are severe, while positive impacts depend on correct identification of duplicates; and that duplicate detection methods need to be more precise, scalable, and robust. A secondary focus is to consider other quality issues. We observe that biocuration is the key mechanism used to ensure the quality of this data, and explore the issues through a case study of curation in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot as well as an interview with an experienced biocurator. While biocuration is a vital solution for handling of data quality issues, a broader community effort is needed to provide adequate support for thorough biocuration in the face of widespread quality concerns."

C.",Brian C O'Meara,2019-10-05,scientific communication and education,"Achieving a high-quality reconstruction of a phylogenetic tree with branch lengths proportional to absolute time (chronogram) is a difficult and time-consuming task. But the increased availability of fossil and molecular data, and time-efficient analytical techniques has resulted in many recent publications of large chronograms for a large number and wide diversity of organisms. Knowledge of the evolutionary time frame of organisms is key for research in the natural sciences. It also represent valuable information for education, science communication, and policy decisions. When chronograms are shared in public and open databases, this wealth of expertly-curated and peer-reviewed data on evolutionary timeframe is exposed in a programatic and reusable way, as intensive and localized efforts have improved data sharing practices, as well as incentivizited open science in biology. Here we present DateLife, a service implemented as an R package and an R Shiny website application available at www.datelife.org, that provides functionalities for efficient and easy finding, summary, reuse, and reanalysis of expert, peer-reviewed, public data on time frame of evolution. The main DateLife workflow constructs a chronogram for any given combination of taxon names by searching a local chronogram database constructed and curated from the Open Tree of Life Phylesystem phylogenetic database, which incorporates phylogenetic data from the TreeBASE database as well. We implement and test methods for summarizing time data from multiple source chronograms using supertree and congruification algorithms, and using age data extracted from source chronograms as secondary calibration points to add branch lengths proportional to absolute time to a tree topology. DateLife will be useful to increase awareness of the existing variation in alternative hypothesis of evolutionary time for the same organisms, and can foster exploration of the effect of alternative evolutionary timing hypotheses on the results of downstream analyses, providing a framework for a more informed interpretation of evolutionary results."

A higher production of protein, however, might contribute for the depletion of environmental resources. In this scenario, the use of insects as an alternative source of protein to feed animals could be a solution. However, citizens willingness-to-accept insect as a source of protein to feed animals is unknown, particularly in developing countries, such as Brazil. The aim of this study was to investigate the factors influencing citizens willingness-to-accept the use of insects to feed poultry, cattle, pig and fish. To reach this aim, we conducted an online survey with Brazilian citizens. We analyzed the data using descriptive statistics and four logistic regression models. In each of logistic models, the dependent variable was citizens willingness-to-accept the use of insects to feed either poultry, or cattle, or pig or fish. A set of independent variables including socio-demographic characteristics, attitudes, perceived benefits, perceived risks, and perceived concerns were used to explain citizens' willingness-to-accept the use of insect to feed animals. Results showed that most citizens would accept that poultry, pig, and fish receive insect-based diets, and half of the citizens would accept and half would not accept that cattle receive such diet. Results of the logistic regression models showed that citizens who had a positive attitude about using insects to feed animals were more willing-to-accept the use of insect to feed poultry, cattle, pig, and fish compared to those who had a negative attitude. Citizens who perceived the benefits of using insect to feed animals were less willing-to-accept the use of insects to feed poultry compared to those who didnt perceive the benefits. Citizens who perceived the benefits of using insects to feed animals were more willing-to-accept the use of insect to feed fish compared to those who didnt perceive the benefits. Citizens who were more concerned about using insect to feed animals were more willing-to-accept the use of insects to feed poultry compared to those who were less concerned. Finally, citizens who were more concerned about using insects to feed animals were less willing-to-accept the use of insect to feed pigs compared to those who were less concerned. These results revealed important insights that can be used to design strategies to increase the acceptance of the use of insects to feed poultry, cattle, pig, and fish."

Overall, increasing age (AOR=2.44[95%CI=1.27-4.70] at 40-49 years vs. AOR=4.14[95%CI=1.97-8.69] at 60 years and above) and Indian ethnicity (AOR=1.95[95%CI=1.12-3.38)] increased, while higher education (AOR = 0.44[95%CI = 0.20-0.94] reduced the odds of MetS in this population. Quick finishing of meals (AOR=2.17[95%CI=1.02-4.60]) and low physical activity (AOR=4.76[95%CI=1.49-15.26]) was associated with an increased odds of MetS among the Malays and Chinese, respectively.\n\nConclusionThe population in Johor is diverse in these factors, and some of these are associated with MetS in certain ethnicities. In light of such differences, ethnic specific measures are needed to reduce the prevalence of MetS in this population."

A.; Dimbuene, Z. T.; Kimani-Murage, E. W.",Dickson  Abanimi  Amugsi,2019-10-08,scientific communication and education,"This study examined the factors associated with normal linear growth among pre-school children living in better-off households, using survey data from Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Mozambique and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The primary outcome variable was child height-for-age z-scores (HAZ), categorised into HAZ[&ge;]-2SD (normal growth/not stunted) and HAZ<-2 (stunted). Using logistic regression, we estimated adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of the factors associated with normal growth. Higher maternal weight (measured by body mass index) was associated with increased odds of normal growth in Mozambique, DRC, Kenya and Nigeria. A unit increase in maternal years of education was associated with increased odds in normal growth in DRC (aOR=1.06, 95% CI=1.03, 1.09), Ghana (aOR=1.08, 95% CI=1.04, 1.12), Mozambique (aOR=1.08, 95% CI=1.05, 1.11) and Nigeria (aOR=1.07, 95% CI=1.06, 1.08). A year increase in maternal age was positively associated with normal growth in all the five countries. Breastfeeding was associated with increased odds of normal growth in Nigeria (aOR= 1.30, 95% CI=1.16, 1.46) and Kenya (aOR=1.37, 95% CI=1.05, 1.79). Children of working mothers had 25% (aOR=0.75, 95% CI=0.60, 0.93) reduced odds of normal growth in DRC. A unit change in maternal parity was associated with 10% (aOR=0.90, 95% CI=0.84, 0.97), 23% (aOR=0.77, 95% CI=0.63, 0.93), 25% (aOR=0.75, 95% CI=0.69, 0.82), 6% (aOR=0.94, 95% CI=0.89, 0.99) and 5% (aOR=0.95, 95% CI=0.92, 0.99) reduced odds of normal growth in DRC, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique and Nigeria respectively. A child being a male was associated with 16% (aOR=0.82, 95% CI=0.68, 0.98), 40% (aOR=0.60, 95% CI=0.40, 0.89), 37% (aOR=0.63, 95% CI=0.51, 0.77) and 21% (aOR=0.79, 95% CI=0.71, 0.87) reduced odds of normal child growth in DRC, Ghana, Kenya and Nigeria respectively. In conclusion, maternal education, weight, age, breastfeeding and antenatal care are positively associated with normal child growth, while maternal parity, employment, and child sex and age are associated negatively with normal growth. Interventions to improve child growth should take into account these differential effects."

This study analyses the number of papers available as OA over time. The models includes both OA embargo data and the relative growth rates of different OA types over time, based on the OA status of 70 million journal articles published between 1950 and 2019.

The study also looks at article usage data, analyzing the proportion of views to OA articles vs views to articles which are closed access. Signal processing techniques are used to model how these viewership patterns change over time. Viewership data is based on 2.8 million uses of the Unpaywall browser extension in July 2019.

We found that Green, Gold, and Hybrid papers receive more views than their Closed or Bronze counterparts, particularly Green papers made available within a year of publication. We also found that the proportion of Green, Gold, and Hybrid articles is growing most quickly.

In 2019: O_LI31% of all journal articles are available as OA
C_LIO_LI52% of article views are to OA articles
C_LI

Given existing trends, we estimate that by 2025: O_LI44% of all journal articles will be available as OA
C_LIO_LI70% of article views will be to OA articles

S.; Pejaver, V.; Symmons, O.; Bisson Filho, A. W.; Haage, A.",Amanda  Haage,2019-10-09,scientific communication and education,"Applying for a faculty position is a critical phase of many postdoctoral careers, but most postdoctoral researchers in STEM fields enter the academic job market with little knowledge of the process and expectations. A lack of data has made it difficult for applicants to assess their qualifications relative to the general applicant pool and for institutions to develop effective hiring policies. We analyzed responses to a survey of faculty job applicants between May 2018 and May 2019. We establish various background scholarly metrics for a typical faculty applicant and present an analysis of the interplay between those metrics and hiring outcomes. Traditional benchmarks of a positive research track record above a certain threshold of qualifications were unable to completely differentiate applicants with and without offers. Our findings suggest that there is no single clear path to a faculty job offer and that metrics such as career transition awards and publications in high impact factor journals were neither necessary nor sufficient for landing a faculty position. The applicants perceived the process as unnecessarily stressful, time-consuming, and largely lacking in feedback, irrespective of a successful outcome. Our findings emphasize the need to improve the transparency of the faculty job application process. In addition, we hope these and future data will help empower trainees to enter the academic job market with clearer expectations and improved confidence."

Given the speed of technology development, and the almost instantaneous global spread of news, its important to follow evolving debates without much delay and in sufficient detail, as certain events may have a major long-term impact on public opinion and later influence policy decisions. Social media networks such as Twitter have shown to be major drivers of news dissemination and public discourse. They provide a vast amount of semi-structured data in almost real-time and give direct access to the content of the conversations. Such data can now be mined and analyzed quickly because of recent developments in machine learning and natural language processing. Here, we used BERT, an attention-based transformer model, in combination with statistical methods to analyse the entirety of all tweets ever published on CRISPR since the publication of the first gene editing application in 2013. We show that the mean sentiment of tweets was initially very positive, but began to decrease over time, and that this decline was driven by rare peaks of strong negative sentiments. Due to the high temporal resolution of the data, we were able to associate these peaks with specific events, and to observe how trending topics changed over time. Overall, this type of analysis can provide valuable and complementary insights into ongoing public debates, extending the traditional empirical bioethics toolset."

U.; Specht, L.; Struck, M.; Tragert, S.; Walther, T.; Klemperer, D.",Peter R Grabitz,2019-10-18,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundMost medical students are in contact with the pharmaceutical or medical device industry during their studies. Medical schools play an important role in protecting students from undue commercial influence and educating them about pharmaceutical marketing practices. Such influence has been shown to affect later prescribing behaviour with potential adverse effects for patient care. While in North America, many medical schools formulated and implemented conflicts of interest (COI) policies, only few such institutional policies have been reported in Germany. We aimed to analyze the quantity and quality of policies and curricula on COI at medical schools across Germany.

MethodsWe collected relevant COI policies and teaching activities by conducting a search of the websites of all 38 German medical schools using standardized keywords for COI policies and teaching. Further, we surveyed all medical schools deans offices and adapted a scoring system for obtained results with 13 categories based on prior similar studies.

ResultsWe identified relevant policies for one medical school via the web-search. The response rate of the deans survey was 16 of 38 (42.1%). In total, we identified COI-related policies for 2 of 38 (5.3%) German medical schools, yet no policy was sufficient to address all COI-related categories that were assessed in this study. The maximum score achieved was 12 of 26. 36 (94.7%) schools scored 0. No medical school reported curricular teaching on COI.

ConclusionOur results indicate a low level of action by medical schools to protect students from undue commercial influence. No participating dean was aware of any curriculum or instruction on COI at their respective school. The German Medical Students Association and international counterparts have called for a stronger focus on COI in the classroom. We conclude that for German medical schools there is still a long way to go."

Therefore, exploratory studies to address chemo-resistance through various approaches are highly rewarding. Nanomedicine is a promising recent advancement in this direction. Comprehensive studies to understand the precise molecular interactions of nanomaterials is necessary to validate their specific ""nano induced"" effects. Here, we illustrate in detail the specific biological interactions of vanadium pentoxide nanoparticles (VnNp) on triple-negative breast cancer cells and provide initial insights towards its potential in breast cancer management at the cellular level. VnNp shows a time-dependent anti-oxidant and pro-oxidant property in vitro. These nanoparticles specifically accumulate in the lysosomes and mitochondria, modulate various cellular processes including impaired lysosomal function, mitochondrial damage, and induce autophagy. At more extended periods, VnNp influences cell cycle arrest and inhibits cell migration potentiating the onset of apoptosis. Preliminary in vivo studies, on exposing healthy Swiss albino mice to VnNp demonstrated normal blood parameters, organ distribution, and tissue redox balance which further indicated the absence of any adverse organ toxicity. Hence, we foresee tumor-targeting VnNp as a potential drug molecule for future cancer management."

P.; Moher, D.",David  Moher,2019-10-21,scientific communication and education,"ObjectivesTo determine the presence of a set of pre-specified traditional and progressive criteria used to assess scientists for promotion and tenure in faculties of biomedical sciences among universities worldwide.

DesignCross-sectional study.

SettingNot applicable.

Participants170 randomly selected universities from the Leiden Ranking of world universities list were considered.

Main outcome measuresTwo independent reviewers searched for all guidelines applied when assessing scientists for promotion and tenure for institutions with biomedical faculties. Where faculty-level guidelines were not available, institution-level guidelines were sought. Available documents were reviewed and the presence of 5 traditional (e.g., number of publications) and 7 progressive (e.g., data sharing) criteria was noted in guidelines for assessing assistant professors, associate professors, professors, and the granting of tenure.

ResultsA total of 146 institutions had faculties of biomedical sciences with 92 having eligible guidelines available to review. Traditional criteria were more commonly reported than progressive criteria (t(82)= 15.1, p= .001). Traditional criteria mentioned peer-reviewed publications, authorship order, journal impact, grant funding, and national or international reputation in 95%, 37%, 28%, 67%, and 48% of the guidelines, respectively. Conversely, among progressive criteria only citations (any mention in 26%) and accommodations for extenuating circumstances (37%) were relatively commonly mentioned; while there was rare mention of alternative metrics for sharing research (2%) and data sharing (1%), and 3 criteria (publishing in open access mediums, registering research, and adhering to reporting guidelines) were not found in any institution reviewed. We observed notable differences across continents on whether guidelines are accessible or not (Australia 100%, North America 97%, Europe 50%, Asia 58%, South America 17%), and more subtle differences on the use of specific criteria.

ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that the current evaluation of scientists emphasizes traditional criteria as opposed to progressive criteria. This may reinforce research practices that are known to be problematic while insufficiently supporting the conduct of better-quality research and open science. Institutions should consider incentivizing progressive criteria.

C.; Ferraz, L. R.; Correa, T. D.",Thiago  Domingos  Corrêa,2019-10-21,scientific communication and education,"IntroductionHandover is a process of transferring information, responsibility and authority for providing care of critically ill patients from a departing intensivist to an oncoming intensivist. The effect of i admission during a medical handover on clinical outcomes is unknown.

ObjectivesOur purpose was to evaluate the impact of ICU admission during a medical handover on clinical outcomes.

MethodsPost hoc analysis of a cohort study addressing the effect of ICU admissions during the handover on outcomes. This retrospective, single center, propensity matched cohort study was conducted in a 41-bed open general ICU located in a private tertiary care hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Based on time of ICU admission, patients were categorized into two cohorts: handover group (ICU admission between 6:30 am to 7:30 or 6:30 pm to 7:30 pm) or control group (admission between 7:31 am to 6:29 pm or 7:31 pm to 6:29 am). Patients in the handover group were propensity matched to patients in the control group at 1:2 ratio. Our primary outcome was hospital mortality.

ResultsBetween June 1, 2013 and May 31, 2015, 6,650 adult patients were admitted to the ICU. Following exclusion of ineligible participants, 5,779 patients [389 (6.7%) in handover group and 5390 (93.3%) in control group] were eligible for propensity score matching, of whom 1,166 were successfully matched [389 (33.4%) handover group and 777 (66.6%) in control group]. Before matching, hospital mortality was 14.1% (55/389 patients) in handover group compared to 11.7% (628/5,390) in control group (p=0.142). After propensity-score matching, ICU admission during handover was not associated with increased risk of ICU (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 0.92 to 2.11; p=0.11) and hospital (OR, 1.23; 95%CI, 0.85 to 1.75; p=0.26) mortality. ICU and hospital length of stay did not differ between the groups.

ConclusionIn this propensity-matched single center cohort study, ICU admission during medical handover did not affect clinical outcomes."

Patient education during the waiting period plays an essential role in promoting health and improving patient satisfaction rates.

ObjectiveTo promote health by educating patients and their companions during their waiting period at the King Fahad Medical City (KFMC) Hospital, Riyadh, with the help of nurses and assess their satisfaction rate.

MethodsA cross-sectional study, including patients and their companions in the waiting rooms of the various OPDs, was conducted. Group teaching sessions were conducted, followed by the assessment of patient and nurse satisfaction rate, and compliance rate using evaluation forms. Pre-implementation surveys were conducted to assess the drawbacks, based on which procedure was modified, and feedback was recorded using an electronic iPad. Data were collected with the help of questionnaires filled at the end of each teaching session and analyzed using descriptive analysis. Results of both the assessment and re-assessment were compared in terms of the number of attendees.

ResultsThere was an improvement in number of attendees (4362 vs. 3392), patient satisfaction rate (90% vs. 78%), nurse satisfaction rate (83.09% vs. 33.18%) and compliance rate (100% vs. 65%) post-modifications. Few loopholes in terms of inappropriate environment and time of the lecture were also observed.

ConclusionThe health educators can assist people in achieving their health goals by organizing structured health education activities, providing appropriate health education materials, and effective training. However, the satisfaction rates of people and health educators should be assessed by conducting routine feedback surveys."
10.1101/815134,Quantification of soy-based feed ingredient entry to the United States by ocean freight shipping and the associated seaports.,"Patterson, G. R.; Niederwerder, M.; Dee, S.",Gilbert  R  Patterson,2019-10-22,scientific communication and education,"The potential of feed ingredients to serve as vehicles for African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV) introduction to the US is a significant concern. ASFV DNA has been detected in the Chinese feed system; raw grains and meals drying on the ground and milling facilities and feed delivery vehicles. Experimental evidence of ASFV survival in multiple soy-based feed ingredients during a simulated 30-day transoceanic journey and the transmission of ASFV through the natural consumption of contaminated feed has been published. Therefore, its important to understand the quantity of soy-based ingredients that enter the US from ASFV-positive countries via ocean shipping and rank sea ports of Entry (POEs) according to annual volume of these products to manage this risk.

The quantity of soy-based feed ingredients and their specific ports of entry was obtained at the International Trade Commission Harmonized Tariff Schedule website (www.hs.usitc.gov), a publically available website that provides a transaction of specific trade commodities between the US and its international trading partners. A close review of this database identified 10 HTS codes pertaining to soy-based feed ingredients, including soybeans, soybean meal, soy oil cake and soy oil. Specific queries on these 10 HTS codes were designed to provide information on country of origin, quantity of product, date of entry, and POE into the US. Data were exported into Microsoft Excel, then organized into pivot tables that described the quantity of specific product by country of origin and POE. The analysis focused on the 43 ASFV-positive countries on the Canadian Food Inspection Agency Watch List.

In 2018, 104,707 metric tons (MT) of soy-based ingredients were imported to the US from a total of nine foreign countries that are included on the CFIA Watch List. 52.6 % of this volume that was imported, or 55,101 MT, originated from China. These soy-based products from China entered the US from a total of 13 separate ports of entry (POEs). Of these POEs, a total of 4 POEs received greater than 88% of all of soy-based ingredients originating from CHina, including San Francisco/Oakland, CA (60.36%), Seattle, WA (20.54%), Baltimore, MD (4.13%), and Los Angeles, CA (3.78%).

This is a new approach to analyze the risk management of feed imports, focusing on seaport of highest risk and quantity of product received. This work represents an initial step towards building a comprehensive listing of imported products introduced into the pork supply chain, and provide a roadmap to understanding risks involved in global livestock feed ingredient sourcing."

Therefore, improving the teaching of medical statistics to meet the requirements of modern medical students/physicians is an essential task. In this study, based on responses about studying medical statistics completed by medical students, we developed a novel approach to teaching medical statistics named ""purpose, database, types of variable, and relationship between variables (PDTR)"", which emphasizes how to simply master statistical applications and reduces class hours for students. Also, pilot course was implemented. We discovered that the participants using PDTR performed better on examinations of medical statistics than did graduates of institutions using traditional teaching methods (86.39{+/-}3.72 vs 73.72{+/-}6.58, P < 0.001). In addition, positive feedback was received by participants (>80%). Altogether, as a completely novel pedagogical method of teaching medical statistics, PDTR overcomes the negative attitudes of students towards medical statistics, enhances enthusiasm for learning statistics, and remarkably simplifies the process of studying statistical applications. These advantages are undoubtedly conductive to improving the effective use of medical statistics in physicians professional work."

ObjectivesTo explore influences on pregnant womens decision making around alcohol use in a population with frequent and heavy peer drinking (i.e. in two Indigenous Australian communities) and another of non-Indigenous pregnant women attending antenatal care in a range of socioeconomic settings.

MethodsIndividual and group discussions were held with both Indigenous Australian and non-Indigenous pregnant women attending a variety of antenatal care models, including two Indigenous maternity services in Australia. Data were analysed using inductive content analysis.

ResultsA total of 14 Indigenous Australian and 14 non-Indigenous pregnant women participated in this study. Analysis identified five main influences on pregnant womens alcohol use: the level and detail of womens understanding of harm; womens information sources on alcohol use in pregnancy; how this information influenced their choices; how women conceptualised their pregnancy; and whether the social and cultural environment supported abstinence.

Conclusions for practiceThis study provides insight into how Indigenous Australian and non-Indigenous pregnant women understand and conceptualise the harms from drinking alcohol, including how their social and cultural environments impact their ability to abstain. Strategies for behaviour change need to: correct misinformation about supposed  safe timing, quantity and types of alcohol; develop a more accurate perception of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder; reframe messages about harm to messages about optimising the childs health and cognitive outcomes; and develop a holistic approach encompassing womens social and cultural context."

In this work, we analyzed the knowledge, perception, and interaction of a local community located in the forest reserve of Quinini (RFPCQ) in Cundinamarca (Colombia), with respect to the herpetofauna that inhabits the area.

MethodsWe performed semi-structured surveys containing 30 questions categorized into three groups: academic knowledge (1), use and cultural beliefs (2) and interaction and perception (3) related to the herpetofauna that occurs in the region. For the obtained data in question groups 1 and 2, an analysis and classification of the answers in percentages were made. For the question group 3, we assigned the answers with a hostility value according to the possible reaction of each individual interviewed in a hypothetical encounter with the herpetofauna, and performed a Multivariate Ordinal Logistic Regression test (MOLR), in order to know if the positive or negative reactions could be predicted by demographic variables.

ResultsThe community recognized the presence of amphibians and reptiles that cohabit their space, as well as their potential habitats. In addition, the role of herpetofauna was recognized in the magical/religious traditions for some inhabitants of the region, mainly associated with the fate and cure of chronic diseases. In general, the perception of amphibians and reptiles varied according to the origin and gender of the people, tend to have a more positive perception about reptiles than amphibians in most cases.

ConclusionsAlthough there was a general lack of knowledge on the part of the inhabitants of the RFPCQ about the biological and ecological aspects of herpetofauna, the population recognized the basic information about the habitats of these animals within the area of the reserve. There is a wide variety of uses of amphibians and reptiles in traditional medicine. Greater efforts should be made in the transmission and dissemination of knowledge about the ecological functions of herpetofauna."

Here, we present an interactive web application called ""Right Place, Right Tree - Boston"" that aims to support informed decision-making for planting new trees. To highlight priority regions for canopy expansion, we developed a Boston-specific Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI) and present this alongside maps of summer temperatures. We also provide information about tree pests and diseases, suitability of species for various conditions, land ownership, maintenance tips, and alternatives to tree planting."

The battle towards equal voting rights took approximately 100 years to win, and went until the 19th Century. It was only around 1902-1920 that women got equal voting rights in prominent Western countries followed by others. Amidst the celebration of  womens vote centenary throughout the world, the issue of equal rights to education and work is still waiting for the proper attention. Historically the presence of women in educational, technological and scientific fields remains mostly marginal. In this article, the current state of under-representation of women in the science and technology community is depicted, primarily highlighting the Indian scenario. It is observed that throughout India, and amongst the relatively developed countries of the world, the presence of women in highly prestigious Institutes and Universities remains negligible even in this day and age. The probable causes behind such inequality need to be analyzed, addressed and looked upon for remedial purposes."

A.",Julie A Gazmararian,2019-11-01,scientific communication and education,"Aim/PurposeTodays biomedical researchers are expected to apply understanding of basic biology to improve human health. Meeting this goal requires mastery of both laboratory and population sciences, each of which has its own knowledge base, techniques, and training paradigms.

BackgroundEmory Universitys ""Molecules-to-Mankind"" (M2M) doctoral pathway was established in 2009 to be an evolving model of interdisciplinary PhD education. M2M supplements fellows home programs, ensuring they receive training in both population and laboratory sciences.

MethodologyThe present paper describes the M2M program in detail. Surveys of faculty and fellows were also carried out, and the results are presented herein.

ContributionThe M2M program follows a unique model by which doctoral students receive training in both population and laboratory sciences. The present paper describes this model, such that the information can be disseminated to other educational institutions interested in implementing similar programs.

FindingsThis unique model facilitates engagement of stakeholders including the fellows home program, dissertation advisor, and Emorys professional schools. Recruited across biomedical PhD and MD/PhD programs, fellows have diverse research experiences and represent ""spokes"" bound together by the M2M ""hub."" This hubs central feature is a weekly seminar class where fellows and faculty members gather for open discussion with interdisciplinary speakers with successful research careers, emphasizing speakers who have tied laboratory and population sciences in their own work. This forum provides an encouraging environment for dialogue on all aspects of biomedical research from the science itself, to the speakers career path, and the logistics of garnering institutional support and building transdisciplinary collaborations. A decade since its inception, M2M has a proven track record of shaping early-stage careers for its 49 alumni to date.

Recommendations for PractitionersEngaging trainees outside their home doctoral programs can have positive implications on overall quality of education.

Recommendation for ResearchersAs interdisciplinary models grow ever more important in biomedical sciences, it is important to further examine the best teaching methods for training the next generation of scientists.

Impact on SocietyInterdisciplinary training at the doctoral level is important to produce future cohorts of engaged and versatile scientific leaders.

Future ResearchFuture research should continue to explore novel methods of training graduate students at the doctoral level."

R.",Richard Sever,2019-11-06,scientific communication and education,"The traditional publication process delays dissemination of new research, often by months, sometimes by years. Preprint servers decouple dissemination of research papers from their evaluation and certification by journals, allowing researchers to share work immediately, receive feedback from a much larger audience, and provide evidence of productivity long before formal publication. Launched in 2013 as a non-profit community service, the bioRxiv server has brought preprint practice to the life sciences and recently posted its 64,000th manuscript. The server now receives more than four million views per month and hosts papers spanning all areas of biology. Initially dominated by evolutionary biology, genetics/genomics and computational biology, bioRxiv has been increasingly populated by papers in neuroscience, cell and developmental biology, and many other fields. Changes in journal and funder policies that encourage preprint posting have helped drive adoption, as has the development of bioRxiv technologies that allow authors to transfer papers easily between the server and journals. A bioRxiv user survey found that 42% of authors post their preprints prior to journal submission whereas 37% post concurrently with journal submission. Authors are motivated by a desire to share work early; they value the feedback they receive, and very rarely experience any negative consequences of preprint posting. Rapid dissemination via bioRxiv is also encouraging new initiatives that experiment with the peer review process and the development of novel approaches to literature filtering and assessment."

The Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP) is an endeavor to generate 3-dimensional (3D) molecular atlases of healthy and diseased kidney biopsies using multiple state-of-the-art OMICS and imaging technologies across several institutions. Obtaining rigorous and reproducible results from disparate methods and at different sites to interrogate biomolecules at a single cell level or in 3D space is a significant challenge that can be a futile exercise if not well controlled. We describe a ""follow the tissue"" pipeline for generating a reliable and authentic single cell/region 3D molecular atlas of human adult kidney. Our approach emphasizes quality assurance, quality control, validation and harmonization across different OMICS and imaging technologies from sample procurement, processing, storage, shipping to data generation, analysis and sharing. We established benchmarks for quality control, rigor, reproducibility and feasibility across multiple technologies through a pilot experiment using common source tissue that was processed and analyzed at different institutions and different technologies. A peer review system was established to critically review quality control measures and the reproducibility of data generated by each technology before being approved to interrogate clinical biopsy specimens. The process established economizes the use of valuable biopsy tissue for multi-OMICS and imaging analysis with stringent quality control to ensure rigor and reproducibility of results and serves as a model for precision medicine projects across laboratories, institutions and consortia."

The present study was constructed on twelve native breeds of rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and eighteen adult domestic cats (Felis catus domesticus). We concluded that, in brief; the rabbit gall bladder was relatively small, fixed by several small hepato-cystic ducts to its fossa. The rabbit bile duct was formed commonly by the junction of the left hepatic duct and the cystic duct. The cystic duct was commonly fairly large, received the right hepatic duct that collected the right lobe in its route to enter the duodenum, the bile duct receives the branch of the caudate process of the caudate lobe. The present study revealed other four anatomic variations dealing with the shape and size of the feline native breeds gall bladder from fundic duplication, bilobed, truncated fundus and distended rounded fundus. Commonly, the bile duct was formed by the triple convergence of the left and the right hepatic ducts with the cystic duct. However, in some exceptional cases a short common hepatic duct was formed. Sonographically, the normal gall bladder in rabbit appeared small, elongated with anechoic lumen bordered by right lobe laterally and quadrate lobe medially and has no visible wall, but in cat varied in conformation, bordered by the right medial lobe laterally and the quadrate lobe medially surrounded by echogenic wall."

The prevalence of CKDu is reportedly highest among communities that engage in chena and paddy farming, which is most often practiced in the dry zone including the North Central and East Central Provinces of Sri Lanka. Previous studies have suggested varied hypotheses for the etiology of CKDu; however, there is not yet a consensus on the primary risk factors, possibly due to disparate study designs, sample populations, and methodologies. The goal of this pilot case-control study was to evaluate the relationships between key demographic, cultural, and occupational variables as risk factors for CKDu, with a primary interest in pesticide exposure both occupationally and through its potential use as an ingredient in brewed kasippu alcohol. A total of 56 CKDu cases and 54 control individuals were surveyed using a proctored, self-reported questionnaire. Occupational pesticide exposure and alcohol consumption were not found to be significant risk factors for CKDu. However, a statistically significant association with CKDu was observed with chewing betel (OR: 6.11, 95% CI: 1.93, 19.35), age (OR: 1.07, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.13), owning a pet dog (OR: 3.74, 95% CI: 1.38, 10.11), water treatment (OR: 3.68, 95% CI: 1.09, 12.43) and pests in the house (OR: 5.81, 95% CI: 1.56, 21.60). The findings of this study suggest future research should focus on practices associated with chewing betel, potential animal interactions including pests in the home and pets, and risk factors associated with water.

AUTHOR SUMMARYSince a new variant of chronic kidney disease was acknowledged in the early 1990s among those in the agricultural community of Sri Lanka, especially rice farmers, the research community has searched for causes of what has become known as chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology or CKDu. Previous studies have focused on heavy metals in the environment as they are known to be toxic to the kidneys however, a proverbial ""smoking gun"" has yet to be identified. Understanding that the causes is potential multifactorial we implemented a pilot case-control study using a One Health methodology administering a comprehensive interview to assess environmental, animal, and, human exposures that may be contributing to the diagnosis of CKDu. We found statistically significant odds ratio among those that reported having a pet dog, chewing betel (a traditional preparation or various ingredients wrapped in a betel leaf inserted between the teeth and cheek), pests in the home, treating drinking water, and older age. These results serve to guide further hypothesis generation regarding mechanisms behind associated exposures from infectious diseases such as hantavirus and leptospirosis to food preparation through boiling drinking water in aluminum vessels and oral pesticide exposure linked to betel preparation."

Merton (1957) observed in Priorities in Scientific Discovery: A Chapter in the Sociology of Science that ""what is true of physics, chemistry, astronomy, medicine and mathematics is true also of all the other scientific disciplines, not excluding the social and psychological sciences"". However, consensus over related issues, such as what constitutes plagiarism in these fields cannot be taken for granted. We conducted a comprehensive study on plagiarism views among PhD holders registered in the database of the Brazilian National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq). We collected 25,157 valid responses encompassing views and attitudes toward plagiarism from a probability sample of PhD holders across the fields, including biologists, physicists, mathematicians, and engineers as well as linguists, philosophers and anthropologists. The results suggest that core principles about plagiarism are shared among this multidisciplinary community and that they corroborate Mertons observations. Before this study, we could only speculate that this is the case. With these data from a probability sample of Brazilian academia (PhD holders), this study offers insight into the way plagiarism is perceived across the sciences, including the literature and arts, and sheds light on the problem in the context of international collaborative research networks. The data focus on a young research system in Latin America, but, given the cultural similarities that bind most Latin-American nations, these results may be relevant to other PhD populations in the region and should provide a comparison with studies from other emerging, non-Anglophone regions."

M.",Kelly J Wallace,2019-11-22,scientific communication and education,"While academia is moving forward in terms of diversifying recruitment of undergraduate and graduate students, diverse representation is still not found across the academic hierarchy. At the graduate level, new discussions are emerging around efforts to improve the experiences of women and underrepresented minorities through inclusive graduate programming. Inclusive graduate programs are that which actively center and prioritize support for diverse experiences, identities, career goals, and perspectives, from recruitment through graduation. Establishing regular and rigorous evaluation of equity and inclusion efforts and needs is a critical component of this work. This is recognized by funding agencies that increasingly require reporting on inclusion efforts; here we suggest use of a systems change framework for these evaluations.

A systems change approach emphasizes three levels: explicit change (e.g. policies), semi-explicit change (e.g. power dynamics), and implicit change (e.g. biases). We use the Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior (EEB) PhD Program at the University of Texas at Austin in an exercise to (1) identify areas of concern regarding inclusive programming voiced by graduate students, (2) categorize efforts to address these concerns, and (3) integrating and evaluating which areas of the systems change framework show the greatest progress or potential for progress. We argue this framework is particularly useful for academic systems as they are complex, composed of variable individuals, and must address diverse stakeholder needs."

Contact information, outcome measures, and study design are frequently missing or underspecified. Important fields for search, such as condition and intervention, are not restricted to ontologies, and almost half of the conditions are not denoted by MeSH terms, as recommended. Eligibility criteria are stored as semi-structured free text. Enforcing the presence of all required elements, requiring values for certain fields to be drawn from ontologies, and creating a structured eligibility criteria element would improve the reusability of data from ClinicalTrials.gov in systematic reviews, metanalyses, and matching of eligible patients to trials."

Radiation retinopathy is a potential consequence of treatment, characterized by deleterious effects on retinal microvasculature. We investigated the application of Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) for detecting and longitudinally monitoring I-125 episcleral plaque brachytherapy induced radiation retinopathy.

MethodsHigh resolution OCTA of the central 3x3mm macula were obtained from I-25 episcleral plaque brachytherapy treated and untreated fellow eyes of 62 patients. Capillary density (vessel skeleton density, VSD) and caliber (vessel diameter index, VDI) were quantified using previously validated semi-automated algorithms. Nonperfusion was also quantified as flow impairment regions (FIR). Exams from treated and fellow eyes obtained pre-treatment and at 6-month, 1-year, and 2-year intervals were compared using generalized estimating equation linear models. Dosimetry maps were used to evaluate spatial correlation between radiation dose and microvascular metrics.

ResultsMean time from treatment to last follow-up was 10.8 months. Mean{+/-}SD and median radiation dose at the fovea were 64.5 {+/-} 76 Gy and 32.0 Gy, respectively. Preoperative logMAR (Snellen) mean visual acuity was 0.26 {+/-} 0.05 ([~]20/35) and 0.08 {+/-} 0.02 ([~]20/25) in treated and fellow eyes, respectively. At 6 months, treated eyes had significantly lower VSD (0.147 {+/-} 0.003 vs 0.155 {+/-} 0.002; p = 0.023) and higher FIR (1.95 {+/-} 0.176 vs 1.45 {+/-} 0.099; p = 0.018) compared to fellow eyes. There was a significant decrease in VSD and a corresponding increase in FIR even for treated eyes without clinically identifiable retinopathy at 6 months. VDI was significantly higher in treated eyes than in fellow eyes at 2 years (2.93 {+/-} 0.022 vs 2.84 {+/-} 0.016; p = 0.002). Microvascular changes were spatially correlated with a radiation gradient of 85-250 Gy across the fovea.

ConclusionsOCTA can be used to quantify and monitor EPB induced radiation, and can detect vascular abnormalities even in the absence of clinically observable retinopathy. OCTA may therefore be useful in investigating treatment interventions that aim to delay EPB-induced radiation retinopathy."

J.; Morando, M.",Juan  Vrdoljak,2019-12-02,scientific communication and education,"Replicability of findings is the key factor of scientific reliability. However, literature on this topic is scarce and apparently taboo for large scientific areas. Some authors named the failure to reproduce scientific findings  replication crisis. Geometric morphometrics, a vastly used technique, is especially silent on replication crisis concern. Nevertheless, some works pointed out that sharing morphogeometric information is not a trivial fact, but need to be careful and meticulous. Here, we investigated the replicability of geometric morphometrics protocols on complex shapes and measurement error extension in three different types of taxa, as well as the potentiality of these protocols to discriminate among closely related species. We found a wide range of replication error that contributed from 19.5% to 60% of the total variation. Although, measurement error decreased with the complexity of the quantified shape, it often maintained high values. All protocols were able to discriminate between species, but more morphogeometric information does not imply better performance. We present evidence of replication crisis in life sciences and highlight the need to explore in deep different sources of variation that could lead to low replicability findings. Lastly, we enunciate some recommendations in order to improve the replicability and reliability of scientific findings."

R.; Hagberg, C.; Hagg, S.",Emma R Andersson,2019-12-03,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundAcademic life is highly competitive and expectations of fair competition underlie the assumption that academia is a meritocracy. However, implicit bias reinforces gender inequality in all peer review processes, unfairly eliminating outstanding individuals and depleting academia of diversity. Here, we ask whether applicant gender biases reviewer assessments of merit in Sweden, a country that is top ranked for gender equality.

MethodsWe analyzed the peer review procedure for positions awarded at a Swedish medical University, Karolinska Institutet (KI), during four consecutive years (2014-2017) for Assistant Professor (n=207) and Senior Researcher (n=153). We derived a composite bibliometric score to compute productivity, and compared this to subjective external (non-KI) peer reviewer scores on applicants merits to test their association for men and women, separately.

ResultsMen and women with equal merits are not scored equally by reviewers. Men generally have stronger associations (steeper slopes) between computed productivity and subjective external scores, meaning that peer reviewers suitably ""reward"" mens productivity with increased merit scores. However, for each additional composite bibliometric score point, women applying for Assistant Professor positions only receive 58% (79% for Senior Researcher) of the external reviewer score that men received, confirming that implicit bias affects external reviewers assessments. As productivity increases, the difference in merit scores between men and women increases.

ConclusionsAccumulating bias impacts most strongly in the highest tier of competition, the pool from which successful candidates are ultimately chosen. Gender bias is apparent in external peer review processes of applications for academic positions in Sweden, and is likely to reinforce the unbalanced numbers of professorships in Sweden."

Unmet need for FP suggested that unwanted pregnancy and unsafe abortion are the main causes of maternal mortality in Ethiopia.

ObjectiveTo assess mens involvement in family planning service and associated factors among married men at Debre Tabor Town, Northwest Ethiopia.

MethodsA community based cross-sectional study design was conducted from April to June. 2017 at Debre Tabor Town. Simple random sampling method was recruited then systematic sampling technique was used to include 382 married males. Data were collected by face to face interview using a structured questionnaire. The data were entered into epi. Info 7 and descriptive statistics were analyzed using SPSS version 21 statistical software package.

ResultFrom three hundred eighty-two participants, 373 participants with 97.6% response rate participated in the study. The age range of the participant was from20 to 65years, the mean age was 38.6 with the standard deviation of 7.8. Majority of the participants were orthodox 358(96%). One hundred twenty-four (33.2%) were greater than secondary education and from the occupation, farmers took the least rank 4 (2.4%). The magnitude of male involvement in family planning was 254(68.1%), 370 (99 .2%) of the participants had information on different family planning methods.

Chinese government has taken a series of action on the treatment and management of severe mental disorder (SMD), but the scale of economic burden caused by SMD was still unclear. In this paper, we applied prevalence-based bottom-up approach to estimate the direct and indirect economic burden of SMD in Southwest China from 2014 to 2017. We used the sampled inpatient medical record data of patient with SMD to calculate the total direct cost and estimated the indirect economic burden using human capital approach.The total ecomonic burden of SMD was USD9,733 million and direct burden was contiributed for 7.5% as USD734.5 million in four years total. The growth rate of direct medical cost was declined due to the health policy reform and total cost control policy. The indirect cost was rapidly increased in four years when estimated with DALYs reported in GBD2010 and resulting USD8,998.6 million. We next estimated the indirect burden using sample DALYs and occupation wage cost approach as sensitive analysis. We found that the indirect burden was sensitive to the key variable and the estimation approach, but the estimates share same increasing trend but with different velocity. Our study suggests that SMD in China have posed substantial economic burden at individual and social levels, with the appropriate estimation of total economic burden, our reaserch would attract more attention and be helpful for health resources distribution."

Haas,2019-12-10,scientific communication and education,"Models of political-ecological systems can inform policies for managing ecosystems that contain endangered species. One way to increase the credibility of these models is to subject them to a rigorous suite of data-based statistical assessments. Doing so involves statistically estimating the models parameters, computing confidence intervals for these parameters, determining the models prediction error rate, and assessing its sensitivity to parameter misspecification.

Here, these statistical algorithms along with a method for constructing politically feasible policies from a statistically fitted model, are coded as JavaSpaces programs that run as compute jobs on either supercomputers or a collection of in-house workstations. Several new algorithms for implementing such jobs in distributed computing environments are described.

This downloadable code is used to compute each jobs output for the management challenge of conserving the East African cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus). This case study shows that the proposed suite of statistical tools can be run on a supercomputer to establish the credibility of a managerially-relevant model of a political-ecological system that contains one or more endangered species. This demonstration means that the new standard of credibility that any political-ecological model needs to meet before being used to inform ecosystem management decisions, is the one given herein."

Among 2,248 students (mean age 13.6 years, 52% male), visual impairment was present in 699 (31%, 95% Confidence Interval 29-33%). Spectacle wear was observed in 360 of 966 children needing glasses (37%). Ownership of spectacles among children needing glasses was associated with poorer uncorrected vision in the better-seeing eye (P <0.001) and paternal educational (p=0.001), but not age, sex, boarding at school, both parents having out-migrated for work or maternal education. Spectacle ownership among children with visual impairment was associated with better test performance (P=0.035). Therefore, visual impairment and non-wear of spectacle were common. Wearing spectacles was associated with better academic performance in this cross-sectional analysis, consistent with recent trial results among younger children."

Publications remain essential for scientists, whereas general public relies on news articles. Numerous studies investigated the path from publications to news and identified press releases as the key factor, associating them with issues such as exaggerations, but less is known about the direct influence of press releases on subject choice or on the content of media reports. Here, a cross-sectional sample of publications related to genetics and CRISPR is assessed in three independent datasets (n = 1362 publications, n = 461 press releases). Analysis finds 92.5% (CI = 88.5-96.5) dependence of news outlets on press releases in terms of topic choice and 39-43% explicit use of passages from press releases. Publications without press releases are described by 74x fewer news outlets. Even if they come from leading journals or universities, lack of a press release leads to 8.8x less coverage. Given the high impact of press releases, their reliability is especially relevant, but the majority of them omits interest disclosures - 84.3% (CI = 80.8-87.7) of press releases did not mention existing conflicts of interest, including multiple patent applications. These results establish the major indirect and direct role of press releases in science communication via online media. In line with previous research, this dependency raises concerns about possible distortions of science coverage."

A Simulation-based study,"Reinagel, P.",Pamela  Reinagel,2019-12-16,scientific communication and education,"After an experiment has been completed, a trend may be observed that is ""not quite significant"". Sometimes in this situation, researchers collect more data in an effort to achieve statistical significance. Such ""N-hacking"" is condemned because it can lead to an excess of false positive results. I use simulations to demonstrate how N-hacking causes false positives. However, in a parameter regime relevant for many experiments, the increase in false positives is quite modest. Moreover, results obtained this way have higher Positive Predictive Value than non-incremented experiments of the same sample size and statistical power. In other words, adding a few more observations to shore up a nearly-significant result can increase the reproducibility of results, counter to some current rhetoric. Many experiments are non-confirmatory, and unplanned sample augmentation with reasonable decision rules would not cause rampant irreproducibility in that context."

Sixteen male national and international level swimmers (21.6 {+/-} 2.2 years) participated in the research. The competitors were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups before the data collection process: an experimental (EG, n = 8) and control (CG, n = 8) group. Both groups of swimmers carried out the same training program in the water environment (volume and intensity), while swimmers from EG additionally carried out the specific core muscle training. The task of the swimmers was an individual swim of 50 meters freestyle, during which the kinematic parameters of start, turn and swimming techniques were recorded using the video camera system. In both groups a minor increase in the flight phase was observed during the start (EG=0.06 m, 1.8%; p=0.088; CG = 0.08 m, 2.7%; p=0.013). The time of the distance 5 m after the turn and the recorded average speed of swimming this distance in EG statistically significant improved accordingly 0.1 s (-28.6%; p<0.001) and 3.56 m{middle dot}s-1 (23.2%; p=0.001). In EG, a statistically significant improvement in 50-m freestyle performance was observed by 0.3 s (-1.2%, p = 0.001).

H.; LEE, M.",MIJOON  LEE,2019-12-20,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundNew nurses need a certain period of time to adapt to the organization due to a lack of clinical competence, and also immaturity in social skill. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of new nurses clinical competence on career adaptation in order to use the results as basic information for developing education programs to improve their adaptability in clinical practice.

MethodThis study employed a descriptive survey to investigate the clinical competence and the career adaptability of new nurses working in a general hospital. The study subjects were 61 new nurses with less than one year of work experience and data was collected from June, 2018 to July, 2019. Data was analyzed using frequency analysis, descriptive statistics, t-test, ANOVA, Pearsons correlation coefficients, and multiple regression analysis.

ResultsOn average, the study subjects have worked for 11.33{+/-}1.51 months. In this study, the average clinical competence of new nurses was 2.21{+/-}0.61, and career adaptability was 3.00{+/-}0.39. The clinical competence of new nurses was positively correlated with career adaptability (r=.453, p<.001). Among the sub-categories of clinical competence, developing professional and legal implementation were found to affect career adaptability (t=2.24, p=.030).

ConclusionThe clinical competence of the new nurses was shown to positively affect their career adaptability, and it was confirmed that developing professional and legal implementation in the subcategories of clinical competence affected the career adaptability of the new nurses. Thus, it is necessary to establish a program that provides support for new nurses to enable them to build professional identities that they can be proud of."

W.; Mayr, P.",Philipp  Mayr,2019-12-23,scientific communication and education,"Citation metrics have value because they aim to make scientific assessment a level playing field, but urgent transparency-based adjustments are necessary to ensure that measurements yield the most accurate picture of impact and excellence. One problematic area is the handling of self-citations, which are either excluded or inappropriately accounted for when using bibliometric indicators for research evaluation. Here, in favor of openly tracking self-citations we report on self-referencing behavior among various academic disciplines as captured by the curated Clarivate Analytics Web of Science database. Specifically, we examined the behavior of 385,616 authors grouped into 15 subject areas like Biology, Chemistry, Science & Technology, Engineering, and Physics. These authors have published 3,240,973 papers that have accumulated 90,806,462 citations, roughly five percent of which are self-citations. Up until now, very little is known about the buildup of self-citations at the author-level and in field-specific contexts. Our view is that hiding self-citation data is indefensible and needlessly confuses any attempts to understand the bibliometric impact of ones work. Instead we urge academics to embrace visibility of citation data in a community of peers, which relies on nuance and openness rather than curated scorekeeping."

Stroud,2019-12-27,scientific communication and education,"Farmers are encouraged to embrace digital media to fill the voids caused by the privatisation of Agricultural Knowledge and Information Systems. Widespread sustainable agriculture misinformation undermines the role of science, participatory research, and evidence-based decision making. Simply providing information is insufficient, misinformation is tackled by creating a network that fosters accurate information exchange. Here I used Twitter and blended learning technologies to create a research partnership with farmers based on their beliefs that earthworms indicate good soils management. Through co-design, farmers transformed this symbol into a systematic field observation network, assessing earthworm populations to the ecological group level. Our community (#WorldWormWeek) revealed the falsehoods in misinformation such as: ""Farmers around the world have been turning their fields into subterranean deserts"". This social learning network was resilient to further misinformation by the national press. Real data trends were fundamentally different to predictions made by science advancing models of global earthworm populations. Anecic earthworms (including middens) were absent in 1 in 5 fields, directly informing management practices to avoid soil biological pitfalls in no-tillage adoption. Simplistic earthworm counts to indicate soil health are rendered obsolete, a depth of information exchange can be achieved by building science-farmer partnerships using digital communications and co-designed frameworks. However, the scientific consensus, whilst generally positive about the research impact, revealed 42 % scientists rated this research as ""not at all useful"" or ""slightly useful"" to scientists. This reveals the hopeless situation where the co-production of knowledge and feedback loop linking farming-science is not broadly considered  science advancing, and brought #Wormscience to an end. The next step would have been to optimize Lumbricus terrestris biocontrol actions targeting the soil-borne crop pathogen Fusarium spp. and detoxification of its mycotoxins, to reduce fungicide dependency in staple crop production; aligned with societal sustainable agriculture aspirations."

S.; Taubin, T.; Wilson, I. B.",M  Barton  Laws,2019-12-30,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundFindings on the association between health literacy and anti-retroviral (ARV) adherence are inconsistent. Health literacy is usually operationalized with simple tests of basic literacy, but more complex conceptions of health literacy include content knowledge. People living with chronic illness also conceptualize and experience illness in ways other than biomedical or mechanistic models of disease.

ObjectiveThere are no instruments that comprehensively assess knowledge of people living with HIV concerning HIV disease and treatment; or psychological adjustment to being HIV+. Little is known about the relationship between factual knowledge, or positive identification as HIV+, and anti-retroviral (ARV) adherence.

MethodsFormative work with in-depth semi-structured interviews, and cognitive testing, to develop a structured instrument assessing HIV-related knowledge, and personal meanings of living with HIV. Pilot administration of the instrument to a convenience sample of 101 respondents.

Key ResultsRespondents varied considerably in their expressed need for in-depth knowledge, the accuracy of their understanding of relevant scientific concepts and facts about ARV treatment, and psychological adjustment and acceptance of HIV+ status. Most knowledge domains were not significantly related to self-reported ARV adherence, but accurate knowledge specifically about ARV treatment was (r=0.25, p=.02), as was an adapted version of the Need for Cognition scale (r=.256, p=.012). Negative feelings about living with HIV (r=.33, p=.0012), and medication taking (r=.276, p=.008) were significantly associated with non-adherence.

ConclusionThe instrument may be useful in diagnosing addressable reasons for non-adherence, as a component of psychoeducational interventions, and for evaluation of such interventions.

PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARYWe developed a questionnaire for people with HIV. General knowledge about HIV wasnt related to whether people took their medications, but specific information about treatment was. People with lots of bad feelings about living with HIV were less likely to take medications as prescribed. People who liked to think more about their decisions were more likely to take their medications."

In this light, deciphering those factors able to hamper or facilitate an active lifestyle is crucial in order to increase patients adherence to physical activity. The purpose of this study was to explore barriers and motivations in a sample of female oncological patients, practising running using the ecological model and compare them with healthy controls. Focus group interviews were conducted at Verona University. Participants were 12 female cancer survivors and 7 matched healthy controls who had participated at ""Run for Science"" project. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using content analysis. Two main themes, motivations and barriers were found. About motivations, three sub-themes were identified: personal, interpersonal and environmental/organizational factors. Regarding barriers, another sub-theme was recognized: community/policy factors. Compare to healthy controls, survivors expressed motivations and barriers specifically related to their oncological disease. Running was a challenge with their cancer and a hope to give to other patients. Main barriers were represented by treatment-related side effects, inexperienced trainers and external factors, e.g. delivery of incorrect information. Running program dedicated to oncological patients should consider intrinsic obstacles, related to cancer and its treatment, offering a personalized intervention performed by qualified trainers, together with a motivational approach able to improve participants adherence to an active lifestyle."

However, little is known about what aspects of care patients would prioritize when presented with choices of desirable attributes and whether these patient priorities differ based on certain demographics.

ObjectiveTo assess patients priorities for a range of attributes in ambulatory care consultations across five key health service delivery domains and determine potential associations between patient priorities and certain demographic profiles.

MethodsUsing a What Matters to You survey patients ranked in order of importance various choices related to five health service domains (patient-physician relationship, personal responsibility, tests/procedures, medications and cost). Subjects were selected from two Johns Hopkins affiliated primary care clinics and a third gastroenterology subspecialty clinic over a period of 11 months. We calculated the percentage of respondents who selected each quality as their top 1-3 choice. Univariate and multivariate analyses determined demographic characteristics associated with patient priorities.

ResultsHumanistic qualities of physicians, leading a healthy lifestyle, shared decision making (SDM) for medications and tests/procedures and knowledge about insurance coverage were the most frequently ranked choices. Privately insured and more educated patients were less likely to rank humanistic qualities highly. Those with younger age, higher educational attainment and private insurance had higher odds of ranking healthy lifestyle as a top choice. Those with more education had higher odds of ranking SDM as a top choice.

ConclusionsIdentifying what matters most to patients is useful as we move towards patient-centered and value based care models. Our findings suggest that patients have priorities on qualities they value across key health service domains. Multiple factors including patient demographics can be predictors of these priorities. Elucidating these preferences is a challenging but a valuable step in the right direction."

MethodsWe screened 73 WLWH presenting for perinatal care in Lilongwe, Malawi using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). We conducted interviews with 24 women experiencing PND and analyzed data using inductive and deductive coding and narrative analysis.

ResultsWomen experienced a double burden of physical and mental illness, expressed as pain in ones heart. Receiving an HIV diagnosis unexpectedly during antenatal care was a key contributor to developing PND. This development was influenced by stigmatization and social support.

ConclusionsThese findings highlight the need to recognize the mental health implications of routine screening for HIV and to routinely screen and treat PND among WLWH. Culturally appropriate mental health interventions are needed in settings with a high HIV burden."

In order to inform future developments, it is important to understand the benefits and impact of prescribing by allied health professionals including physiotherapists and podiatrists.

Aim: to compare outcomes of Physiotherapist and Podiatrist Independent Prescriber (PP-IP) patients with those of Physiotherapist and Podiatrist non-prescribers (PP-NPs). Outcome measures included patient satisfaction, ease of access to services, quality of life and cost implications.

Design: a quasi-experimental, post-test control group design

Methods: Using mixed methods outcomes were compared between 7 sites where care was provided from a PP-IP (3 podiatrist and 4 physiotherapist IPs) and 7 sites from a PP-NP (3 podiatrist and 4 physiotherapist NPs). Patients were followed up for 2 months (2015-2016).

Results: 489 patients were recruited: n=243 IP sites, and n=246 NP sites. Independent prescribing was found to be highly acceptable, and equivalent in terms of quality of life (p>0.05) and patient satisfaction (p[&le;]0.05) compared to care provided by NPs. PP-IP care delivery was found to be more resource intensive than NP-PP, with longer consultation duration for IPs (around 6.5 mins), and a higher proportion of physiotherapy patients discussed with medical colleagues (around 9.5 minutes).

ConclusionThis study provides new knowledge that PP-IPs provide high levels of care. PP-IP care delivery was found to be more resource intensive. Further research is required to explore cost effectiveness. A more focussed exploration within each profession using targeted outcome measures would enable a more robust comparison, inform future developments around the world and help ensure non-doctor prescribing is recognised as an effective way to alleviate shortfalls in the global workforce."

S.",Danielle S Bassett,2020-01-11,scientific communication and education,"Like many scientific disciplines, neuroscience has increasingly attempted to confront pervasive gender imbalances within the field. While much of the conversation has centered around publishing and conference participation, recent research in other fields has called attention to the prevalence of gender bias in citation practices. Because of the downstream effects that citations can have on visibility and career advancement, understanding and eliminating gender bias in citation practices is vital for addressing inequity in a scientific community. In this study, we sought to determine whether there is evidence of gender bias in the citation practices of neuroscientists. Using data from five top neuroscience journals, we find that reference lists tend to include more papers with men as first and last author than would be expected if gender were not a factor in referencing. Importantly, we show that this overcitation of men and undercitation of women is driven largely by the citation practices of men, and is increasing over time as the field becomes more diverse. We develop a co-authorship network to assess homophily in researchers’ social networks, and we find that men tend to overcite men even when their social networks are representative. We discuss possible mechanisms and consider how individual researchers might address these findings in their own practices.View Full Text"

The study had a cross-sectional correlational design. Convenience sampling was applied to recruit 320 nurses with multiple roles from 8 nursing universities and 3 hospitals in China between January and August 2017. SPSS (version 20.0) software and PROCESS program was used to examine to moderating effect of social support between the relationship of role conflicts and job satisfaction. It was found that role conflicts were negatively correlated with job satisfaction. Support from work and support from family negatively moderated the relationship between role conflicts and job satisfaction. These findings suggest that support from family, coworkers and nursing administrators, and the implementation of school- and family-friendly policies would help nurses who are pursuing further nursing degrees to handle their multiple roles and improve their job satisfaction."

C.",Rehana K Leak,2020-01-16,scientific communication and education,"Introduction Poor sleep hygiene portends loss of physical and mental stamina. Therefore, maintaining a regular sleep/wake schedule on both weekdays and weekends is highly recommended. However, this advice runs contrary to the habits of university students, who may only experience recovery sleep if they sleep late on weekends. Pharmacy students at Duquesne University sit for frequent examinations, typically commencing at 7:30 AM, and they complain about fatigue. Here, we tested the central hypothesis that longer sleep durations on weekdays and weekends are linked to stronger academic performance in Pharmacy students.Methods Students in their first professional year were administered three surveys to collect data on sleep habits and factors that might influence sleep, such as roommates, long commute times, and sleep interruptions. GPAs were collected from the Dean’s office, with permission from the students.Results Longer weekend—but not weekday—sleep durations were significantly correlated with higher cumulative GPAs in men and not in women. Women achieved slightly higher cumulative GPAs than men. Students who fell asleep within 15 minutes of going to bed had higher professional-phase GPAs than those who fell asleep after an hour or more.Conclusion Our observations cannot establish causal links, but, given the body of prior evidence on the salutary properties of sleep, men in this cohort may reap benefit from recovery sleep on weekends. Rather than recommending that students force themselves awake early on weekends in an attempt to maintain a consistent sleep routine, the real-life habits of students should be given consideration.View Full Text"

Here, we have elaborated the Vision and Change core competency framework into a resource called the BioSkills Guide, a set of measurable learning outcomes that can be more readily interpreted and implemented by faculty. College biology educators representing over 250 institutions, including 73 community colleges, contributed to the development and validation of the guide. Our grassroots approach during the development phase engaged over 200 educators over the course of five iterative rounds of review and revision. We then gathered evidence of the BioSkills Guides content validity using a national survey of over 400 educators. Across the 77 outcomes in the final draft, rates of respondent support for outcomes were high (74.3% - 99.6%). Our national sample included college biology educators across a range of course levels, subdisciplines of biology, and institution types. We envision the BioSkills Guide supporting a variety of applications in undergraduate biology, including backward design of individual lessons and courses, competency assessment development, curriculum mapping and planning, and resource development for less well-defined competencies."

Fortunately, some of the root causes are known and can be addressed by scientists and authors alike. After careful consideration of the available literature, the National Institutes of Health identified several key problems with the way that scientists conduct and report their research and introduced guidelines to improve the rigor and reproducibility of pre-clinical studies. Many journals have implemented policies addressing these same criteria. We currently have, however, no comprehensive data on how these guidelines are impacting the reporting of research. Using SciScore, an automated tool developed to review the methods sections of manuscripts for the presence of criteria associated with the NIH and other reporting guidelines, e.g., ARRIVE, RRIDs, we have analyzed ~1.6 million PubMed Central papers to determine the degree to which articles were addressing these criteria. The tool scores each paper on a ten point scale identifying sentences that are associated with compliance with criteria associated with increased rigor (5 pts) and those associated with key resource identification and authentication (5 pts).

Our analyses show that the average score over all journals has increased since 1997, but remains below five, indicating that less than half of the rigor and reproducibility criteria are routinely addressed by authors. To analyze the data further, we examined the prevalence of individual criteria across the literature, e.g., the reporting of a subject’s sex (21-37% of studies between 1997 and 2019), the inclusion of sample size calculations (2-10%), whether the study addressed blinding (3-9%), or the identifiability of key biological resources such as antibodies (11-43%), transgenic organisms (14-22%), and cell lines (33-39%). The greatest increase in prevalence for rigor criteria was seen in the use of randomization of subjects (10-30%), while software tool identifiability improved the most among key resource types (42-87%). We further analyzed individual journals over time that had implemented specific author guidelines covering rigor criteria, and found that in some journals, they had a big impact, whereas in others they did not. We speculate that unless they are enforced, author guidelines alone do little to improve the number of criteria addressed by authors. Our Rigor and Transparency Index did not correlate with the impact factors of journals.View Full Text"

V.",Melissa Virginia Ramirez,2020-01-20,scientific communication and education,"Undergraduate biology courses rely heavily on visual representation of information. Students view images of plants, animals, and microbes, interpret data presented in graphs, and use drawings to understand how cells and molecules interact in three dimensions. Traditional teaching approaches exclude students with visual impairments and disadvantage students with disabilities that affect their interpretation and processing of visual and spatial information as well as students who simply do not identify as ""visual learners"". By using new technologies to develop tactile teaching tools (TTTs) that can be employed in classrooms, we aim to create inclusive learning environments and more effectively instruct diverse learners. The advent of affordable and accessible 3D printing technology makes it possible to create tactile models that represent molecules, cells, and entire organisms more accurately than traditional visual representations. We describe the assessment of a 3D gene expression puzzle as a guided inquiry learning activity in which students must correctly assemble a series of components in order to achieve an output. Upon completion of the puzzle, the TTT provides tactile feedback through vibration to signal transcriptional activation. Analysis of pre- and post-assessment performance demonstrated statistically significant increases in individual students paired assessment scores in two different classroom implementations, with a greater effect size at a rural minority-serving institution than an urban R1 university. These encouraging preliminary data suggest that TTTs with guided-inquiry learning disproportionately benefit disadvantaged student populations and could serve as a tool in leveling the playing field when teaching abstract biological concepts in diverse educational settings."

Unmatched Case-Control Study","Alayu, M.; Teshome, T.; Amare, H.; Kinde, S.; Belay, D.; Assefa, Z.",Mikias  Alayu,2020-01-21,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundChikungunya Virus is a Ribose Nucleic Acid (RNA) virus transmitted by a mosquito bite. Aedes Aegypti and Aedes Albopictus are responsible vectors for Chikungunya Virus transmission. CHIKV outbreaks are characterized by rapid spread and infection rates as high as 75%. A combination of health system efforts and healthy behavior practices by the community is essential for effective control.

MethodsUnmatched case control study was done to identify risk factors of this outbreak. One case to two controls ratios was calculated. All cases during the study period (74 cases) and 148 controls were included in the study. Bivariate and multivariable analysis were implemented. Serum samples were tested by Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction at Ethiopian Public Health Institute laboratory.

ResultsA total of 74 chikungunya fever cases were reported starting from 19th May 2019 to 8th June 2019. Not using bed net at day time sleeping (P- value < 0.001, AOR 20.8, 95CI 6.4 - 66.7), presence of open water holding container (P- value 0.023, AOR 4, 95CI 1.2 - 13.5), presence of larvae in water holding container (P- value 0.015, AOR 4.8, 95CI 1.4 - 16.8), ill person with similar sign and symptoms in the family or neighbors (P- value <0.001, AOR 27.9, 95CI 6.5 - 120.4) and wearing not full body cover clothes (P- value 0.002, AOR 8.1, 95CI 2.2 - 30.1) were significant risk factors.

ConclusionUsing bed nets at day time sleeping, cover the water holding containers, wearing full body cover cloths are protective factors."

Y.; Cheung, P.-Y.; Lee, T.-F.; O'Reilly, M.; Schmölzer, G. M.",Georg  M.  Schmölzer,2020-01-23,scientific communication and education,"ObjectiveSustained inflation (SI) during chest compression (CC = CC+SI) significantly reduces time to return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) compared to 3:1 compression-to-ventilation ratio during neonatal resuscitation. However, the optimal peak inflation pressure (PIP) of SI during CC+SI to improve ROSC and hemodynamic recovery in severely asphyxiated piglets is unknown.

AimTo examine if different PIPs of SI during CC+SI will improve ROSC and hemodynamic recovery in severely asphyxiated piglets.

Intervention and measurementsTwenty-nine newborn piglets (1-3 days old) were anesthetized, intubated, instrumented and exposed to 30-min normocapnic hypoxia followed by asphyxia. Piglets were randomized into four groups: CC+SI with a PIP of 10 cmH2O (CC+SI_PIP_10, n=8), a PIP of 20 cmH2O (CC+SI_PIP_20, n=8), a PIP of 30 cmH2O (CC+SI_PIP_30, n=8), and a sham-operated control group (n=5). Heart rate, arterial blood pressure, carotid blood flow, cerebral oxygenation, and respiratory parameters were continuously recorded throughout the experiment.

Main resultsBaseline parameters were similar between all groups. There was no difference in asphyxiation (duration and degree) between intervention groups. PIP correlated positively with tidal volume and inversely with exhaled CO2 during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Time to ROSC and rate of ROSC were similar between piglets resuscitated with CC+SI_PIP_10, CC+SI_PIP_20, and CC+SI_PIP_30 cmH2O: median (IQR) 75 (63-193) sec, 94 (78-210) sec, and 85 (70-90) sec; 5/8 (63%), 7/8 (88%), and 3/8 (38%) (p=0.56 and p=0.12, respectively). All piglets that achieved ROSC survived to four hours post-resuscitation. Piglets resuscitated with CC+SI_PIP_30 cmH2O exhibited increased concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1{beta} and tumour necrosis factor- in the frontoparietal cerebral cortex (both p<0.05 vs. sham-operated controls).

ConclusionsIn asphyxiated term newborn piglets resuscitated by CC+SI, the use of different PIPs resulted in similar time to ROSC, but PIP at 30 cmH2O showed a larger VT delivery, lower exhaled CO2 and increased tissue inflammatory markers in the brain."
10.1101/2020.01.24.917864,A systematic review of scientific research focused on farmers in agricultural adaptation to climate change (2008-2017),"Yang, Y.; Seyler, B. C.; Feng, M.; Tang, Y.",Yao  Yang,2020-01-24,scientific communication and education,"Due to the severe consequences of climate change, associated risks to global food security, and the contribution of agriculture to greenhouse gas emissions, agriculture must necessarily adapt to meet these challenges. Many studies have therefore sought to investigate agricultural adaptation to climate change, and as key stakeholders in agriculture, farmers play a vital role in this process. There is a rapidly increasing corpus of scholarship on agricultural adaptation to climate change, with many studies beginning to incorporate survey methods to examine farmer perceptions and adaptation responses. Nevertheless, in-depth understanding of farmers worldwide is inadequate due to insufficiently robust methodologies, socio-economic disparities, and unequal geographic distribution. In this study, we searched and reviewed the existing peer-reviewed, English-language scientific articles published between 2008 and 2017 on agricultural adaptation to climate change that have incorporated farmers into their research methodologies. The main findings include the following: (1) a small but increasing number of studies focus on farmers in climate change adaptation; (2) the global geographic distribution of the reviewed studies is uneven, and many of the most vulnerable nations (e.g., lower-income/agricultural-dependent economies) have no representation at all; (3) there were diverse rationales and methods for incorporating farmers into the studies, and many of the methodological differences were due to practical and logistical limitations in lower-income/agricultural-dependent nations; and (4) studies were from multiple academic fields, indicating the need for more interdisciplinary collaboration moving forward because agricultural adaptation to climate change is too complex for a single discipline to fully explore. Although English is increasingly recognized as the ""international language of science,"" due to the challenge of language segmentation limiting broader understanding of global scholarship whenever possible, future reviews should be jointly conducted in both English and non-English languages."

Choudhury,2020-01-27,scientific communication and education,"California spinach growers struggle to manage spinach downy mildew disease. The disease is especially difficult in the organic crop, which currently relies on resistant varieties to maintain disease-free crop. Alternative control measures are available, but it is not clear how growers perceive the efficacy of these methods. It is also not clear who growers contact to find out information on spinach downy mildew disease management. In this study, we conducted an online survey of people involved in spinach production, asking about their beliefs in the efficacy of different control methods and who they contact frequently to discuss spinach downy mildew control. We found that respondents were most positive about the efficacy of resistant varieties and synthetic pesticides, with much lower perceived efficacy for the practices of disking diseased fields, roguing diseased plants, and organic pesticides. Growers most frequently contacted pest control advisors (PCAs) about management strategies for spinach downy mildew. These results suggest that respondents are most confident about the efficacy of resistant varieties and synthetic pesticides and may be hesitant to adopt new control strategies like organic pesticides. The results also suggest that future extension efforts can be focused on PCAs to reach the most stakeholders with up to date research on downy mildew control."

C.",Jan  Łukasik,2020-01-27,scientific communication and education,"IntroductionRoutine use of probiotics during antibiotic therapy in children remains a subject of discussion. To facilitate synthesis of individual study results and guideline formulation, it is important to assess predefined, similar, and clinically important outcomes. Core outcome sets are a proposed solution for this issue. Aim of this review was to document choice, design, and heterogeneity of outcomes in studies that assessed the effects of probiotics used for the prevention of antibiotic-associated adverse events in children.

MethodsA systematic literature search covering three major databases was performed. Trials that evaluated oral probiotics use concomitant with antibiotic therapy in children were included. Data on outcome definitions, measurement instruments, and follow-up were extracted. The outcomes were assigned to predefined core areas and domains. Data were analyzed descriptively.

ResultsThirty-six trials were included in this review. Diarrhea, the most commonly reported outcome, had diagnostic criteria clearly defined only in 20 trials. In total, sixteen different definitions of diarrhea were identified. Diarrhea duration, severity and etiology were reported in 8, 4 and 6 studies, respectively. Nineteen studies assessed gastrointestinal symptoms other than diarrhea. Seven studies reported outcomes related to resource use or the economic impact of the intervention. Only 2 studies assessed outcomes related to life impact. None of the studies predefined adverse events of probiotic use.

ConclusionsIdentified outcomes were characterized by substantial heterogeneity. Majority of outcomes were not designed to evaluate endpoints of real-life relevance. Results from this review suggest the need for a new core outcome set consisting of outcomes important for decision-making."

We examine LARC information provided by Student Health Centers (SHC) websites from Universities across the USA to document disparities in access to information on these important contraception methods for college students. We find that compared to EC, Condoms, (plus Pap smear as control), LARC is mentioned less frequently than the others and 73% of schools have no LARC content on their SHC websites. There is no standardization in how the sexual and reproductive health information is organized on SHC websites, which might hinder access. When LARC information does exist, readability and accessibility vary. Universities having high rates of the student body who are African American or female are less likely to provide LARC information on their SHC website and universities situated in more rural settings are less likely to post LARC information on their websites."

Solidarity with Animals, Animal Welfare and Meat Consumption","Boaitey, A.; Jette Nantel, S.; Eden, M.",Albert  Boaitey,2020-01-30,scientific communication and education,"Meat consumption is influenced by a variety of factors including of empathy and feelings on affinity towards farm animals. The goal of this study was to examine the role of solidarity with animals on meat consumption and attitudes towards the treatment of animals. Data was drawn from a sample of 265 respondents in the US. Correlation and mediation analyses were performed. The results of the correlation analysis indicate a moderate but positive correlation between solidarity with animals and proecological beliefs. The association between attitudes towards the treatment of farm animals and antibiotic use and solidarity with animals was also positive. Relative to meat consumption, the results indicate that proecological beliefs and concerns about the treatment of farm animals negatively influenced consumption. The effect of attitudes towards antibiotic use and solidarity with animals on consumption were however fully mediated by proecological beliefs. The results indicate that social identification with animals can play a significant role in food choice. However, its relationship with proecological beliefs implies that holistic approaches are required to address current livestock production practices that are considered unnatural."

J.; Keegan, L.; Fulford, D.",Simone  V  Gill,2020-01-31,scientific communication and education,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between effort-based decision making and gross motor performance. Effort-based decision making was measured using a modified version of the Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task in which participants pressed a button on a keyboard to fill a bar on a screen for a monetary reward. Gross motor performance was measured with a walking task in which participants matched their steps to the beat of an audio metronome. We hypothesized that increased effort during the effort-based decision making task would be paired with an increase in steps taken per minute during the gross motor task. However, the results of this study indicated no relationship between the effort-based decision making task and the gross motor task. Planning rather than decision-making may have been the cognitive construct that governed our gross motor task. These findings can be beneficial when thinking about potential interventions for populations who experience deficits in motor performance and cognition as well as for understanding the relationship between both cognitive and motor performance in healthy adults."

This multi-study research aimed to develop and validate a questionnaire suitable for investigating the effect of scientist-facilitated science outreach on the science self-efficacy of children aged 11-12 years old. In Study 1 the first version of the Irish Science Self-Efficacy Childrens Questionnaire (IS-SEC-Q) was developed and tested with 92 primary school students. In Study 2, the revised questionnaire was re-tested with 282 students. For both studies, construct validity was examined through factor analysis. Questionnaire interpretation and comprehension were investigated via interviews (N=4 and 25 respectively). In Study 2, convergent and criterion validity of the scales was also examined. The final IS-SEC-Q contained 5 scales (63 items), including an adaptation of Usher and Pajares  Sources of Self-Efficacy in Mathematics scale. Study 2 interviews indicated possible misinterpretations of the Emotional State subscale. The questionnaire demonstrated good psychometric properties and should serve well for informal science education practitioners endeavouring to assess their impact on primary childrens science self-efficacy."

Specifically, we investigated the association between a papers posting time to bioR{chi}iv, a preprints server, and journal articles peer-review and acceptance time for PLOS ONE. So far, of the total papers published in 1,626 academic journals, the average publication rate of those posted in bioR{chi}iv is 40.67%. Meanwhile, PLOS ONE was the journal that published more papers. Analysis of peer-review and acceptance time of papers published in journals via preprints showed the time these papers are posted in relation to these intervals. The median of the peer-review and acceptance time of the journal submission date that was later than the date of first posting to bioR{chi}iv was 110.00 days, and in the reverse case, it was 139.50 days. Posting to the preprint server before journal submission shows a better order than vice versa. This study provides us a good understanding of the peer-review process. It also gives us good insights into optimizing this process, which would then facilitate paper publication and knowledge dissemination."

M.; Schussler, E. E.",Miranda  M.  Chen Musgrove,2020-02-07,scientific communication and education,"Anxiety among graduate students in the United States has increased over the last several decades, affecting not only their overall mental health but also reducing retention in graduate programs. Teachers with high teaching anxiety can negatively impact student learning, yet the impacts of teaching anxiety on graduate teaching assistants (GTAs) is not well studied. Biology GTAs teach most introductory Biology labs and discussions nationally, thus broadly influencing the quality of undergraduate education. In Fall 2016, we investigated Biology GTA teaching anxiety at a large research-intensive southeastern university by (1) measuring teaching anxiety of Biology GTAs, and (2) exploring the relationships among teaching anxiety, self-efficacy, and coping. Using multiple linear regressions, we found that greater teaching self-efficacy is related to lower teaching anxiety in Biology GTAs (R2adi =0.65, p<0.001). Coping strategies and frequencies did not significantly contribute to teaching anxiety in our models. We found similar levels of teaching anxiety across genders, ethnicities, student citizenship status (domestic vs. international) and teaching experience level. However, there were significant differences among student subgroups in teaching self-efficacy and coping strategies. Effective coping may contribute to the lack of anxiety differences among some of the student subgroups. These results can inform teaching professional development for GTAs, and encourage greater awareness and dialogue about the impacts of mental health issues in academia."

A small scale solution was developed in the form of a unique post-graduate diploma program that imparted reliable skills in students with good theoretical knowledge. The course of 6 to 8 months duration, with an optional 6 months internship, was successfully conducted for 8 batches. Most students of this course inculcated the right laboratory practices. This was evident by safe operations, and precise as well as accurate results of quantitative experiments conducted by them. They learned to work independently as well as in teams. They could create and follow standard operating procedures, and contribute to general laboratory maintenance. Every student also designed, prepared and conducted routine molecular biology experiments. The following aspects are suggested for successfully dealing with the patchy and varied capacities of life science students during higher (post bachelors) studies: a) careful selection of students, b) training with prioritized objectives, c) attention to basic lab-practices, d) opportunities to self-learn, e) structured group discussions, f) teacher(s) with genuine interest and passion, g) reasonable infrastructure, and h) maintaining a good student-instructor ratio.

Effective communication with patients is one of the most important factors in caring behaviors of nurses working in ICUs. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of therapeutic communication skills training on the caring behaviors of ICU nurese.

Materials and MethodsThis experimental pre-test/post-test study was carried out on 105 nurses working in ICUs of hospitals affiliated to Yazd University of Medical Sciences in Iran in 2019. Nurses were randomly assigned into control (52 nurses) and intervention (53 nurses) groups. A two-day therapeutic communication training workshop was conducted for the participants. Data were collected using demographic information questionnaire and caring behaviors questionnaire before and one month after the intervention.

ResultsThe findings showed no significant difference between the control and intervention groups regarding the nurses caring behaviors in the pretest (P = 0.148). However, after implementation of the training program, a significant difference was observed in the mean scores of caring behaviors between the two groups. In the control group, the mean scores of caring behaviors decreased significantly after the intervention (P = 0.001); whereas, the mean scores of intervention group increased significantly after the intervention (P = 0.001).

ConclusionAccording to the results, ICU nurses training in therapeutic communication skills had a positive effect on their caring behaviors. Therefore, we suggest the authorities prepare and implement educational packages of therapeutic communication skills as a coherent program for other nurses. As a result, the caring behaviors and the quality of cares can be improved for patients."

But success in science is difficult to define, let alone to translate in indicators that can be used for assessment. In the past few years, several groups expressed their dissatisfaction with the indicators currently used for assessing researchers. But given the lack of agreement on what should constitute success in science, most propositions remain unanswered. This paper aims to complement our understanding of success in science and to document areas of tension and conflict in research assessments.

MethodsWe conducted semi-structured interviews and focus groups with policy makers, funders, institution leaders, editors or publishers, research integrity office members, research integrity community members, laboratory technicians, researchers, research students, and former-researchers who changed career to inquire on the topics of success, integrity, and responsibilities in science. We used the Flemish biomedical landscape as a baseline to be able to grasp the views of interacting and complementary actors in a system setting.

ResultsGiven the breadth of our results, we divided our findings in a two-paper series, with the current paper focusing on what defines and determines success in science. Respondents depicted success as a multi-factorial, context-dependent, and mutable factor. Success appeared to be an interaction between characteristics from the researcher (Who), research outputs (What), processes (How), and luck. Interviewees noted that current research assessments overvalued outputs but largely ignored the processes deemed essential for research quality and integrity. Interviewees sustained that we need a diversity of indicators to allow a balanced and diverse view of success; that assessments should not blindly depend on metrics but also value human input; that we must value quality over quantity; and that any indicators used must be transparent, robust, and valid.

ConclusionsThe objective of research assessments may be to encourage good researchers, to benefit society, or simply to advance science. Yet we show that current assessments fall short on each of these objectives. Open and transparent inter-actor dialogue is needed to understand what research assessments aim for and how they can best achieve their objective.

But despite the rich body of research available, few empirical works provide the perspectives of non-researcher stakeholders.

MethodsTo capture some of the forgotten voices, we conducted semi-structured interviews and focus groups with policy makers, funders, institution leaders, editors or publishers, research integrity office members, research integrity community members, laboratory technicians, researchers, research students, and former-researchers who changed career to inquire on the topics of success, integrity, and responsibilities in science. We used the Flemish biomedical landscape as a baseline to be able to grasp the views of interacting and complementary actors in a system setting.

ResultsGiven the breadth of our results, we divided our findings in a two-paper series with the current paper focusing on the problems that affect the quality and integrity of science. We first discovered that perspectives on misconduct, including the core reasons for condemning misconduct, differed between individuals and actor groups. Beyond misconduct, interviewees also identified numerous problems which affect the integrity of research. Issues related to personalities and attitudes, lack of knowledge of good practices, and research climate were mentioned. Elements that were described as essential for success (in the associate paper) were often thought to accentuate the problems of research climates by disrupting research cultures and research environments. Even though everyone agreed that current research climates need to be addressed, no one felt responsible nor capable of initiating change. Instead, respondents revealed a circle of blame and mistrust between actor groups.

ConclusionsOur findings resonate with recent debates, and extrapolate a few action points which might help advance the discussion. First, we must tackle how research is assessed. Second, approaches to promote better science should be revisited: not only should they directly address the impact of climates on research practices, but they should also redefine their objective to empower and support researchers rather than to capitalize on their compliance.

Because most major scientific journals are published in English, success is related to publishing in this language. Currently, 98% of publications in science are written in English, including researchers from English as a Foreign Language (EFL) countries. Colombia is among the countries with the lowest English proficiency in the world. Thus, understanding the disadvantages that Colombians face in publishing is crucial to reducing global inequality in science. This paper quantifies the disadvantages that result from the language hegemony in scientific publishing by examining the additional costs that communicating in English creates in the production of articles. It was identified that more than 90% of the scientific articles published by Colombian researchers are in English, and that publishing in a second language creates additional financial costs to Colombian doctoral students and results in problems with reading comprehension, writing ease and time, and anxiety. Rejection or revision of their articles because of the English grammar was reported by 43.5% of the doctoral students, and 33% elected not to attend international conferences and meetings due to the mandatory use of English in oral presentations. Finally, among the translation/editing services reviewed, the cost per article is between one-quarter and one-half of a doctoral monthly salary in Colombia. Of particular note, we identified a positive correlation between English proficiency and higher socioeconomic origin of the researcher. Overall, this study exhibits the negative consequences of hegemony of English that preserves the global gap in science. Although having a common language is important for science communication, generating multilinguistic alternatives would promote diversity while conserving a communication channel. Such an effort should come from different actors and should not fall solely on EFL researchers."

J.; Farokhi, A.; Ghorbanlou, M.; Arianmanesh, M.",Mitra  Arianmanesh,2020-02-19,scientific communication and education,"IntroductionEmbryology is a branch of medical sciences in developmental biology. Since the knowledge of embryology is of special significance for medical students, this study was conducted with the purpose of elucidating the viewpoint of medical students of Zanjan University of Medical Sciences in Iran on the application of embryology courses in fulfilling clinical purposes.

MethodsThis cross-sectional study was conducted in 2018-2019 with a census method on all clinical medical students (trainees and interns). To collect medical students opinions, the researcher-designed questionnaire was used. The validity of the questionnaire was confirmed by embryology experts by content validity ratio (CVR) and factor analysis and the reliability of the questionnaire Cronbachs alpha coefficient (0.9), respectively. Data were analyzed by SPSS (version 24) and Lisrel software. Values with P<0.05 were considered significant.

ResultsDescriptive statistics in the field of general and system-based embryology demonstrated that the topics of birth defects and development of body cavities (diaphragm development) have the most influence on clinical practice of medical students.

ConclusionsIt seems that more focus on system-based embryology courses leads to a better performance of medical students in clinical courses."

L.; Helikar, T.",Toméš  Helikar,2020-02-19,scientific communication and education,"Understanding metabolic function requires knowledge of the dynamics, interdependence, and regulation of biochemical networks. However, current approaches are not optimal to develop the needed mechanistic understanding, and misconceptions about biological processes persist even after graduation. To address these issues, we developed a computational modeling and simulation approach that employs scaffolded learning to teach biochemistry students about the regulation of metabolism. The power of the approach lies in students abilities to alter any component or connection in a modeled system and instantly observe the effects of their changes. We find that students who use our approach perform better on biochemistry metabolism questions compared to students in a course that did not use this approach. We also investigated performance by gender and found that our modules may have the potential to increase equity in education. We noted that students are generally positive about the approach and appreciate its benefits. Our modules provide life science instructors with a dynamic and systems-driven approach to teach metabolic regulation and control that improves learning and also equips students with important technical skills."

M.; Truant, R.",Ray  Truant,2020-02-20,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundDissemination of accurate health research information to patients and families has become increasingly important with the rise of the internet as a means of finding health information. However, the public faces several barriers to accessing research information; including paywalls and technical jargon. One method to bridge this gap between patients, families, and research is using lay summaries. SCAsource is an online knowledge translation platform where peer-reviewed research papers on ataxia are translated into lay summaries. This online platform was launched in September 2018, with the goal of making ataxia research more accessible and understandable to patients and families. A secondary goal is to provide opportunities for ataxia researchers to develop and hone their knowledge translation skills, altogether improving the quality of patient communication in the ataxia community.

AimThe aim of this study was to measure the impact of SCAsource on its readers and volunteer contributors after one year of activity. This is to ensure SCAsource is meeting its goals of (1) improving access and understanding of ataxia research to lay audiences, and (2) improving knowledge translation skills of volunteer contributors.

MethodsTwo online surveys were launched, one for readers and one for volunteers. Each survey had a combination of multiple-choice, Likert-scale type, and open-ended short-answer questions. Descriptive quantitative analysis was used for respondent characteristics and Likert-type data. A grounded theory coding approach was used to analyze narrative feedback data.

ResultsWe found that SCAsource has mutually beneficial outcomes for both lay person readers and volunteer contributors. Readers have an increased understanding of ataxia research and access to up-to-date information on recent publications. Volunteers develop knowledge translation skills and have increased confidence in communicating results to lay audiences. Areas of improvement were identified to be incorporated into the platform.

ConclusionWe demonstrated that SCAsource improves access to information and understanding of research to lay audiences, while providing opportunities for researchers to develop knowledge translation skills. This framework can potentially be used by other rare disease organizations to launch and evaluate their own knowledge translation websites."

S.; Dolby, K.; Samarisinghe, B.",Ian S Viney,2020-02-20,scientific communication and education,"This study examined the progress of MRC-funded researchers, with a focus on their success in securing subsequent research income. We report here results from compiling details of the research income of researchers that completed an MRC early career award between 2011 and 2015. Depending on the funding scheme 50-59 per cent of researchers spent on average more than 100,000 GBP per year from new grants secured within three years of finishing their MRC award. In each scheme around 30 per cent of researchers secured less than 50,000 GBP per year research funding in the three years following their MRC award. We apply the same approach to an analysis of progression for the MRC cadre of intramurally-supported Programme Leader Track researchers, and a sample of MRC research grant holders. We also supplement our results with a small number of interviews with researchers that held MRC New Investigator Research Grants. We suggest that these data confirm reasonably good progression rates, with MRC early career schemes demonstrably effective in supporting research careers. They confirm there is a bottleneck with some researchers taking several years to establish their research career, and that expansion of the research base will need balanced new investment across schemes and stages and cannot be driven through growth in early career schemes alone."

Decisions were primarily motivated by job insecurity (52%), while grievances included poor supervision (60%), bullying or harassment (34%), inequitable hiring practices (39%) and poor support for families (9.6%). A concerning rate of ""questionable research practices"" by colleagues (34.1% to 41.1%) was reported to have impacted ECR career advancement. Our study links recent reports that characterise the health of the research industry, providing direct insight from ECRs on job insecurity, workplace culture challenges, and the logical rise of questionable research practices.

Here we propose the following guidelines for cultivating a successful women-in-STEM-focused group based upon survey results from our own scientific community as well as the experience of our WiSE group leaders. We hope these recommendations can provide guidance to advocacy groups at other research and academic organizations that wish to strengthen their efforts. While our own group specifically focuses on the underrepresented state of women in science, we hope these guidelines may be adapted and applied to groups that advocate for any minority group within the greater scientific community (i.e. those of gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic background, sexual orientation, etc.)."

F.",Adam PA Cardilini,2020-02-23,scientific communication and education,"The relationship between a PhD candidate and their supervisor is influential in not only successful candidate completion, but maintaining candidate satisfaction and mental health. We quantified potential mismatches between the PhD candidates and supervisors expectations as a potential mechanism that facilitates poor candidate experiences and research training outcomes. 114 PhD candidates and 52 supervisors ranked the importance of student attributes and outcomes at the beginning and end of candidature. In relation to specific attributes, supervisors indicated the level of guidance they expected to give the candidate and candidates indicated the level of guidance they expected to receive. Candidates also report on whether different aspects of candidature influenced their mental well-being. We identified differences between candidates and supervisors perceived supervisor teaching responsibility and influences on mental well-being. Our results indicate that the majority of candidates were satisfied overall with their supervision, and find alignment of many expectations between both parties. Yet, we find that candidates have much higher expectations of achieving quantitative outcomes than supervisors. Supervisors believed they give more guidance to candidates than candidates perceive they received, and supervisors often only provided guidance when the candidate explicitly asked. Personal expectations and research progress significantly and negatively influenced over 50% of candidates mental well-being. Our results highlight the importance of candidates and supervisors explicitly communicating the responsibilities and expectations of the roles they play in helping candidates develop research skills. We provide four suggestions to supervisors that may be particularly effective at increasing communication, avoiding potential conflict and promoting candidate success and wellbeing."

Microbiology students generally conduct bacterial characterization experiments in their coursework; however they are frequently restricted to model organisms without ecological relevance and for which the results have been known for decades. We present a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) curriculum to involve students in characterization of previously untested, ecologically relevant bacterioplankton cultures to identify the carbon substrates used for growth, as well as the temperature and salinity ranges conducive to growth. Students use these results to connect their organisms physiology to the isolation environment. This curriculum also exposes students to advanced microbiology methods such as flow cytometry for measuring cell concentrations, teaches them to use the programming language R for data plotting, and emphasizes scientific communication through writing, speaking, poster creation/presentation, and social media. This CURE is an attractive introduction to scientific research and was successfully tested with 147 students during the fall semester of 2018."

R.; Hartley, C.; Coxall, O.; Ovseiko, P. V.; Buchan, A. M.; Kiparoglou, V.",Rinita  Dam,2020-02-25,scientific communication and education,"ObjectiveScientific authorship is a vital marker of success in academic careers and gender equity is a key performance metric in research. However, there is little understanding of gender equity in publications in biomedical research centres funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR). This study assesses the gender parity in scientific authorship of biomedical research.

DesignA retrospective descriptive study.

SettingNIHR Oxford Biomedical Research Centre.

Data2409 publications accepted or published from 1 April 2012 to 31 March 2017.

Main outcome measuresGender of authors, defined as a binary variable comprising either male or female categories, in six authorship categories: first author, joint first authors, first corresponding author, joint corresponding authors, last author and joint last authors.

ResultsPublications comprised clinical research (39%, n=939), basic research (27%, n=643), and other types of research (34%, n=827). The proportion of female authors as first author (41%), first corresponding authors (34%) and last author (23%) was statistically significantly lower than male authors in these authorship categories. Of total joint first authors (n=458), joint corresponding authors (n=169), and joint last authors (n=229), female only authors comprised statistically significant smaller proportions i.e. 15% (n=69), 29% (n=49) and 10% (n=23) respectively, compared to male only authors in these joint authorship categories. There was a statistically significant association between gender of the last author(s) with gender of the first author(s) ({chi} 2 33.742, P < 0.001), corresponding author(s) ({chi}2 540.774, P < 0.001) and joint last author(s) ({chi} 2 91.291, P < 0.001).

ConclusionsAlthough there are increasing trends of female authors as first authors (41%) and last authors (23%), female authors are underrepresented compared to male authors in all six categories of scientific authorship in biomedical research. Further research is needed to encourage gender parity in different categories of scientific authorship.

Strengths and limitations of this studyO_LIThis is the first study to investigate gender parity in six categories of scientific authorship: first authors, first corresponding authors, last authors and three joint authorship categories i.e. joint first authors, joint corresponding authors and joint last authors in biomedical research.
C_LIO_LIThis study provides an important benchmark on gender equity in scientific authorship for other NIHR funded centres and organisations in England.
C_LIO_LIThe generalisability of the findings of this study may be limited due to differences in medical specialities, research areas, institutional cultures, and levels of support to individual researchers.
C_LIO_LIUsing secondary sources for determining the gender of authors may have limitations, which could be avoided by seeking relevant information from original authors and institution affiliation at the time of submission.

College undergraduate education is traditionally provided in disciplinary silos, which creates a steep learning curve at the graduate and postdoctoral levels that increasingly bridge multiple disciplines. Numerous colleges have begun to embrace interdisciplinary curricula, but students who double-major in mathematics (or other quantitative sciences) and biology (or medicine) remain scarce. We identified the need to educate junior and senior high school students about integrating mathematical and biological skills, through the lens of mathematical oncology, to better prepare students for future careers at the interdisciplinary interface. The High school Internship Program in Integrated Mathematical Oncology (HIP IMO) at Moffitt Cancer Center has so far trained 59 students between 2015 and 2019. We report here on the program structure, training deliverables, curriculum, and outcomes. We hope to promote such interdisciplinary educational activities early in a students career."

Despite this burden, there is no national SCD programme in Cameroon. This study aimed to assess parents and physicians knowledge of SCD, their satisfaction with the quality of care and their recommendations to improve the treatment of SCD in Cameroon.

MethodsA multi-centre cross-sectional survey was conducted in English and French, using structured questionnaires distributed in electronic format to physicians throughout Cameroon. Paper-based questionnaires were also administered to parents in the West and North West regions of Cameroon. Data were entered into Microsoft Excel and analysed using the SPSS statistical software.

ResultsFifty-four parents and 205 physicians were recruited. We found that 72.2% of parents had good knowledge of SCD, 72.2% of parents were satisfied with the quality of care. Attending a sickle cell clinic (AOR 22, 95% CI 17.70-250) was significantly associated with having good knowledge. Just 14.2% of physicians had good knowledge and 23.3% of physicians were satisfied with the available management standards of SCD. Seeing more than five patients per month (AOR 3.17, 95% CI 1.23-8.20) was significantly associated with having good knowledge. Sickle cell clinics, national guidelines and subsidised treatment were the top three measures proposed by physicians and parents to improve the management of SCD.

ConclusionKnowledge of SCD and satisfaction with care were poor among Cameroonian physicians. There is a need for a national programme and a comprehensive system of care for SCD in Cameroon."

Collaboration is a key factor in scientific advances, and in social species enhanced sociality improves fitness and longevity. Yet whether sociality influences career progression and survival in science, and how this might differ between genders, is largely unknown. We built authorship social networks from publication records to test how sociality predicts career progression and survival in a cohort of biologists contributing to three international conferences in the 1990s. We show that sociality has the strongest effect for female researchers but, regardless of gender, publishing with many diverse co-authors significantly reduces time to become a principal investigator and increases career duration. Publishing repeatedly with co-authors also enhances career progression in both genders, but reduces career length for men. These findings demonstrate that the value of collaboration extends beyond scientific advances, and can directly benefit the career progression and longevity of research scientists themselves. Efforts to encourage researchers at all levels to invest in collaborations, particularly with female researchers, will help to close the gender gap in science and academia."

These issues may abate or intensify during the time they are housed in our facility. After using a guinea pig for research, experimentalists note the apparent health of an animal based on visible features and/or abnormal electrophysiology of the heart. There was an existing anecdotal observation that the health of the Guinea Pigs, and subsequently the experimental success rate, had a seasonal variation; therefore we sought to determine if there is a time of year in which our guinea pigs are more likely to be perceived as unhealthy, and whether any determined monthly pattern correlates with an experimentalists ability to complete an experimental protocol. An electronic log was created to record the perceived health of the animal and the ability to complete the experiment successfully. Irregular symptoms included, but were not limited to, severe weight or hair loss and irregularities with the heart found post thoracotomy or during baseline electrophysiological recordings of whole-heart preparations. Animals that did not exhibit significant weight or hair loss, or other ailments were considered ""healthy"". Overall, our results indicate that there are no monthly variations in perceived Hartley Albino guinea pig health or correlations with experimental completion rates, suggesting mild hair or weight loss that is common when shipping animals may not significantly affect the ability to conduct ex vivo whole-heart electrophysiological studies."

Unfortunately, many biomedical researchers have not received formal computational training and often struggle to produce results that can be reproduced using the same data, code, and methods. Programming workshops can be a tool to teach new computational methods, but it is not always clear whether researchers are able to use their new skills to make their work more computationally reproducible.

MethodsThis mixed methods study consisted of in-depth interviews with 14 biomedical researchers before and after participation in an introductory programming workshop. During the interviews, participants described their research workflows and responded to a quantitative checklist measuring reproducible behaviors. The interview data was analyzed using a thematic analysis approach, and the pre and post workshop checklist scores were compared to assess the impact of the workshop on computational reproducibility of the researchers workflows.

ResultsPre and post scores on a checklist of reproducible behaviors did not increase in a statistically significant manner. The qualitative interviews revealed that several participants had made small changes to their workflows including switching to open source programming languages for their data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. Overall many of the participants indicated higher levels of programming literacy and an interest in further training. Factors that enabled change included supportive environments and an immediate research need, while barriers included collaborators that were resistant to new tools and a lack of time.

ConclusionWhile none of the participants completely changed their workflows, many of them did incorporate new practices, tools, or methods that helped make their work more reproducible and transparent to other researchers. This indicate that programming workshops now offered by libraries and other organizations contribute to computational reproducibility training for researchers"

As such, the demographics of a papers social media audience provide a wealth of information about how scholarly research is transmitted, consumed, and interpreted by online communities. By paying attention to public perceptions of their publications, scientists can learn whether their research is stimulating positive scholarly and public thought. They can also become aware of potentially negative patterns of interest from groups that misinterpret their work in harmful ways, either willfully or unintentionally, and devise strategies for altering their messaging to mitigate these impacts. In this study, we collected 331,696 Twitter posts referencing 1,800 highly tweeted bioRxiv preprints and leveraged topic modeling to infer the characteristics of various communities engaging with each preprint on Twitter. We agnostically learned the characteristics of these audience sectors from keywords each users followers provide in their Twitter biographies. We estimate that 96% of the preprints analyzed are dominated by academic audiences on Twitter, suggesting that social media attention does not always correspond to greater public exposure. We further demonstrate how our audience segmentation method can quantify the level of interest from non-specialist audience sectors such as mental health advocates, dog lovers, video game developers, vegans, bitcoin investors, conspiracy theorists, journalists, religious groups, and political constituencies. Surprisingly, we also found that 10% of the highly tweeted preprints analyzed have sizable (>5%) audience sectors that are associated with right-wing white nationalist communities. Although none of these preprints intentionally espouse any right-wing extremist messages, cases exist where extremist appropriation comprises more than 50% of the tweets referencing a given preprint. These results present unique opportunities for improving and contextualizing research evaluation as well as shedding light on the unavoidable challenges of scientific discourse afforded by social media."

F.",Anna  Severin,2020-03-11,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundWhile the characteristics of scholars who publish in predatory journals are relatively well-understood, nothing is known about the scholars who review for these journals. We aimed to answer the following questions: Can we observe patterns of reviewer characteristics for scholars who review for predatory journals and for legitimate journals? Second, how are reviews for potentially predatory journals distributed globally?

MethodsWe matched random samples of 1,000 predatory journals and 1,000 legitimate journals of the Cabells Scholarly Analytics journal lists with the Publons database of review reports, using the Jaro-Winkler string metric. For reviewers of matched reviews, we descriptively analysed meta-data on reviewing and publishing behaviour.

ResultsWe matched 183,743 unique Publons reviews that were claimed by 19,598 reviewers. 6,077 reviews were conducted for 1160 unique predatory journals (3.31% of all reviews). 177,666 were claimed for 6,403 legitimate journals (96.69% of all reviews). The vast majority of scholars either never or only occasionally submitted reviews for predatory journals to Publons (89.96% and 7.55% of all reviewers, respectively). Smaller numbers of scholars claimed reviews predominantly or exclusively for predatory journals (0.26% and 0.35% of all reviewers, respectively). The two latter groups of scholars are of younger academic age and have fewer publications and fewer reviews than the first two groups of scholars.Developing regions feature larger shares of reviews for predatory reviews than developed regions.

ConclusionThe characteristics of scholars who review for potentially predatory journals resemble those of authors who publish their work in these outlets. In order to combat potentially predatory journals, stakeholders will need to adopt a holistic approach that takes into account the entire research workflow."

The lack of data on many plants, however, limits our understanding of their potential and the possibility of building a research agenda focused on them. Our objective with this systematic review was to identify biodiverse food plants occurring in the Caatinga biome, Brazil, strategic for the promotion of food and nutrition security. We selected studies from the following databases: Web of Science, Medline/PubMed (via the National Library of Medicine), Scopus and Embrapa Agricultural Research Databases (BDPA). Eligible were original articles, published since 2008, studying food plants occurring in the Caatinga. We assessed the methodological quality of the studies we selected. We reviewed a total of fifteen studies in which 65 plants that met our inclusion criteria were mentioned. Of this amount, 17 species, including varieties, subspecies, and different parts of plants, had data on chemical composition, in addition to being mentioned as food consumed by rural communities in observational ethnobotanical studies. From the energy and protein data associated with these plants, we produced a ranking of strategic species. The plants with values higher than the average of the set were: Dioclea grandiflora Mart. ex Benth (mucuna), Hymenaea courbaril L.

M.; Kabona, G.; Mwingira, U.; Simon, A.; Ngondi, J.",Rebecca  M  Flueckiger,2020-03-13,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundProlonged ocular Chlamydial infection, known as trachoma, can lead to trachomatous trichiasis (TT). TT is the stage of trachoma where the eyelid turns inwards, resulting in lashes rubbing against the cornea. TT can damage the cornea, leading to vision impairment or blindness. Treatment for TT includes epilation or surgery. Trachoma is targeted for elimination as a public health problem. One criterion of trachoma elimination is less than 0.2% prevalence of TT unknown to the health system in adults >= 15 years. There are several districts in Tanzania that have not attained this target.

MethodologyWe selected six districts across three regions in Tanzania. Our mixed-methods approach included a retrospective review and analysis of program data and implementation of key informant interviews (KII) and focus group discussions (FGD).

The desk review collated data on district-level indicators and generated estimates around number and proportion of cases not identified by case finders and cases lost along the continuum of care. KIIs and FGDs guides were structured to enlist responses around case finding techniques, linkage to services and TT surgery process.

ConclusionWe found a substantial proportion (13%) of TT positive people were not being identified by case finders, and of those identified, majority (72%) were lost along the continuum of care. These factors likely contribute to high TT prevalence in districts where surgical interventions are ongoing. Engaging community leaders to share TT information and enlisting people who have received surgery to witness in communities may encourage consent of examination by case finders and increase surgical uptake. After witnessing positive effects of surgery, many interviewees who had previously declined surgery changed their mind. Increasing frequency of surgical camps would improve access to these populations. Additionally, giving more notice about surgical camps and extending duration is important to enable remote populations to obtain services.

Author SummaryTreatment for trachomatous trichiasis (TT) includes epilation or surgery. There are several districts in Tanzania that have struggled to link people with TT to services. It is important for the program to understand why this is the case to inform program adaptations for improved linkage to services. We implemented a mixed methods approach to address this knowledge gap. We found a large portion of TT positive people are not being identified by case finders and of those identified, many are lost along the continuum of care. These factors are likely contributing to the unexpectedly high TT prevalence in districts where surgical interventions are ongoing. Barriers to identifying cases included remoteness, case finder credibility, knowledge of TT, and case finder motivation. Once cases are identified, the largest gap along the continuum of care is the link between being identified and screened. We found barriers to attending screenings and subsequently obtaining treatment to be fear of surgery, distance from surgical camps, agricultural season, time to plan, awareness and frequency of camps, and lack of assistance after surgery."

It contains the largest number of abstracts and articles cited in peer reviewed publications. The journals included in Scopus are periodically re-evaluated to ensure they meet indexing criteria. Afterwards, some journals might be discontinued for publication concerns. Despite their discontinuation, previously published articles remain indexed and continue to be cited. The metrics and characteristics of journals discontinued for publication concerns have yet to be studied. This study aimed (1) to evaluate the main features and citation metrics of journals discontinued from Scopus for publication concerns, before and after discontinuation, and (2) to determine the extent of predatory journals among the discontinued journals.Materials and Methods Eight authors surveyed a list of discontinued journals from Scopus (version July 2019). Data regarding metrics, citations and indexing were extracted from Scopus or other scientific databases, for the journals discontinued for publication concerns.Results A total of 317 journals were evaluated. The mean number of citations per year after discontinuation was significantly higher than before (median of difference 64 citations, p&lt;0.0001), and so was the number of citations per document (median of difference 0.4 citations, p&lt;0.0001). The total number of citations after discontinuation was 607,261, with a median of 713 citations (IQR 254-2056, range 0-19468) per journal. The open access publishing model was declared for 93% (294/317) of the journals, but only nine of these are currently indexed in the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ). Twenty-two percent (72/317) of the journals were included in the Cabell blacklist.Conclusions The citation count of journals discontinued for publication concerns, increases despite discontinuation. Countermeasures should be taken to ensure the validity and reliability of Scopus metrics both at journal- and author-level for the purpose of scientific assessment of publishing.View Full Text"

We examined seven numerical characteristics of reference lists of 50,878 primary research articles published in 17 ecological journals between 1997 and 2017. Over this 20-years period, there have been significant changes in reference lists’ properties. On average, more recent ecological papers have longer reference lists, cite more high Impact Factor papers, and fewer non-journal publications. Furthermore, we show that highly cited papers across the ecology literature have longer reference lists, cite more recent and impactful papers, and account for more self-citations. Conversely, the proportion of ‘classic’ papers and non-journal publications cited, as well as the temporal range of the reference list, have no significant influence on articles’ citations. From this analysis, we distill a recipe for crafting impactful reference lists.View Full Text"

However, even with recent advances in machine learning, experience with anatomic pathology shows that there is no immediate substitute for expert visual review, annotation, and description of tissue images. In this perspective we review the ecosystem of software available for analysis of tissue images and identify a need for interactive guides or ""digital docents"" that allow experts to help make complex images intelligible. We illustrate this idea using Minerva software and discuss how interactive image guides are being integrated into multi-omic browsers for effective dissemination of atlas data."

We examined this question by surveying the constituency of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as a proxy for the conservation community, generating 2,285 responses. Of these respondents, ∼97% need to use the scientific literature in order to support their IUCN-related conservation work, with ∼50% needing to do so at least once per week. The crux of the survey revolved around the question, “How easy is it for you currently to obtain the scientific literature you need to carry out your IUCN-related work?” and revealed that roughly half (49%) of the respondents find it not easy or not at all easy to access scientific literature. We fitted a binary logistic regression model to explore factors predicting ease of literature access. Whether the respondent had institutional literature access (55% do) is the strongest predictor, with region (Western Europe, the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand) and gender (male) also significant predictors. Approximately 60% of respondents from Western Europe, the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand have institutional access compared to ∼50% in Asia and Latin America, and ∼40% in Eastern Europe and in Africa. Nevertheless, accessing free online material is a popular means of accessing literature for both those with and without institutional access. The four journals most frequently mentioned when asked which journal access would deliver the greatest improvements to the respondent’s IUCN-related work were Conservation Biology, Biological Conservation, Nature, and Science. The majority prefer to read journal articles on screen but prefer to read books in hard copy. Overall, it is apparent that access to the literature is a challenge facing roughly half of the conservation community worldwide.View Full Text"

These meetings have largely been held in-person with rapid proliferation in the number of meetings and attendees. Yet the format and quality of their organization lag behind what is possible and as a result, the current experience of attending conferences in many disciplines remains unchanged in many respects. We created a database of 270 national and international academic conferences held in-person during 2018-2019 in various disciplines and examined them for their features, costs and impact on the community. We found that many meetings could still be improved significantly in terms of diversity, inclusivity, promoting early career researcher (ECR) networking and career development, venue accessibility, and importantly, reducing the meetings carbon footprint. It is important to accelerate and mandate efforts to improve conferences so that researchers in all disciplines, in particular ECRs, consistently benefit from scientific gatherings, for years to come. We discuss a combination of approaches and recommendations to make conferences more modern, effective, equitable and intellectually productive for the research community and environmentally sustainable for our planet.

We then compared the performance of our residual-matching method against random sampling in their probabilities of achieving a given level of statistical power as well as their prediction accuracies. Results showed that the residual-matching method was superior to random sampling, yielding smaller sample sizes with equivalent mean square error. We therefore advocate the use of residual matching when scaling up pilot studies to conserve time and resources in larger follow-up studies.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text"

Specifically, how strongly these programs are being implemented across a health facility’s catchment area in Malawi and the odds of a woman in that catchment area is using modern contraceptives. This information can be used to assess whether the combined impact of multiple large-scale FP programs is leading to change in the health outcomes they aim to improve.Methods and findings We used data from the 2017 Implementation Strength Assessment (ISA) that quantified how much of family planning programs at the health facility and community health worker levels were being implemented across every district of Malawi. We used a summary measure developed in a previous study that employs quantitative methods to combine data across FP domains and health system levels. We tested the association of this summary measure for implementation strength with household data from the 2015 Malawi Demographic Health Survey (DHS). We found that areas with stronger implementation of FP programs had higher odds of women using modern contraceptives compared with areas with weaker implementation. The association of ISA with use of modern contraception was different by education, marital status, and geography. After controlling for these factors, we found that the adjusted odds of using a modern contraceptive was three times higher in catchment areas with high implementation strength compared to those with lower strength.Conclusion Metrics that summarize how strongly FP programs are being implemented were used to show a statistically significantly positive relationship between increasing implementation strength and higher rates of modern contraceptive use. Decisionmakers at the various levels of health authority can use this type of summary measure to better understand the combined impact of their diverse FP programming and inform future programmatic and policy decisions. The findings also reinforce the idea that having a well-supported and supplied cadre of community health workers supplementing FP provision at the health facility can be an important health systems mechanism, especially in rural settings and to target youth populations.View Full Text"

Horbach,2020-04-18,scientific communication and education,"In times of public crises, including the current Covid-19 pandemic, rapid dissemination of relevant scientific knowledge is of paramount importance. The duration of scholarly journals’ publication process is one of the main factors hindering quick delivery of new information. While proper editorial assessment and peer review obviously require some time, turnaround times for medical journals can be up to several months, which is undesirable in the era of a crisis. Following initiatives of medical journals and scholarly publishers to accelerate their publication process, this study assesses whether medical journals have indeed managed to speed up their publication process for Covid-19 related articles. It studies the duration of 14 medical journals’ publication process both during and prior to the current pandemic. Assessing a total of 669 articles, the study concludes that medical journals have indeed drastically accelerated the publication process for Covid-19 related articles since the outbreak of the pandemic. Compared to articles published in the same journals before the pandemic, turnaround times have decreased on average by 49%. The largest decrease in number of days between submission and publication of articles was due to a decrease in the number of days required for peer review. For articles not related to Covid-19, no acceleration of the publication process is found. While the acceleration of journals’ publication process is laudable from the perspective of quick information dissemination, it also raises concerns relating to the quality of the peer review process and the quality of the resulting publications.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text"

E. coli antibiotic resistance was highest to tetracycline (81.4%) and lowest to imipenem (0.7%). The antibiotic susceptibility profile revealed 55% (154/280) multidrug resistant E. coli, with the highest multidrug resistance profile (20.7%) in the ampicillin-tetracycline-trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole drug combination. Furthermore, 4.3% (12/280) of the isolates showed Extensive Drug resistance. The levels of antimicrobial resistance to E. coli and Salmonella observed in market-ready chickens is of public health concern.View Full Text"

We exploit these conditions to empirically identify effects of exposure to the 1918 flu pandemic, those of the devastation left by an earthquake-tsunami that struck the island in 1918, and those associated with the joint occurrence of these events. We use geographic variation to identify the effects of the quake and timing of birth variation to identify those of the flu. In addition, we use markers of nutritional status gathered in a nationally representative sample of individuals aged 75 and older in 2002. This unique data set enables to make two distinct contributions. First, unlike most fetal-origins research that singles out early nutritional status as a determinant of adult health, we test the hypothesis that the 1918 flu had deleterious effects on the nutritional status on adult survivors who at the time of the flu were in utero or infants. Second, and unlike most research on the effects of the flu, we focus on markers of nutritional status set when the adult survivors were children or adolescents. We find that estimates of effects of the pandemic are sizeable primarily among females and among those who, in addition to the flu, were exposed to the earthquake-tsunami. We argue that these findings constitute empirical evidence supporting the conjecture that effects of the 1918 flu alone and the combined effects of the flu and the earthquake are associated not just with damage experienced during the fetal period but also postnatally.View Full Text"

However, little is known about which countries are participating or how they collaborate with each other. Here, we present an analysis of all 67,885 preprints posted on bioRxiv (through 2019) using the first comprehensive dataset of country-level preprint author affiliations. We find the plurality of preprints (39%) come from the United States, and that countries such as the U.S. and U.K. are overrepresented on bioRxiv relative to their overall scientific output, while countries including China, Russia, and Turkey show lower bioRxiv adoption. We describe a set of ""contributor countries"" including Uganda, Croatia and Thailand that appear almost exclusively as non-senior authors on international collaborations. Lastly, we find multiple journals that publish a disproportionate number of preprints from some countries, a dynamic that almost always benefits manuscripts from the U.S."

We use a dataset of publications curated by Dimensions and analyze articles and preprints. Our sample includes 11,686 publications of which 67.5% are openly accessible. OA publications tend to receive the largest share of social media attention as measured by the Altmetric Attention Score. 37.6% of OA publications are bronze, which means toll journals are providing free access. MedRxiv contributes to 36.3% of documents in repositories but papers in BiorXiv exhibit on average higher AAS. We predict the growth of COVID-19 literature in the following 30 days estimating ARIMA models for the overall publications set, OA vs. non OA and by location of the document (repository vs. journal). We estimate that COVID-19 publications will double in the next 20 days, but non OA publications will grow at a higher rate than OA publications.

10.1101/2020.04.27.063578,A systematic examination of preprint platforms for use in the medical and biomedical sciences setting,"Kirkham, J. J.; Penfold, N.; Murphy, F.; Boutron, I.; Ioannidis, J. P.; Polka, J. K.; Moher, D.",Jamie J Kirkham,2020-04-28,scientific communication and education,"ABSTRACTObjectives The objective of this review is to identify all preprint platforms with biomedical and medical scope and to compare and contrast the key characteristics and policies of these platforms. We also aim to provide a searchable database to enable relevant stakeholders to compare between platforms.Study Design and Setting Preprint platforms that were launched up to 25th June 2019 and have a biomedical and medical scope according to MEDLINE’s journal selection criteria were identified using existing lists, web-based searches and the expertise of both academic and non-academic publication scientists. A data extraction form was developed, pilot-tested and used to collect data from each preprint platform’s webpage(s). Data collected were in relation to scope and ownership; content-specific characteristics and information relating to submission, journal transfer options, and external discoverability; screening, moderation, and permanence of content; usage metrics and metadata. Where possible, all online data were verified by the platform owner or representative by correspondence.Results A total of 44 preprint platforms were identified as having biomedical and medical scope, 17 (39%) were hosted by the Open Science Framework preprint infrastructure, six (14%) were provided by F1000 Research Ltd (the Open Research Central infrastructure) and 21 (48%) were other independent preprint platforms. Preprint platforms were either owned by non-profit academic groups, scientific societies or funding organisations (n=28; 64%), owned/partly owned by for-profit publishers or companies (n=14; 32%) or owned by individuals/small communities (n=2; 5%). Twenty-four (55%) preprint platforms accepted content from all scientific fields although some of these had restrictions relating to funding source, geographical region or an affiliated journal’s remit. Thirty-three (75%) preprint platforms provided details about article screening (basic checks) and 14 (32%) of these actively involved researchers with context expertise in the screening process. The three most common screening checks related to the scope of the article, plagiarism and legal/ethical/societal issues and compliance. Almost all preprint platforms allow submission to any peer-reviewed journal following publication, have a preservation plan for read-access, and most have a policy regarding reasons for retraction and the sustainability of the service. Forty-one (93%) platforms currently have usage metrics, with the most common metric being the number of downloads presented on the abstract page.Conclusion A large number of preprint platforms exist for use in biomedical and medical sciences, all of which offer researchers an opportunity to rapidly disseminate their research findings onto an open-access public server, subject to scope and eligibility. However, the process by which content is screened before online posting and withdrawn or removed after posting varies between platforms, which may be associated with platform operation, ownership, governance and financing.In concurrence with an increase in the number of preprint servers and platforms supporting biomedical and medical sciences research since 2013, there has been substantial growth in the number of preprints posted in this research area.The significant benefits of accelerated dissemination of research that preprints offer has attracted the support of many major funders.The raised profile of preprints has led to their wider acceptance in institutional and individual level assessment.This is the first full examination of the characteristics and policies of 44 preprint platforms with biomedical and medical scope. We use a robust methodological approach to extract relevant information from web-based material with input from preprint platform owners.Despite concerns regarding the permanence and quality of preprints, most preprint platforms have long-term preservation strategies and many have screening checks (for example, a basic check for the relevance of content) in place. For some platforms, these checks are performed by researchers with content expertise.We provide a searchable database as a valuable resource for researchers, funders and policymakers in the biomedical and medical science field to determine which preprint platforms are relevant to their research scope and which have the functionality and policies that they value most.Competing Interest StatementJessica Polka is Executive Director of ASAPbio.View Full Text"
10.1101/2020.04.26.048306,The case for formal methodology in scientific reform,"Devezer, B.; Navarro, D. J.; Vandekerckhove, J.; Buzbas, E. O.",Berna  Devezer,2020-04-28,scientific communication and education,"Current attempts at methodological reform in sciences come in response to an overall lack of rigor in methodological and scientific practices in experimental sciences. However, most methodological reform attempts suffer from similar mistakes and over-generalizations to the ones they aim to address. We argue that this can be attributed in part to lack of formalism and first principles. Considering the costs of allowing false claims to become canonized, we argue for formal statistical rigor and scientific nuance in methodological reform. To attain this rigor and nuance, we propose a five-step formal approach for solving methodological problems. To illustrate the use and benefits of such formalism, we present a formal statistical analysis of three popular claims in the metascientific literature: (a) that reproducibility is the cornerstone of science; (b) that data must not be used twice in any analysis; and (c) that exploratory projects imply poor statistical practice. We show how our formal approach can inform and shape debates about such methodological claims."

While spider bites are statistically rare events, our perception is skewed towards the potential harm spiders can cause to humans. We examined the human dimension of spiders through the lens of traditional media, by analysing more than 300 spider-related news published online in Italian newspapers between 2010 and 2020. We observed a recent, exponential increase in the frequency of the news, particularly those focused on medically important spiders – the Mediterranean black widow (Latrodectus tredecimguttatus) and the Mediterranean recluse (Loxosceles refescens). The news quality was generally poor: 70% contained different types of error, 32% were exaggerated, and in virtually none was an expert consulted. Overstated news referring to spider bites were significantly more shared on social media, thus contributing to frame a distorted perception of the risk associated with a spider bite and possibly reducing general public tolerance of spiders.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text"

Nearly seven thousand publications, which comprise the entirety of retractions visible through PubMed as of August 2019, were used. This work involved sophisticated data collection and analysis techniques to use data from PubMed, Wikipedia, and WikiData, and study it with respect to the above mentioned axes. Importantly, I employ state-of-the-art analysis and visualization techniques from natural language processing (NLP) to understand the topics in retracted literature. To highlight a few results, the analyses demonstrate an increasing rate of retraction over time and noticeable differences in the publication quality (as measured by journal impact factor) among top countries. Moreover, while molecular biology and cancer dominate retractions, we also see a number of retractions not related to biology. The methods and results of this study can be applied to continuously understand the nature and evolution of retractions in life sciences, thus contributing to the health of this research ecosystem."

In this brief report, we sought to identify the prevalence of limitations statements in the medRxiv COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2 dataset.Methods We combined automated methods with manual review to analyse manuscripts for the presence, or absence, either of a defined limitations section in the text, or as part of the general discussion.Results We identified a structured limitations statement in 28% of the manuscripts, and overall 52% contained at least one mention of a study limitation. Over one-third of manuscripts contained none of the terms that might typically be associated with reporting of limitations. Overall our method performed with precision of 0.97 and recall of 0.91.Conclusion The presence or absence of limitations statements can be identified with reasonable confidence using automated tools. We suggest that it might be beneficial to require a defined, structured statement about study limitations, either as part of the submission process, or clearly delineated within the manuscript.Competing Interest StatementThe authors are the founders and shareholders of Scholarcy Limited.

The fact of matter is the clinical inconsistence with experimental outcomes still exist due to the mechanism has not been entirely clarified. Dexmedetomidine (DEX), a new generation anti-inflammatory and organ protector, has been testified can attenuate the IRI of heart. This study aimed to find out if DEX had the capacity to protect the injured cardiomyocytes under in vitro hypoxia/reoxygenation circumstance and if the ERS was totally or partly intervened.Methods H9C2 cells were subjected to cytotoxicity detection for 24h with DEX normally cultivated in several different concentrations. The proper hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) model parameter were concluded by the cell viability and injuries by cell counting kit-8(CCK8) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, when undergoing hypoxic condition for 3 h and reoxygenated for 3h, 6h,12h, and 24h, respectively. Also, the above index was assessed for H/R cardiomyocytes cultivated by various concentrations of DEX. The apoptosis, expression of) Glucose-regulated protein 78(GRP78), C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), and caspase-12 were also examined in all groups.Results 1, 5 and 10 μM DEX in normal culture could significantly promote the proliferation of H9C2 (&gt; 80%); the activity of H9c2 cells decreased to 62.67% (P &lt; 0.05) at 3h of reoxygenation and to 36% at 6h of reoxygenation followed by 3h anoxic treatment; The cell viability of H9c2 cells in H/R groups incubated with 1 μM DEX increased 61.3%, and the LDH concentration in the supernatant was effectively lowered (−13.7, P &lt; 0.05); H/R dramatically decreased the proportion of flow cytometry apoptosis and increased the expression of GRP78, CHOP and caspase-12, while both DEX and 4-phenyl butyric acid (4-PBA) could significantly reverse those above indicators. Additionally, DEX could induce deeper alterations than 4-PBA on the basis of H/R.Conclusion 1 μM DEX can dramatically attended the cell injuries, apoptosis, the expression of GRP78, CHOP and caspase-12 of H9C2 induced by 3h’ hypoxia and 3h’s reoxygenation. moreover, the functions of DEX went beyond the inhibition of ERS under this situation.View Full Text"

In Kenya, cervical cancer incidence and prevalence have been increasing and in 2018 alone, there were 3286 deaths from cervical cancer. Previously, studies on cervical cancer prevention strategies have focused on women above 30 years old. However, as the risk factors for cervical cancer are acquired as early as in the teen years, an understanding of the awareness, uptake and determinants of screening services among college female students will help inform prevention strategies. This study sought to determine the awareness, uptake, determinants and barriers to cervical cancer screening services among colleges students in Kenya.Methods This was a multicenter cross-sectional study conducted in eight universities spread all over Kenya. Participants were interviewed using a self-administered structured questionnaire on sociodemographics, reproductive history, awareness on cervical cancer including screening practices, and attitude towards cervical cancer prevention services. Descriptive statistics were summarized using means and standard deviation (SD) for parametric data and median and interquartile range (IQR) for non-parametric data. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were done to determine odds ratios of factors associated with uptake of cervical cancer screening services. P-value of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.Results Between January 2017 and Sept 2017, we screened 800 and enrolled 600 female colleges students from eight universities in Kenya. In total, 549 of the 600 (92%) participants completed the questionnaire. The median age (IQR) was 21(20,22) years. Nearly two-thirds 338(62.7%) were sexually active, while 54(16%) had concurrent sexual partners. The main form of contraception was oral postcoital emergency pills 123(64.7%). Only 76(14.4%) had screened for cervical cancer, and the commonest approach was a Pap smear 47(61.8%). About one half 40(54.1%) did not like their experience due to pain, discomfort and bleeding. Four out of five participants (439, 80.7%) had poor knowledge on cervical cancer screening. On bivariate analysis, increased level of awareness (odds ratio [OR] 1.08 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.03,1.18, p = 0.004), knowledge of someone with cervical cancer(OR 0.43 CI 0.23,0.78 p=0.006) and a perception of self-risk (OR2.6 CI 1.38,4.98 p=0.003) were associated with increased odds of uptake of cervical cancer screening. In the multivariate analysis, high awareness was significantly associated with increased odds of cervical cancer screening (OR 1.12 CI 1.04, 1.20 p=0.002).Conclusions Female college students in Kenya had low levels of awareness on cervical cancer and had very low uptake of cervical cancer screening. However, high perception of self-risk and perceived benefit was associated with increased odds of cervical cancer screening.Recommendations Since female colleges students are generally thought to be more knowledgeable and have better access to information compared to the general population, the low levels of knowledge and uptake of cervical cancer screening, calls for a rethink of strategies that focus on the younger population including those in primary, high school and universities. Such strategies include HPV vaccination and incorporation of cancer prevention in school curriculum.View Full Text"

Martins dos Santos,2020-05-09,scientific communication and education,"Rational lifestyle engineering using computational methods and synthetic biology has made it possible to genetically improve industrial performance of microbial cell factories for the production of a range of biobased chemicals. However, only an estimated 1 in 5,000 to 10,000 innovations make it through the Valley of Death to market implementation.To gain in-depth insights into the views of industry and academia on key bottlenecks and opportunities to reach market implementation, a qualitative and exploratory study was performed by conducting 12 in depth interviews with 8 industrial and 4 academic participants. The characteristics that any cell factory must have were schematically listed, and commonly recognised opportunities were identified.We found that academics are limited by only technical factors in their research, while industry is restricted in their research choices and flexibility by a series of technical, sector dependent and social factors. This leads to a misalignment of interest of academics and funding industrial partners, often resulting in miscommunication. Although both are of the opinion that academia must perform curiosity-driven research to find innovative solutions, there is a certain pressure to aim for short-term industrial applications. All these factors add up to the Valley of Death; the gap between development and market implementation.A third party, in the form of start-up companies, could be the answer to bridging the Valley of Death.View Full Text"

On the 4th of March, the Italian government orders the full closure of all schools and universities nationwide.The aim of this study is to investigate the knowledge, practice and attitudes (KAP) of secondary school at the time of COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. In this cross-sectional, web-based survey, conducted among the high school student population with age ranging from 14 to 19 years old, a questionnaire with 19 items regarding the KAP toward COVID-19 is asked. Study participants are recruited from several secondary schools of different areas. Frequencies and histograms are computed for descriptive purposes. Statistical analysis is computed with Chi square test, utilized to depict relevant difference between geender. Among a total of 2380 students who answers the questionnaire, 40.7% are male and 59.3% are female.Level of knowledge about generical characteristics of COVID-19 is quite similar among gender. Students present a good level of knowledge about the clinical presentation of the disease, the basic hygiene principles, the modes of transmission and the method of protection against virus transmission. The knowledge about number of this pandemia and easy scientific correlation with COVID-19 is quite confused. The most frequently reported source of knowledge about COVID-19 is television, whereas the less is the school.

However, no standardized way of reporting Open Data in publications exists, making it difficult to find shared datasets and assess the prevalence of Open Data in an automated fashion.We developed ODDPub (Open Data Detection in Publications), a text-mining algorithm that screens biomedical publications and detects cases of Open Data. Using English-language original research publications from a single biomedical research institution (n=8689) and randomly selected from PubMed (n=1500) we iteratively developed a set of derived keyword categories. ODDPub can detect data sharing through field-specific repositories, general-purpose repositories or the supplement. Additionally, it can detect shared analysis code (Open Code).To validate ODDPub, we manually screened 792 publications randomly selected from PubMed. On this validation dataset, our algorithm detected Open Data publications with a sensitivity of 0.74 and specificity of 0.97. Open Data was detected for 11.5% (n=91) of publications. Open Code was detected for 1.4% (n=11) of publications with a sensitivity of 0.73 and specificity of 1.00. We compared our results to the linked datasets found in the databases PubMed and Web of Science.Our algorithm can automatically screen large numbers of publications for Open Data. It can thus be used to assess Open Data sharing rates on the level of subject areas, journals, or institutions. It can also identify individual Open Data publications in a larger publication corpus.

During the first few months of the pandemic, over 5,200 new Wikipedia pages on COVID-19 have been created and have accumulated over 400M pageviews by mid June 2020.1 At the same time, an unprecedented amount of scientific articles on COVID-19 and the ongoing pandemic have been published online. Wikipedias contents are based on reliable sources such as scientific literature. Given its public function, it is crucial for Wikipedia to rely on representative and reliable scientific results, especially so in a time of crisis. We assess the coverage of COVID-19-related research in Wikipedia via citations to a corpus of over 160,000 articles. We find that Wikipedia editors are integrating new research at a fast pace, and have cited close to 2% of the COVID-19 literature under consideration. While doing so, they are able to provide a representative coverage of COVID-19-related research. We show that all the main topics discussed in this literature are proportionally represented from Wikipedia, after accounting for article-level effects. We further use regression analyses to model citations from Wikipedia and show that Wikipedia editors on average rely on literature which is highly cited, widely shared on social media, and has been peer-reviewed."

R.",Lauren A Maggio,2020-05-13,scientific communication and education,"Purpose This bibliometric analysis maps the landscape of knowledge syntheses in medical education. It provides scholars with a roadmap for understanding where the field has been and where it might go in the future. In particular, this analysis details the venues in which knowledge syntheses are published, the types of syntheses conducted, citation rates they produce, and altmetric attention they garner.Method In 2020, the authors conducted a bibliometric analysis of knowledge syntheses published in 14 core medical education journals from 1999 to 2019. To characterize the studies, metadata was extracted from Pubmed, Web of Science, Altmetrics Explorer, and Unpaywall.Results The authors analyzed 963 knowledge syntheses representing 3.1% of total articles published (n=30,597). On average, 45.9 knowledge syntheses were published annually (SD=35.85, Median=33), and there was an overall 2,620% increase in the number of knowledge syntheses published from 1999 to 2019. The journals each published, on average, a total of 68.8 knowledge syntheses (SD=67.2, Median=41) with Medical Education publishing the most (n=189; 19%). Twenty-one knowledge synthesis types were identified; the most prevalent types were systematic reviews (n=341; 35.4%) and scoping reviews (n=88; 9.1%). Knowledge syntheses were cited an average of 53.80 times (SD=107.12, Median=19) and received a mean Altmetric Attention Score of 14.12 (SD=37.59, Median=6).Conclusions There has been considerable growth in knowledge syntheses in medical education over the past 20 years, contributing to medical education’s evidence base. Beyond this increase in volume, researchers have introduced methodological diversity in these publications, and the community has taken to social media to share knowledge syntheses. Implications for the field, including the impact of synthesis types and their relationship to knowledge translation, are discussed.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text"

B.; Simunovic, F.",Filip  Simunovic,2020-05-13,scientific communication and education,"Background Three-dimensional (3D) scanning is an established method of breast volume estimation. However, this method can never be entirely precise, since the thoracic wall cannot be imaged by the surface scanner. Current methods rely on interpolation of the posterior breast border from the surrounding thoracic wall. Here, we present a novel method to calculate the posterior border and increase the accuracy of the measurement.Methods Using principal component analysis, computed tomography images were used to build a statistical shape model (SSM) of the thoracic wall. The model was fitted to 3D images and the missing thoracic wall curvature interpolated (indirect volumetry). The calculations were evaluated by ordinary least squares regression between the preoperative and postoperative volume differences and the resection weights in breast reduction surgery (N=36). Also, an SSM of the breast was developed, allowing direct volumetry. Magnetic-resonance images (MRI) and 3D scans were acquired from 5 patients in order to validate the direct 3D volumetry.Results Volumetry based on a SSM exhibited a higher determination coefficient (R2=0,737) than the interpolation method (R2=0,404). The methods were not equivalent (p=0.75), suggesting that the methods significantly differ. There was no influence of BMI on the correlation in either method. The MRI volumetry had a strong correlation with the 3D volumetry (R2=0,978).Conclusion The SSM-based method of posterior breast border calculation is reliable and superior to the currently used method of interpolation. It should serve as a basis of software applications aiming at calculation of breast volume from 3D surface scanning data.View Full Text"

S.",Diane S Srivastava,2020-05-14,scientific communication and education,"ABSTRACTA critical part of science is the extraction of general principles by synthesizing results from many different studies or disciplines. In the fields of ecology and evolution, a popular method to conduct synthesis science is in working groups – that is, research collaborations based around intensive week-long meetings. We present in this report an analysis of the impact of working group participation and gender on the publication impact of ecology and evolution faculty at Canadian universities who were research active over the last three decades (N=1408). Women are underrepresented in this research population relative to the general population, and even the Canadian faculty population. Participation in working groups not only benefits science, but also benefits the researchers involved by accelerating the temporal increase in their H-index. However, this benefit is particularly driven by senior male researchers. The effect is weaker for female researchers and even negative for researchers within 4 years of their PhD. However, gender does not affect current participation rates in working groups, nor reported indirect benefits – such as future collaborations, funding and data resources. The results of this study suggest that working groups can act as career catalysts for researchers, but that – as in many areas of science – there are challenging issues of equity that require action. Because the H-index is a cumulative measure, gender inequities from before the turn of the millenium may still be distorting the perceived publication impact of today’s research-active faculty.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text"

M.; Yagos, W. O.; Abelle, P.; Moro, E. B.; Huck, J.; Redmond, A.; Nirmalan, M.",Mahesh  Nirmalan,2021-07-21,scientific communication and education,"BACKGROUNDThere is a widely reported preponderance of major limb loss in Northern Uganda, which is believed to have been caused in large part by prolonged civil war. Access to rehabilitation facilities is extremely limited, and there has never been a study to understand how many people have major limb loss, nor how many of them have had access to medical or rehabilitative services.

AIMThe first prevalence study of disability and major limb loss in the region, and evaluated spatial patterns of cases of MLL.

DESIGNCross-sectional survey.

SETTINGThis research was undertaken in a community setting (at subjects homes).

POPULATION7,864 randomly selected households throughout the Acholi Sub-Region of Northern Uganda.

METHODSThis study comprised two questionnaires, the first to be completed by the head of every sampled household (n=7,864), and the second by any member of the household with major limb loss (n=181). Household locations were examined for spatial autocorrelation using Morans I statistic. The {chi}2 goodness of fit statistic was used to profile those with major limb loss in comparison with the underlying population.

RESULTSWe conservatively estimate that there are c.10,117 people with major limb loss in the region who require long-term rehabilitation services (c.0.5% of the population), and c.150,512 people with disabilities other than MLL (c.8.2% of the population). People with major limb loss are spread throughout the region (as opposed to clustered in specific locations) and are disproportionately male, older and less well educated than the general population.

CONCLUSIONThis research demonstrates, for the first time, the extent of the inadequacy of long-term rehabilitation services for those with major limb-loss in the study area. We provide new insight into the reasons that people are not accessing medical and rehabilitative services, and propose a way forward through the successful demonstration of an  outreach clinic model.

CLINICAL REHABILITATION IMPACTThe discovery of the spatial pattern of those with major limb loss, alongside the demonstration of the clinical outreach model, provides a compelling argument for the need of more such services and associated policy frameworks in remote and rural regions in the Global South.

S.",Toluwalase  Anthony  Aiyelari,2020-05-18,scientific communication and education,"This 3 × 2 factorial study involving three diets at two stocking densities tested the effect of replacing fish meal (FM) with either soybean meal (SBM) or rapeseed meal (RSM) in diets on growth and body composition of zebrafish (Danio rerio). Fish were fed three times daily for eight weeks. Morphometric and water quality parameters were also determined. The survival rate of the fish ranged from 95.2 - 97.8%. The water quality remained within the acceptable limits for tropical aquaculture. The stocking density did not show any significant difference (p&gt;0.05) for the length and weight of the fish. The length, weight and condition factors were significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) in the fish fed FM based diet. The fish length and weight related well (R2) across the diets but this was more significant for RSM than those fed the other two diets. The weight gain (WG), feed conversion ratio (FCR) and protein intake (PI) were significantly higher (p&lt;0.05) in the fish fed the FM based diet than the other diets. No significant differences observed (p&gt;0.05) in the specific growth rate (SGR), food intake (FI) and protein efficiency ratio (PER) among the fish fed the three diets. The crude protein CP, nitrogen-free extract (NFE) and ash contents of these fish did not differ significantly (p&gt;0.05).

The Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program was established by the China Ministry of Education to foster the scientific interests and experiences of undergraduate students. Here, we reported on an innovative project-oriented learning (POL) system directed by Taishan Medical University (Named Shandong First Medical University &amp; Shandong Academy of Sciences since February 2019) China, which fused innovative project with biochemical course concepts. This study takes reverse genetics, which is considered to be difficult to understand through course-only learning, as an example. To help undergraduate students understand the principle of reverse genetics, the project involved producing hepatitis C virus in vitro. Furthermore, to give them a comprehensive scientific experience based on their knowledge from textbook, extensive mentorship was provided through the project, including theoretical guidance and technical support for experiments. Assessment showed a comprehensive improvement after participating in these programs. In conclusion, this POL system was a good model that enabled undergraduates to learn more during courses. It also provided a chance to experience hands-on sciences, which might motivate them to pursue a career in science.View Full Text"

A mixed methods approach, using qualitative and quantitative methods, was used to address three research questions. 1) Based on affective evidence, how did secondary school students perceive and critically judge, content topics learned in a course on modern genomic principles and practices? 2) Based on cognitive evidence, how much of the content did secondary school students learn when they participated in a course on modern genomic principles and practices? 3) Using individual interview evidence, what are the major perceptions that the secondary school students expressed throughout the duration of the course? The participants were provided an opportunity to comment on the course through individual and collaborative interviews, in order to find out to what extent they perceived the course to be interesting and challenging. Future inquiry expanding from this research would help to establish the foundational pathway for designing a more inclusive genomics curriculum. In conclusion, the course offered real-life/real-world applications that encourage all students to conceptualize genomics, human health, diseases, medicine, ethics, beliefs, research, and careers.View Full Text"

Both types of gillnets were made of 0.55 mm Ø monofilaments. However, since the biodegradable nets are weaker than nylon PA nets when using the same monofilament diameter, we also used biodegradable nets made of 0.60 mm Ø monofilament that had a similar tensile strength to the 0.55 mm Ø nylon PA nets. The relative catch efficiency of the different gillnet types was evaluated over the 2018 autumn fishing season for saithe and cod in northern Norway. For cod, both biodegradable gillnets (0.55 and 0.60 mm) had a significantly lower catch efficiency compared to the traditional nylon PA net (0.55 mm) with estimated catch efficiencies of 62.38% (CI: 50.55–74.04) and 54.96% (CI: 35.42–73.52) compared with the nylon PA net, respectively. Similarly for saithe, both biodegradable gillnets (0.55 and 0.60 mm) had a lower estimated catch efficiency compared to the traditional nylon PA net (0.55 mm) with estimated catch efficiencies of 83.40% (71.34–94.86) and 83.87% (66.36–104.92), compared with the nylon PA net, respectively. Tensile strength does not explain the differences in catch efficiency between the two gillnet types, since increasing the twine diameter of the biodegradable gillnets (to match the strength of nylon PA gillnets) did not yield similar catch efficiencies. However, the elasticity and stiffness of the materials may be responsible for the differences in catch efficiency between the nylon PA and biodegradable gillnets.View Full Text"

S.",Shishir P.S. Chundawat,2020-05-23,scientific communication and education,"Biochemical conversion of plant-based insoluble carbohydrate polymers, such as starch from corn grains or cellulose-hemicellulose from corn stover, into soluble fermentable sugars (e.g., glucose and xylose) for bioenergy production has seen tremendous research activity and commercial-scale biorefineries deployment over the last three decades, particularly in regions around the world that have a dominant agricultural-based economy. Therefore, educators in schools and universities have developed various hands-on experimental activities to engage the general public and students either in outreach events or lab/classroom-based settings to instruct students on various inter-disciplinary concepts relevant to bioenergy and biochemicals production. One of the limitations of most available protocols is the lack of systematic and comprehensive comparison of educator-friendly analytical tools and protocols for quantitative analysis of water-soluble carbohydrates commonly encountered in a biorefinery backdrop during the biochemical conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to biofuels/biochemicals. Here, we systematically compare and validate findings from four leading analytical approaches for detection and quantification of lignocellulosic biomass derived soluble carbohydrates. We compare these assay methods based on the overall ease of use, detection accuracy/sensitivity, commercial availability, analytical cost per assay run, and suitability for use by instructors in biorefining specific hands-on activity protocols. Next, we provide a detailed instructional protocol that utilizes one of these validated soluble sugar assays as part of a ∼90 min hands-on bioenergy focused activity (called ‘Grass-to-Gas!’) conducted at Rutgers University with pre-university high school students. ‘Grass-to-Gas!’ activity involves students running biochemical assays that helps them understand the various facets of cellulosic biomass hydrolysis by commercial cellulase enzymes and monitoring the total glucose product released using our validated sugar assays to finally estimate the fractional conversion of cellulose-to-glucose. Lastly, we further demonstrate how such carbohydrate-based analytical methods can be used by instructors to help university students explore and understand various chemistry, biochemistry, and chemical engineering concepts relevant to other advanced operations involved in lignocellulose biorefining. These activity protocols would greatly aid educators teaching interdisciplinary science and engineering concepts to students in the backdrop of lignocellulose biorefining.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text"

A.",Jonathon Alexis Coates,2020-05-23,scientific communication and education,"The world continues to face a life-threatening viral pandemic. The virus underlying the COVID-19 disease, SARS-CoV-2, has caused over 98 million confirmed cases and 2.2 million deaths since January 2020. Although the most recent respiratory viral pandemic swept the globe only a decade ago, the way science operates and responds to current events has experienced a paradigm shift in the interim. The scientific community has responded rapidly to the COVID-19 pandemic, releasing over 125,000 COVID-19 related scientific articles within 10 months of the first confirmed case, of which more than 30,000 were hosted by preprint servers. We focused our analysis on bioRxiv and medRxiv, two growing preprint servers for biomedical research, investigating the attributes of COVID-19 preprints, their access and usage rates, as well as characteristics of their propagation on online platforms. Our data provides evidence for increased scientific and public engagement with preprints related to COVID-19 (COVID-19 preprints are accessed more, cited more, and shared more on various online platforms than non-COVID-19 preprints), as well as changes in the use of preprints by journalists and policymakers. We also find evidence for changes in preprinting and publishing behaviour: COVID-19 preprints are shorter and reviewed faster. Our results highlight the unprecedented role of preprints and preprint servers in the dissemination of COVID-19 science, and the impact of the pandemic on the scientific communication landscape."

This study aimed to develop and validate a questionnaire that can assess the individual’s perceived risk of developing four major NCDs. Exploratory sequential mixed methods design was used. Qualitative part developed the question items pool by conducting two expert panels while quantitative part validated the questionnaire using both exploratory (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Separate samples were used for EFA (n=150) and CFA (n=210). The participants were aged between 25-60 years of both sexes with no known history of NCDs. Face to face interview was conducted. Parallel analysis was done to decide the number of factors to be extracted. EFA was done using maximum likelihood method with Promax rotation to extract the underlying factors of perceived risk while CFA was done to assess the goodness of fit of proposed EFA Model using model fit indices. Based on literature search, 86-item questionnaire was firstly generated. During two expert panels, some overlapped items and items that did not represent the specific construct were removed. Experts made sure the content validity of developed 51-item questionnaire which was used to collect data from 360 participants. EFA revealed the five factors model with 22 high loading items which extracted 54% of total variance. CFA proved that hypothesized five factors model of 21-item questionnaire (one item was removed due to low loading) was satisfied with adequate psychometric properties and model fit indices (RMSEA=0.056, CFI=0.921, TLI=0.908, SRMR=0.063 &amp; χ2/df=1.66). Developed 21-item questionnaire was shown to be valid and reliable to assess the perceived risk of developing NCDs among Myanmar population.

Having people from all ages participate in measuring biodiversity where they live helps to create awareness. Recently, the use of environmental DNA (eDNA) for biodiversity surveys has gained momentum. Here, we test whether sampling eDNA and metabarcoding can be used for rapid urban biodiversity surveys for educational purposes.Materials &amp; Methods We sampled 2×1 L of water from each of 15 locations in the city of Trondheim, Norway, including a variety of freshwater, marine and brackish habitats. DNA was extracted, amplified in triplicate for the COI gene and sequenced. The obtained data were analysed on the novel mBRAVE platform, an online open access software and computing resource.Results The water samples were collected in two days by two people and the lab analysis was completed in five days by one person. Overall, we detected the presence of 501 taxa identified as belonging to 435 species, representing 90 orders and 18 phyla. On average, only 5.4% of the taxa were shared among six replicates per site. Based on the observed diversity, three distinct clusters were detected and related to geographic distribution of sites. There were some taxa shared between the habitats, with a substantial presence of terrestrial biota.Discussion Our results match expected patterns of biodiversity in the landscape and show that with minimal sampling effort, hundreds of species can be detected. Thus, using eDNA analysis of water is promising for rapid biodiversity surveys, and it is likely that more detailed results could be obtained by optimising field and lab methods for particular groups of interest. We recommend that rapid eDNA surveys, with openly available services and softwares, can be used to raise awareness in the importance of biodiversity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text"

The spike in research publications following the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak, however, has been like no other. The global crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic has mobilised scientific efforts in an unprecedented way. In less than five months, more than 12,000 research items have been indexed while the number increasing every day. With the crisis affecting all aspects of life, research on Covid-19 seems to have become a focal point of interest across many academic disciplines. Here, scientometric aspects of the Covid-19 literature are analysed and contrasted with those of the two previous major Coronavirus diseases, i.e. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). The focus is on the co-occurrence of key-terms, bibliographic coupling and citation relations of journals and collaborations between countries. Certain recurring patterns across all three literatures were discovered. All three outbreaks have commonly generated three distinct and major cohort of studies: (i) studies linked to the public health response and epidemic control, (ii) studies associated with the chemical constitution of the virus and (iii) studies related to treatment, vaccine and clinical care. While studies affiliated with the category (i) seem to have been the first to emerge, they overall received least numbers of citations compared to those of the two other categories. Covid-19 studies seem to have been distributed across a broader variety of journals and subject areas. Clear links are observed between the geographical origins of each outbreak or the local geographical severity of each outbreak and the magnitude of research originated from regions. Covid-19 studies also display the involvement of authors from a broader variety of countries compared to SARS and MRS.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text"

Turfgrass lawns cover a vast area in North America and provide a great opportunity for habitat restoration to native wildflowers by the general public. Efforts to encourage the public to replace lawns with wildflowers could be improved by a better understanding of the thoughts and opinions of the public about lawns. We conducted a nationwide online survey to understand what barriers are most important in preventing people from converting a 6 x 6 ft portion of turfgrass lawn to native wildflowers. We also collected data on a variety of demographic factors to see if those influence survey responses. Over 3200 people took survey across the US. We found that ‘Maintenance time’ and ‘Not knowing what to do’ were the most important barriers to creating wildflower habitat. Age was the most important demographic factor impacting results with young people significantly more likely to select multiple barriers in the survey. For example, people aged 18-34 were 4.3 times more likely to indicate ‘Maintenance cost’ would prevent them from creating a wildflower plot than those age 65 or older. Those who had already created a wildflower plot, or those who were members in a native plant or pollinator organization were less likely to select barriers across the board, except for external barriers related to homeowners associations, neighbors, and local governments. This shows that these are persistent concerns even for those that are otherwise keen to create wildflower habitat. Our results suggest that outreach promoting pollinator-friendly native plant gardens should focus on clear and simple methods, small plots that will not take too much time and less likely to provoke neighbors or authority figures.View Full Text"

R.",Rampalli Viswa Chandra,2020-06-03,scientific communication and education,"ABSTRACTBackground &amp; objectives The study had two aims. 1) Analysis of research projects done in our institution from 2014-2019 to identify products with a potential for commercialization and 2) To understand the effect of product-development variables on research projects to improve the quality of future commercialization-oriented trials.Methods 338 clinical trials were grouped into 188 projects under the headings irrigants, diagnostic devices, surgical devices, biomaterials and gels. Trials per project, capital, material costs, labour and the cycle times per trial were calculated. To understand the effect these variables, five hypotheses were generated to test whether greater number of trials, successes, higher capital, more investigators per trial and a longer trial duration will result in a product worthy of commercialization.Results 22 projects had products with a potential for commercialization. Except labour and cycle time (p&gt;0.05), all variables showed significant differences across all projects. Three products were identified as having potential for actual commercialization. It was observed that greater number of trials (χ2=4.6793; p=0.030528) and successes (χ2=20.8134; p&lt;0.00001) in a project along with a higher capital (χ2=12.2662; p=0.000461) will generate a product worthy of commercialization.Interpretation &amp; conclusions The results seem to suggest that in trials for commercialization, emphasis must be placed on implementing multiple, well-designed clinical trials on a device or product to successfully identify whether it is commercialization-worthy or not. Due attention must be given to the financial aspects of the projects as deficiencies may result in negative impact on the flow and outcomes of a clinical trial.Competing Interest StatementThis study is supported by a grant (DST/NSTMIS/05/222/2017-18) under the National Science &amp; Technology Management Information System (NSTMIS), Department of Science and Technology, Government of India.

P.",Alexander  Tilley,2020-06-03,scientific communication and education,"Small-scale fisheries are responsible for landing half of worlds fish catch, yet there are very sparse data on these fishing activities and associated fisheries production in time and space. Fisheries-dependent data underpin scientific guidance of management and conservation of fisheries systems, but it is inherently difficult to generate robust and comprehensive data for small-scale fisheries, particularly given their dispersed and diverse nature. In tackling this challenge, we use open source software components including the Shiny R package to build PeskAAS; an adaptable and scalable digital application that enables the collation, classification, analysis and visualisation of small-scale fisheries catch and effort data. We piloted and refined this system in Timor-Leste; a small island developing nation. The features that make PeskAAS fit-for-purpose are that it is: (i) fully open-source and free to use (ii) component-based, flexible and able to integrate vessel tracking data with catch records; (iii) able to perform spatial and temporal filtering of fishing productivity by fishing method and habitat; (iv) integrated with species-specific length-weight parameters from FishBase; (v) controlled through a click-button dashboard, that was co-designed with fisheries scientists and government managers, that enables easy to read data summaries and interpretation of context-specific fisheries data. With limited training and code adaptation, the PeskAAS workflow has been used as a framework on which to build and adapt systematic, standardised data collection for small-scale fisheries in other contexts. Automated analytics of these data can provide fishers, managers and researchers with insights into a fishers experience of fishing efforts, fisheries status, catch rates, economic efficiency and geographic preferences and limits that can potentially guide management and livelihood investments."

However, an overwhelming majority of brain research is carried out in the Global North, by a minority of well-funded and intimately interconnected labs. In contrast, with an estimated one neuroscientist per million people in Africa, news about neuroscience research from the Global South remains sparse. Clearly, devising new policies to boost Africa’s neuroscience landscape is imperative. However, the policy must be based on accurate data, which is largely lacking. Such data must reflect the extreme heterogeneity of research outputs across the continent’s 54 countries distributed over an area larger than USA, Europe and China combined. Here, we analysed all of Africa’s Neuroscience output over the past 21 years. Uniquely, we individually verified in each of 12,326 publications that the work was indeed performed in Africa and led by African-based researchers. This step is critical: previous estimates grossly inflated figures, because many of Africa’s high-visibility publications are in fact the result of internationally led collaborations, with most work done outside of Africa. The remaining number of African-led Neuroscience publications was 5,219, on average only ~5 per country and year. From here, we extracted metrics such as the journal and citations, as well as detailed information on funding, international collaborations and the techniques and model systems used. We link these metrics to demographic data and indicators of mobility and economy. For reference, we also extracted the same metrics from 220 randomly selected publications each from the UK, USA, Australia, Japan and Brazil. Our unique dataset allows us to gain accurate and in-depth information on the current state of African Neuroscience research, and to put it into a global context. This in turn allows us to make actionable recommendations on how African research might best be supported in the future.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text"

The majority of cervical cancer deaths occur in developing countries including Nepal. Though knowledge of cervical cancer is an important determinant of women’s participation in prevention and screening for cervical cancer, little is known about this topic in Nepal. This study explores the experiences of cervical cancer survivors and assesses the attitude of family and community towards it and stigma related to this disease in Bharatpur, Nepal.Methods The study design is qualitative methods involving two focus-group discussions. A total of 17 cervical cancer survivors were selected purposively from Chitwan. All qualitative data were transcribed and translated into English and were thematically analyzed.Results Majority of the participants had scant knowledge about cervical cancer, its causative agent, showed less cervical cancer screening, delayed healthcare-seeking behavior despite having persistent symptoms before the diagnosis. The main reasons identified for not uptaking the cervical screening methods are an embarrassment and having no symptoms at all. Most of them endured social stigma related to cervical cancer in the form of physical isolation and verbal abuse.Conclusions There is an urgent need for interventions to make women and the public aware of cervical cancer and launch effective health education campaigns, policies for cervical cancer prevention programs. This implementation can save the lives of hundreds of women and help them avoid going through all the negative experiences related to cervical cancer. More studies are required to gain the perspectives, knowledge, experiences, and attitudes of cervical cancer survivors to add to the research.View Full Text"

A sample consisted of 448 schoolchildren between 10 and 18 years old, who are assessed by body mass, height, BMI (waist circumference), triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-C, LDL-C, non-HDL cholesterol, fasting blood glucose and weekly physical activity time. The survey results showed a high prevalence of the HTW phenotype in schoolchildren (n = 125; 27.9%). The group diagnosed with phenotype has higher body mass, BMI, total cholesterol, LDL-C and non-HDL cholesterol and a lower level of HDL-C about the group without a diagnosis of the phenotype. However, for fasting blood glucose measurements and time of physical activity, the groups are no different. An association analysis using logistic regression showed the HTW phenotype associated with sex, nutritional status, and total cholesterol, where boys presented 2.0 (95% CI 1.3 - 3.2); obese 6.2 (95% CI 2.7 - 17.2) and cholesterol levels above 150 mg / dL 3.5 (95% CI 2.1 - 5.7) times more likely to have the phenotype. In this way, the present research showed a high prevalence of HTW in schoolchildren from public schools, with boys, obese and schoolchildren with total cholesterol levels, the individuals most likely to have the phenotype. However, it is worth emphasizing the importance of monitoring these variables throughout the year in all courses, given the period of strong, biological, behavioral and psychological changes, as they can quickly change the values of the analyzed variables."

M.",Franziska  Hartung,2020-06-09,scientific communication and education,"Behavioral evidence suggests that engaging with fiction is positively correlated with social abilities. The rationale behind this link is that engaging with fiction and fictional characters may offer a  training mode for mentalizing and empathizing with sentient agents in the real world, analogous to a flight simulator for pilots. In this study, we explored the relationship between reading fiction and mentalizing by looking at brain network dynamics in 57 participants who varied on how much fiction they read in their daily lives. The hypothesis was that if reading fiction indeed trains mentalizing, a task that requires mentalizing -Like immersing in a fictional story and engaging with a protagonist-should elicit differences in brain network dynamics depending on how much people read. More specifically, more frequent readers should show increased connectivity within the theory of mind network (ToM) or between the ToM network and other brain networks. While brain activation was measured with fMRI, participants listened to two literary narratives. We computed time-course correlations between brain regions and compared the correlation values from listening to narratives to listening to an auditory baseline condition. The between-region correlations were then related to individual differences measures including the amount of fiction that participants consume in their daily lives. Our results show that there is a linear relationship between how much people read and the functional connectivity in areas known to be involved in language and mentalizing. This adds neurobiological credibility to the  fiction influences mentalizing abilities hypothesis as suggested on the basis of conceptual analysis."

Indeed, it increases live birth rates among high responders and prevents preterm birth and small for gestational age. Consequently, why shouldnt we extend it to all?

Materials and methodsA retrospective and monocentric study was conducted between January 2008 and January 2018 comparing the cumulative live birth rates (CLBR) between patients having undergone FAS and a control group using fresh embryo transfer (FET) and having at least one frozen embryo available. Analyses were made for the entire cohort (population 1) and for different subgroups according to confounding factors selected by a logistic regression (population 3), and to the BELRAP (Belgian Register for Assisted Procreation) criteria (population 2).

Results2216 patients were divided into two groups: Freeze all (FA), 233 patients and control (C), 1983 patients. The CLBR was 50.2% vs 58.1% P=0.021 for population 1 and 53.2% vs 63.3% P=0.023 for population 2, including 124 cases and 1241 controls. The CLBR stayed in favour of the C group: 70.1% vs 55.9% P=0.03 even when confounding variables were excluded (FA and C group respectively 109 and 770 patients). The median time to become pregnant was equally in favour of the C group with a median of 5 days against 61 days.

ConclusionsCLBR is significantly lower in the FA group compared to the C group with a longer time to become pregnant. Nevertheless, the CLBR in the FA group remains excellent and superior to that observed in previous studies with similar procedures and population. These results confirm the high efficiency of FAS but underline the necessity to restrict the strategy to selected cases."

Many reports stress the importance of shortening the TTD, but provide no recommendations to achieve this goal. Herein, factors potentially affecting TTD are discussed and one mechanism that harmonizes undergraduate and graduate programs is proposed as a strategy to reduce the TTD."

Gooley,2020-06-12,scientific communication and education,"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in widespread closure of schools and universities. These institutions have turned to distance learning to provide educational continuity. Schools now face the challenge of how to reopen safely and resume in-class learning. However, there is little empirical evidence to guide decision-makers on how this can be achieved. Here, we show that selectively deploying e-learning for larger classes is highly effective at decreasing campus-wide opportunities for student-to-student contact, while allowing most in-class learning to continue uninterrupted. We conducted a natural experiment at a large university that implemented a series of e-learning interventions during the COVID-19 outbreak. Analyses of >24 million student connections to the university Wi-Fi network revealed that population size can be manipulated by e-learning in a targeted manner according to class size characteristics. Student mixing showed accelerated growth with population size according to a power law distribution. Therefore, a small e-learning dependent decrease in population size resulted in a large reduction in student clustering behaviour. Our results show that e-learning interventions can decrease potential for disease transmission while minimizing disruption to university operations. Universities should consider targeted e-learning a viable strategy for providing educational continuity during early or late stages of a disease outbreak."

Shortcuts through metadata analysis (e.g., keywords) assume that studies are properly tagged. However, machine learning approaches can rapidly survey the actual text of coronavirus abstracts to identify research overlap between COVID-19 and other coronavirus diseases, research hotspots, and areas warranting exploration. We propose a fast, scalable, and reusable framework to parse novel disease literature. When applied to the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset (CORD-19), dimensionality reduction suggested that COVID-19 studies to date are primarily clinical-, modeling- or field-based, in contrast to the vast quantity of laboratory-driven research for other (non-COVID-19) coronavirus diseases. Topic modeling also indicated that COVID-19 publications have thus far focused primarily on public health, outbreak reporting, clinical care, and testing for coronaviruses, as opposed to the more limited number focused on basic microbiology, including pathogenesis and transmission."

Science Solstice and  Summer Soil-stice are mycology citizen science projects aimed at assessing drug resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus fungal spores found in air and soil, respectively, in the United Kingdom (UK). A. fumigatus plays an important role in the environment as a decomposer of plant material, but is also an opportunistic human lung pathogen. Infection with drug-resistant spores can lead to a worse clinical outcome for the patient.

On the first four solstice and equinox days between June 2018 and June 2019, volunteers were asked to collect air samples from their homes and workplaces and return them to our lab in Freepost envelopes. An additional round of samples was requested from volunteers gardens and/or compost on the June 2019 solstice. In total, 787 volunteers returned 2,132 air samples and 509 soil samples, which grew a total of 7,991 A. fumigatus colonies. The estimated total cost of the study was {pound}2,650; the equivalent of 33 pence per A. fumigatus colony grown.

Incorporating citizen science into the environmental surveillance of drug-resistant A. fumigatus allowed for the simultaneous collection of hundreds of environmental samples across the entire UK on the same day. The insights generated from this study would not be practical in the absence of public participation and offers opportunities to ask scientific questions that were previously unaskable."

Although a negative trend in mean text sentiment was observed in 2015 for primates, an otherwise consistent positive mean sentiment text and emoji score through time was revealed in response to both exotic wild cat and primate videos, implying the societal normalisation and acceptance of exotic pets. These findings highlight the urgency for effective YouTube(R) policy changes and content management to promote public education and conservation awareness, whilst extinguishing false legitimisation and potential demand for the exotic pet trade."

Researchers' opinions on success indicators,"Aubert Bonn, N.; Pinxten, W.",Noémie  Aubert Bonn,2020-06-23,scientific communication and education,"The way in which we assess researchers has been under the radar in the past few years. Critics argue that current research assessments focus on productivity and that they increase unhealthy pressures on scientists. Yet, the precise ways in which assessments should change is still open for debate. We circulated a survey with Flemish researchers to understand how they work, and how they would rate the relevance of specific indicators used in research assessments. We found that most researchers worked far beyond their expected working schedule. We also found that, although they spent most of their time doing research, respondents wished they could dedicate more time to it and spend less time writing grants and performing other activities such as administrative duties and meetings. When looking at success indicators, we found that indicators related to openness, transparency, quality, and innovation were perceived as highly important in advancing science, but as relatively overlooked in career advancement. Conversely, indicators which denoted of prestige and competition were generally rated as important to career advancement, but irrelevant or even detrimental in advancing science. Open comments from respondents further revealed that, although indicators which indicate openness, transparency, and quality (e.g., publishing open access, publishing negative findings, sharing data, etc.) should ultimately be valued more in research assessments, the resources and support currently in place were insufficient to allow researchers to endorse such practices. In other words, current research assessments are inadequate and ignore practices which are essential in contributing to the advancement of science. Yet, before we change the way in which researchers are being assessed, supporting infrastructures must be put in place to ensure that researchers are able to commit to the activities that may benefit the advancement of science.

D.",Richard Kenneth Alistair White,2020-06-24,scientific communication and education,"We studied journal articles published by researchers at all eight of New Zealand universities in 2017 to determine how many were freely accessible on the web. We wrote software code to harvest data from multiple sources, code that we now share to enable others to reproduce our work on their own sample set. In May 2019, we ran our code to determine which of the 2017 articles were open at that time and by what method; where those articles would have incurred an Article Processing Charge (APC) we calculated the cost if those charges had been paid. Where articles were not freely available we determined whether the policies of publishers in each case would have allowed deposit in a non-commercial repository (Green open access). We also examined citation rates for different types of access. We found that, of our 2017 sample set, about two out of every five articles were freely accessible without payment or subscription (41%). Where research was explicitly said to be funded by New Zealands major research funding agencies, the proportion was slightly higher at 45%. Where open articles would have incurred an APC we estimated an average cost per article of USD1,682 (for publications where all articles require an APC, that is, Gold open access) and USD2,558 (where APC payment is optional, Hybrid open access) at a total estimated cost of USD1.45m. Of the paid options, Gold is by far more common for New Zealand researchers (82% Gold, 18% Hybrid). In terms of citations, our analysis aligned with previous studies that suggest a correlation between publications being freely accessible and, on balance, slightly higher rates of citation. This is not seen across all types of open access, however, with Diamond OA achieving the lowest rates. Where articles were not freely accessible we found that a very large majority of them (88% or 3089 publications) could have been legally deposited in an institutional repository. Similarly, only in a very small number of cases had a version deposited in the repository of a New Zealand university made the difference between the publication being freely accessible or not (125 publications). Given that most New Zealand researchers support research being open, there is clearly a large gap between belief and practice in New Zealands research ecosystem."

The adoption of open science principles at different levels of the scientific process (e.g., individual researchers, laboratories, institutions) has been rapidly changing the scientific research landscape in the past years, but uptake of these principles differ from discipline to discipline. Here, we asked to what extent journals in the field of sleep and chronobiology research encourage or even require following transparent and open science principles in their author guidelines. To this end, we scored the author guidelines of a comprehensive set of 28 sleep and chronobiology journals, including the major outlets in the field, using the standardised Transparency and Openness (TOP) Factor. This instrument rates the extent to which journals encourage or require following various aspects of open science, including data citation, data transparency, analysis code transparency, materials transparency, design and analysis guidelines, study pre-registration, analysis plan pre-registration, replication, registered reports, and the use of open science badges. Across the 28 journals, we find low values on the TOP Factor (median [25th, 75th percentile] 2.5 [1, 3], min. 0, max. 9, out of a total possible score of 28). This suggests an opportunity for sleep and chronobiology journals to further support the recent developments by implementing transparency and openness principles in their guidelines and making adherence to them mandatory."

While crucial, the precise identification of structures serving as evolutionary traits and systematic criteria is not per se a highly motivating task for students. Teaching this in a traditional teaching setting is quite challenging especially with a large crowd of students to be kept engaged. This is even more difficult if, as during the COVID-19 crisis, students are not allowed to access laboratories for hands-on observation on fresh specimens and sometimes restricted to short-range movements outside their home.

Here we present QuoVidi, a new open-source web platform for the organisation of large scale treasure hunts. The platform works as follows: students, organised in teams, receive a list of quests that contain morphologic, ecologic or systematic terms. They have to first understand the meaning of the quests, then go and find them in the environment. Once they find the organism corresponding to a quest, they upload a geotagged picture of their finding and submit this on the platform. The correctness of each submission is evaluated by the staff. During the COVID-19 lockdown, previously validated pictures were also submitted for evaluation to students that were locked in low-biodiversity areas. From a research perspective, the system enables the creation of large image databases by the students, similar to citizen-science projects.

Beside the enhanced motivation of students to learn the vocabulary and perform observations on self-found specimens, this system allows faculties to remotely follow and assess the work performed by large numbers of students. The interface is freely available, open-source and customizable. It can be used in other disciplines with adapted quests and we expect it to be of interest in many classroom settings."

We report the diversity of profiles scientists exhibit based on their contributorship and look into biases in their career trajectory. We use Bayesian networks to train a prediction model based on a dataset of 70,694 publications from PLoS journals representing 347,136 distinct authors and their associated contribution statements. This model is used to predict the contributions of 222,925 authors in 6,236,239 publications, and apply a robust archetypal analysis to profile scientists by career stage. We divide scientific careers into four stages: junior, early-career, mid-career and late-career. Three scientific archetypes are found throughout the four career stages: leader, specialized, and supporting. All three archetypes are encountered for the early- and mid-career stages, whereas for junior and late-career stages only two archetypes are found. Scientists assigned to the leader and specialized archetypes tend to have longer careers than researchers who belong to the supporting archetype. There is consistent gender bias at all stages: the majority of male scientists belong to the leader archetype, while the larger proportion of women belong to the specialized archetype, especially for early and mid-career researchers."

L.; Senzanje, A.; Mabhaudhi, T.",Tinashe  Lindel  Dirwai,2020-07-02,scientific communication and education,"We investigated the conceptual capability of Moistube irrigation to discharge under zero applied positive pressure under varied climatic conditions by inducing an artificial evaporative demand (Ed) or negative pressure around moistube tubing. This was premised on the null hypothesis that an artificially induced Ed or negative pressure does not impact moistube discharge. Moistube tubing was enclosed in a 1 m long PVC conduit. A 20 l water reservoir placed on an electronic balance provided a continuous supply of water whilst a three-speed hot air blower facilitated the radiative factor and advection process. The procedure was conducted under varied climatic conditions of air velocities (ua) 1.2 m.s-1, 2.5 m.s-1, and 3.0 m.s-1 and the experiment run times were 159 h, 134 h and 10 h, respectively. The average temperature (Tave) and relative humidity (RH) data for ua = 1.2 m.s-1 were 53{degrees}C and 7.31%, whilst for ua = 2.5 m.s-1, Tave was 56{degrees}C and RH = 7.19%, and for ua = 3.0 m.s-1, Tave was 63{degrees}C and RH = 6.16%. The experimental data was input into the four variable Penman-Monteith method to compute the evaporative demand (Ed). For each of the air velocities, the respective Ed values obtained were 0.16, 0.31 and 0.36 mm.d-1. The Bowen ratios (r) were well below 1 (r < 1), which suggested a sufficient supply of moisture to evaporate. For Ed = 0.16 mm.d-1 the vapour pressure deficit (VPD) was 113.08 mbars, whilst for Ed = 0.31 mm.d-1 and for Ed = 0.36 mm.d-1 the VPD were 129.93 mbars and 150.14 mbars, respectively. The recorded discharges (q) at t = 10 hrs for Ed= 0.16 mm.d-1 was 7.67*10-3 l.hr-1.m-1, whilst for Ed = 0.31 mm.d-1 q = 14.5*10-3 l.hr-1.m-1, and for Ed = 0.36 mm.d-1 q = 20.8*10-3 l.hr-1.m-1. The imposed negative pressure causes an exponential increase in moistube discharge, thus disproving the null hypothesis. The higher the evaporative demand the higher the discharge. This phenomenon allows moistube irrigation to be used for deficit irrigation purposes and allows irrigators to capitalize on realistic soil matric potential irrigation scheduling approach."

J.; Pirlo, J.; Abramowitz, B.; Killingsworth, S.; Ziegler, M.",Bruce J MacFadden,2020-07-03,scientific communication and education,"The extensive sedimentary sequence of Florida preserves evidence of prehistoric life spanning some 40 million years into the past. This paper describes the results of a three-pronged professional development (PD) program conducted in November 2019 in which Florida teachers from eight counties gained knowledge and experience about the process and content of paleontology at an active field research site in northern Florida. Working alongside scientists, 15 elementary, middle, and high school teachers collected 5-million-year-old fossil vertebrates and made scientifically important discoveries that advance understanding of Floridas prehistoric life. The PD included three components: (1) a pre-trip webinar; (2) a morning tour of our museum exhibits to scaffold teachers understanding of the kinds of fossils they would find; and (3) the actual day-long field experience collecting fossils. A post-PD evaluation revealed gains in knowledge about, and experience with, fossils and paleontology. We also found that overall satisfaction with the PD underscored the importance of each of the three components supporting one-another--resulting in a more informative and rewarding learning experience for the participants. Fossils and the science of paleontology are a gateway for STEM learning and this subject and its extensions are applicable to existing standards in earth and life sciences at many grade levels."

Female authors are facing a decrease in papers submission rates since the beginning of the pandemic period. The reasons for this decline in women productivity need to be further investigated. Here we show the influence of gender, parenthood and race in academics productivity during the pandemic period, based on a survey answered by 3,345 Brazilian academics from various knowledge areas and research institutions. Findings revealed that male academics - especially childless ones - were the least affected group, whereas female academics, especially Black women and mothers, were the most impacted group. This scenario will leave long-term effects on the career progression of the most affected groups. The results presented here are crucial for the development of actions and policies that aim to avoid further deepening the gender gap in science. This particular situation we are facing during the pandemic demands institutional flexibility and academia should foster the discussion about actions to benefit Black scientists and academics with families in the post-pandemic scenario."

Since this system uses a complicated suit of criteria (differing among subject areas) to group journals into discrete categories, it could potentially create incentives to publish in low-impact journals ranked highly by QUALIS. Here I assess the influence of the QUALIS journal ranking system on the global impact of Brazilian science. Brazil shows a steeper decrease in the number of citations per document since the implementation of this QUALIS system, compared to the top Latin American countries publishing more scientific articles. All subject areas showed some degree of bias, with social sciences being usually more biased than natural sciences. Lastly, the decrease in the number of citations over time proved steeper in a more biased subject area, suggesting a faster shift towards low-impact journals. Overall, the findings documented here suggest that the QUALIS system has undermined the global impact of Brazilian science, and reinforce a recent recommendation from an official committee evaluating graduate programs to eliminate QUALIS. A system based on impact metrics could avoid introducing distorted incentives, and thereby boost the global impact of Brazilian science."

The Quality of Life (QOL) assessment is an important way to have a global view of the patient.

ObjectiveTo assess the QoL of people who seek acupuncture at the outpatient clinic of an acupuncture school.

MethodsQOL assessment using WHOQOL-BREF applied only once to people who voluntarily sought for acupuncture at the general outpatient clinic of Faculdade EBRAMEC in 2016.

ResultsPeople who sought for acupuncture treatment presented lower mean QoL value in all domains compared to normative values for Brazil, with physical domain presenting lower values than the other domains. It was also observed that male patients had higher values in the physical, psychological domains and general QOL compared to women.

ConclusionOur data demonstrated that people seeking for acupuncture treatment presented lower values of QOL in comparison to a referential study with a Brazilian population, providing for the first time reference values measured by WHOQOL-bref, for patients seeking for acupuncture in the city of Sao Paulo."

Srougi,2020-07-09,scientific communication and education,"Growing evidence suggests that students self-beliefs about the ability to alter their academic abilities can directly influence long-term achievement. These self-beliefs or mindsets can either be fixed (unchangeable) or growth oriented. Students with growth mindsets believe their academic abilities can change, which leads to higher grades and academic persistence in contrast to students with fixed mindsets. However, less is known about how these attributes affect student learning, particularly in college level biochemistry courses. In this study, we utilized social-psychological interventions to promote growth mindset among third and fourth year undergraduate students enrolled in a one semester Biochemistry survey course. Using a mixed-methods study design we evaluated student mindset, attitudes towards learning, and academic performance over four semesters. Our results suggest that although students mindsets did not change as a result of metacognitive interventions, their positive perceptions about learning vs performance did increase. Furthermore, students receiving growth mindset interventions significantly outperformed students who did not receive interventions on the final cumulative exam that assessed critical thinking skills. These results suggest that metacognitive interventions can be an effective tool to improve student academic performance in a biochemistry course."

Seiple,Ian B Seiple,2020-07-08,scientific communication and education,"The gender gap in chemistry has been the topic of much debate, with many perspectives stating that the field has improved, and outdated sexist views are behind us. While these views are common, we wanted to assess the accuracy of these comments from a data-driven perspective. In this study, we use PubMed to obtain the names of first and last authors for every paper published since 2005 across 15 journals. Each name was cross-referenced with a name-based gender API to give a predicted binary gender and a confidence score based on population data. We show that historically there has been an extensive overrepresentation of men in both first and corresponding authorship, and that there is no strong trend towards parity since 2005. We demonstrate that papers with female corresponding authors have more equitable gender representation of first authors. Finally, we find that there is significant variability among journals in the gender make-up of their editorial boards. We hope this analysis spurs creative discussions on how we can improve equitable gender representation in chemistry publications."

The study analysed the IWRM strategy advances and practical implications it had, since inception on effective water management in East, West and Southern Africa.

MethodsThe study adopted the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) and the scoping literature review approach. The study searched selected databases for peer-reviewed articles, books, and grey literature. DistillerSR software was used for article screening. A constructionist thematic analysis was employed to extract recurring themes amongst the regions.

ResultsThe systematic literature review detailed the adoption, policy revisions and growing/emerging policy trends and issues (or considerations) on IWRM in East, West and Southern Africa. Thematic analysis derived four cross-cutting themes that contributed to IWRM strategy implementation and adoption. The identified four themes were donor effect, water scarcity, transboundary water resources, and policy approach. The output further posited questions on the prospects, including whether IWRM has been a success or failure with the African water resource management fraternity.

M.; Tupps, C.; Kabir, A.",Rubina  Imtiaz,2020-07-20,scientific communication and education,"IntroductionIn 2008, Bangladesh initiated Preventive Chemotherapy (PCT) for school-age children (SAC) through bi-annual school-based mass drug administration (MDA) to control Soil-Transmitted Helminth (STH) infections. In 2016, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfares Program on Lymphatic Filariasis Elimination and STH (ELFSTH) initiated district-level community impact assessments with Children Without Worms (CWW) using standardized, population-based sampling to measure the post-intervention STH burden across all ages ([&ge;] 1 yr) for the three STH species.

Methods & Principal FindingsThe Integrated Community-based Survey for Program Monitoring (ICSPM) was developed by CWW and was used to survey 12 districts in Bangladesh from 2017 - 2020. We combined the individual demographic and parasite-specific characteristics from 10 districts and linked them with the laboratory data for collective analysis. Our analysis identified district-specific epidemiologic findings, important for program decisions.

Of the 17,874 enrolled individuals, 10,824 (61%) provided stool samples. Overall, the prevalence of any STH species was substantially reduced to 14% from 79.8% in 2005. The impact was similar across all ages. STH prevalence was below 10% in 10 districts collectively, but remained high in 4 districts, despite their high reported PCT coverage in previous years. Among all, Bhola district was unique because it was the only district with high Trichuris prevalence.

ConclusionBangladesh successfully lowered STH prevalence across all ages despite targeting SAC only. Data from the survey indicate significant number of adults and pre-school age children (PSAC) were self-deworming with purchased pills. This may account for the flat impact curve across all ages. Overall prevalence varied across surveyed districts, with persistent high transmission in the northeastern districts and a district in the central flood zone, indicating possible service and ecological factors. Discrepancies in the impact between districts highlight the need for district-level data to evaluate program implementation after consistent high PCT coverage.

Authors SummaryBangladesh government conducted school-based mass drug administration (MDA) for over 10 years to control soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections. School-based evaluations of MDA indicate a reduction in STH burden among school-aged children (SAC). To further assess the impact on the community, Children Without Worms and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfares Program on Lymphatic Filariasis Elimination and STH (ELFSTH) initiated district-level community impact surveys in 12 districts. We share the results from the latter 10 districts here.

Our analysis of 10,824 interviews and stool samples from 10 districts showed an estimated 14% of community members infected with at least one species of STH. This finding is substantially lower than the baseline STH prevalence (79.8%) estimated in 2005. Bangladeshs successful impact was achieved across all ages despite only treating SAC. Deworming source data showed significant numbers of adults and pre-school age children (PSAC) self-dewormed with locally purchased pills. Prevalence varied across the surveyed districts, with persistent high transmission in the northeastern districts and a district in the central flood zone, indicating possible ecological and service factors contributing to persistent infections. Discrepancies in the impact across districts highlights the need for sub-national level data to evaluate program performance fllowing consistent high intervention."
10.1101/2020.07.21.214288,The untapped potential of conservation journals to promote freshwater biodiversity,"He, F.; Jaehnig, S. C.; Wetzig, A.; Langhans, S. D.",Fengzhi  He,2020-07-22,scientific communication and education,"Freshwater ecosystems are amongst the most diverse ecosystems on the planet. They are subject to intense and increasing threats and have a higher proportion of threatened and extinct species than terrestrial or marine realms. Concurrently, freshwater ecosystems are largely underrepresented in both conservation research and actions arguably as a consequence of less popularity and promotion. To test this assumption, we used cover images as a proxy of exposure and promotion opportunities provided by conservation journals. We collected information on cover images of 18 conservation journals from 1997 to 2016 and data on citations and Altmetric scores of papers published in them. We found that freshwater ecosystems (10.4%) were featured less often than marine (15.2%) or terrestrial (74.4%) ecosystems on covers of these journals. All 15 most featured species are from terrestrial or marine ecosystems, with 14 of them being large vertebrates such as elephants, big cats, rhinos, polar bears, and marine turtles. None of the 95 species featured more than once on the covers of conservation journals spend their whole life history in fresh waters, i.e. they are at least partly associated with terrestrial or marine ecosystems. Our results indicated that cover-featured studies received more attention from academia and the general public, i.e. showed higher citations and Altmetric scores, than non-featured ones within the same issue. By featuring freshwater species and habitats on covers, therewith providing more exposure opportunities, conservation journals hold the potential to promote biodiversity conservation in fresh waters. Scientists can help that endeavour by submitting freshwater-related photos together with their manuscripts for review, therewith providing more options for editors to portray freshwater species and habitats and to ultimately raise awareness and appreciation of freshwater life."

I.; Marret, M.; Chinna, K.",Siew Yim  Loh,2020-07-22,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundSensory processing difficulties and participation in childhood occupation in children impact their development, but the association among Malaysian children is unknown. The aim of this study is to provide empirical evidences on sensory processing and participation in childhood occupation, in children with autism and compare them with typical children without autism /typical.

MethodTwo groups of participants (parents of children with autism and parents of  normal children were recruited from 5 hospitals, and from tuition/care centre/school respectively. Children with autism, age 6 to 10 years were matched (age/gender) with  typical children. The Participation of childhood occupation (PICO) and Sensory Processing (SSP) measures were used. Data were analysed descriptively for patterns, and Chi-square cross tabs used to compare sensory processing and participation (categorical variables) between the two groups.

Results186 parents (93 children with autism and 93 typically developing children) participated. In the autism group, 77.4 percent (n=72) were males, or 4:1 male to female ratio. Children with autism compared with typical group experienced- a) higher sensory processing difficulties and b) less participation in childhood occupation (except basic activities like eating and sleep). Sensory processing difficulties in the autism children is lower compared to developed countries, but, the prevalence of sensory processing difficulties in the  typical children (21.5 percent) was higher than data from USA and Israel (9-15%). There were significant differences in sensory processing difficulties between the two group (p<0.05), except for movement sensitivity (p=0.28). Auditory filtering section were most affected in children with autism.

ConclusionDifferences were found in the sensory processing difficulties (especially auditory filtering) and lower participation in autism group compared to  normal group. A higher percentage of sensory processing difficulties was also found in the  normal/ typically developing children, which may be attributed to cultural or geographical factors (living in high rise flats with less playing space). More studies are needed comparing rural and urban children."

To date, there is lack of studies describing clinical characteristics of the population most at risk of infection. Hence, we aimed to identify clinical predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection risk and to develop and validate a score predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection risk comparing it with unspecific surrogates.

MethodsRetrospective case/control study using administrative health-related database was carried out in Southern Italy (Campania region) among beneficiaries of Regional Health Service aged over than 30 years. For each subject with Covid-19 confirmed diagnosis (case), up to five controls were randomly matched for gender, age and municipality of residence. Odds ratios and 90% confidence intervals for associations between candidate predictors and risk of infection were estimated by means of conditional logistic regression. SARS-CoV-2 Infection Score (SIS), was developed by generating a total aggregate score obtained from assignment of a weight at each selected covariate using coefficients estimated from the model. Finally, the score was categorized by assigning increasing values from 1 to 4. SIS was validated by comparison with specific and unspecific predictors of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

ResultsSubjects suffering from diabetes, anaemias, Parkinsons disease, mental disorders, cardiovascular and inflammatory bowel and kidney diseases showed increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Similar estimates were recorded for men and women and younger and older than 65 years. Fifteen conditions significantly contributed to the SIS. As SIS value increases, risk progressively increases, being odds of SARS-CoV-2 infection among people with the highest SIS value (SIS=4), 1.74 times higher than those unaffected by any SIS contributing conditions (SIS=1).

ConclusionThis study identified conditions and diseases making individuals more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results are a decision-maker support tool for identifying population most at risk allowing adoption of preventive measures to minimize a potential new relapse damage."

C.; Boonyapatkul, P.",Thananda  Trakarnvanich,2020-07-23,scientific communication and education,"Filter facepiece respirators (FFRs) are critical for preventing the transmission of respiratory tract infection disease, especially the dreadful coronavirus 2 (SARs-CoV-2). The N95 mask is a prototype, high-efficiency protective device that can effectively protect against airborne pathogens of less than 0.3 m. The N95 mask is tightly fitting and has high filtration capacity. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has led to a greater requirement for FFR. This rising demand greatly exceeds current production capabilities and stockpiles, resulting in shortages. To address this, our team has invented a new type of half-piece respirator made from silicone and assembled with HEPA or elastostatic filter. A variety of methods have been used to evaluate this new device, including a qualitative fit test with the Bitrex(R) test kit and filtration test. The preliminary results showed that the new N99 respirators pass the fit test. The filtration tests also confirmed the superiority of N99 over traditional N95 masks, with a mean performance of protection greater than 95%. For the filters, we used two types: SafeStar, which is a kind of HEPA filter; and CareStar, which is considered an elastostatic filler. CareStar was developed to filter virus and bacteria in the operating room, with a limit duration of use up to 24 h, while the safe star was designed for 72 h use and has the quality equivalent to a HEPA filter. Our study demonstrated superior filtration efficacy of both filters, more than 98% even after 24 h of use. CareStar has significantly more filtration efficacy than a safe star (p < 0.001). In conclusion, the development of our new N99 half-piece respirator should ultimately be applicable to healthcare workers with at least non-inferiority to the previously used N 95 respirators.. Currently, the adequate supply of such equipment is not feasible. The advent of the new protective device will help protect healthcare workers and replenish the shortage of N95 respirators during the COVID-19 pandemic."

R.",Lauren A Maggio,2020-07-24,scientific communication and education,"PurposeThe purpose of this study was to characterize the extent, range, and nature of scoping reviews published in core medical education journals. In so doing, the authors identify areas for improvement in the conduct and reporting of scoping reviews, and highlight opportunities for future research.

MethodThe authors searched PubMed for scoping reviews published between 1999 through April 2020 in 14 medical education journals. From each review, the authors extracted and summarized key bibliometric data, the rationales given for conducting a scoping review, the research questions, and key reporting elements as described in the PRISMA-ScR reporting guidelines. Rationales and research questions were mapped to the reasons for conducting a scoping review, as described by Arksey and OMalley.

ResultsOne hundred and one scoping reviews were included. On average 10.1 scoping reviews (MED=4, SD=13.08) were published annually with the most reviews published in 2019 (n=42) in 13 of the included 14 journals reviewed. Academic Medicine published the most scoping reviews (n=28) overall. Authors described multiple reasons for undertaking scoping reviews, including to: summarize and disseminate research findings (n=77); examine the extent, range, and nature of research activity in a given area (n=74); and to analyze an emerging topic or heterogenous literature base (n=46). In 11 reviews there was alignment between the rationales for the scoping review and the stated research questions. No review addressed all elements of the PRISMA-ScR, with only a minority of authors publishing a protocol (n=2) or including stakeholders (n=20). Authors identified several shortcomings of scoping review methodology, including being unable to critically assess the included studies.

ConclusionsMedical educators are increasingly conducting scoping reviews with a desire to characterize the literature on a topic. There is room for improvement in the reporting of scoping reviews, including the alignment of research questions, the creation and publishing of protocols, and the inclusion of external stakeholders in published works."

A.; Abban-Baidoo, E.; Marschner, B.",Kwame  Agyei  Frimpong,2020-07-24,scientific communication and education,"Soil fertility decline represents a major constraint to crop productivity in sub-Saharan Africa. Many studies have shown that addition of biochar or compost can effectively improve soil quality. Biochar produced from crop residues are often N-poor but rich in stable C while poultry manure composts, which is often rich in nutrients including N decomposes rapidly under high rainfall and temperature conditions. Combined biochar and compost application can compensate for the shortcomings of each other such that their interactive effect is likely to improve soil quality. A 30-days incubation experiment was carried out on a Haplic acrisol amended with corn cob biochar, rice husk biochar, coconut husk biochar, poultry manure compost and composted rice husk or corn cob biochar to examine the effect of compost and biochar, applied singly, in combination or as co-compost on basal soil respiration, and soil quality indicators such as soil pH; soil microbial carbon; cation exchange capacity; total organic carbon, total nitrogen and available nitrogen concentration. The results showed that addition of the different amendments increased soil pH compared with the untreated control with the combined corn cob and rice biochar and compost treatments recording the highest pH values. Basal respiration following sole compost, composted biochar and combined biochar and compost application were significantly greater than the sole biochar and the control treatments. TOC increased by 37% in the sole compost treatment to 117.3% in the combined corn cob biochar and compost treatment, respectively. MBC increased by 132.2% in the combined rice husk biochar and compost treatment and by 247% in the sole compost treatment compared to the control. The study has demonstrated the potential of compost, biochar and especially composted biochar to enhance soil quality, C stabilization and reduce soil C loss through basal respiration."

Y.; Hallam, S. J.",Steven J Hallam,2020-07-26,scientific communication and education,"We live in an increasingly data-driven world, where high-throughput sequencing and mass spectrometry platforms are transforming biology into an information science. This has shifted major challenges in biological research from data generation and processing to interpretation and knowledge translation. However, post-secondary training in bioinformatics, or more generally data science for life scientists, lags behind current demand. In particular, development of accessible, undergraduate data science curricula has potential to improve research and learning outcomes and better prepare students in the life sciences to thrive in public and private sector careers. Here, we describe the Experiential Data science for Undergraduate Cross-Disciplinary Education (EDUCE) initiative, which aims to progressively build data science competency across several years of integrated practice. Through EDUCE, students complete data science modules integrated into required and elective courses augmented with coordinated co-curricular activities. The EDUCE initiative draws on a community of practice consisting of teaching assistants, postdocs, instructors and research faculty from multiple disciplines to overcome several reported barriers to data science for life scientists, including instructor capacity, student prior knowledge, and relevance to discipline-specific problems. Preliminary survey results indicate that even a single module improves student self-reported interest and/or experience in bioinformatics and computer science. Thus, EDUCE provides a flexible and extensible active learning framework for integration of data science curriculum into undergraduate courses and programs across the life sciences.

The transition to online examinations, with the concomitant exposure of previously tried-and-tested MCQs, exacerbates the challenges of question production, and highlights the need for innovative solutions.

Several groups have shown that it is practical to leverage the student cohort to produce a very large number of syllabus-aligned MCQs for study banks. Although student-generated questions are well suited for formative feedback and practice activities, they are generally not thought to be suitable for high-stakes assessments. In this study, we aimed to demonstrate that training can be provided to students in a scalable fashion to generate questions of similar quality to those produced by experts, and that identification of suitable questions can be achieved with minimal academic review and editing.

Biochemistry and Molecular Biology students were assigned a series of activities designed to coach them in the art of writing and critiquing MCQs. This training resulted in the production of over one thousand MCQs that were then gauged for potential by either expert academic judgement, or via a data-driven approach in which the questions were trialled objectively in a low-stakes test. Questions selected by either method were then deployed in a high-stakes in-semester assessment alongside questions from two academically authored sources: textbook-derived MCQs, and past paper questions.

A total of 120 MCQs from these four sources were deployed in assessments attempted by over 600 students. Each question was subjected to rigorous performance analysis, including the calculation of standard metrics from classical test theory and more sophisticated Item Response Theory (IRT) measures. The results showed that MCQs authored by students and selected at low cost performed as well as questions authored by academics, illustrating the potential of this strategy for the efficient creation of large numbers of high quality MCQs for summative assessment."

C.; Pandey, A.",Tulsi  Ram  Gompo,2020-07-29,scientific communication and education,"Nepal has an agrarian-based economy where the livestock sector contributes about 12 percent to the national GDP. Rupandehi district is one of the largest dairy pocket areas in the nation, but the disease, such as leptospirosis, posed a negative impact on their production and productivity. Despite the economic importance of cattle leptospirosis, the disease is concerned for the peoples occupational risk and food safety. Although leptospirosis is a priority zoonosis in Nepal, the effective implementation of the control program lacks both in animal and human health. A cross-sectional study was conducted to estimate the prevalence and identify associated risk factors of cattle leptospirosis from March 2019 to April 2020. Altogether, 206 cattle herds located in all the sixteen local levels of the district were visited. The owners were interviewed to record the cattle management systems information and their knowledge of the zoonotic diseases. A total of 383 cattle serum samples were collected, and an indirect antibody ELISA was performed to estimate the infection status of leptospirosis in the cattle herds. All the data were analyzed by Open epi and R software for the descriptive and analytical study. Bivariate and multivariable logistic regression was applied to assess the potential herd level and animal level risk factors. Out of seven potential herd-level risk factors, the purchased cattle herds (OR: 7.2, 95% CI: 1.24-136.5, p=0.025) and cattle with herd size >10 (OR: 14.92, 95% CI: 2.61-283.38, p=0.025) were identified as significant risk factors for leptospirosis. At the animal level, the cattle taken for grazing in pastureland accessed by the community dog was a significant risk factor (OR: 4.16, 95% CI: 1.13-14.06, p=0.034). Surprisingly, none of the farmers had heard about leptospirosis before. The outcome of this research could be an epidemiological insight in control of priority zoonosis to protect the livestock economy and reduce their negative impact on public health."

Compared to Japan, the knowledge and anxiety level and the frequency of precautionary behaviors were higher in the UK and Spain. Participants with infected acquaintances were more concerned about COVID-19. However, participants in the UK rarely wore a medical mask. Participants in the UK and Spain were eager to get information about COVID-19 compared to those in Japan. The participants in Spain tended not to trust official information and to believe specialists' comments instead. The urgency of the spread of COVID-19, cultural backgrounds, and recent political situations appear to contribute to the differences among countries revealed herein."

To test this notion, we performed an experiment in which we asked undergraduate students to analyze a fictitious dataset. In addition to being asked what they could conclude from the dataset, half of the students were asked to also test specific hypotheses. In line with our notion, students in the hypothesis-free group were almost 5 times more likely to observe an image of a gorilla when simply plotting the data, a proxy for an initial step towards data analysis. If these findings are representative also of scientific research as a whole, they warrant concern about the current emphasis on hypothesis-driven research, especially in the context of information-rich datasets such as those now routinely created in the biological sciences. Our work provides evidence for a link between the psychological effect of selective attention and hypothesis-driven data analysis, and suggests a hidden cost to having a hypothesis when analyzing a dataset."

Little efforts have been made on engaging students in computational development after programming trainings. An emerging need is to establish subjects of bioinformatics and programming languages in genetics and molecular biology graduate programs, when students in these degree programs are immersed in a sea of genomic and transcriptomic data, which demands proficient computational treatment. I report an empirical guideline to introduce programming languages and recommend Python as first language for graduate programs in which students were from genetics and molecular biology backgrounds. Including the development of programming solutions related to graduate students' research activities may improve programming skills and better engagement. These results suggest that the applied approach leads to enhanced learning of introductory to autonomy in highly advanced programming concepts by graduate students. This guide should be extended for other research programs."

A class was randomly selected in four school grades (1-4) along with 30 students from each to take the Test of Gross Motor Development-2 (TGMD-2). A total of 117 children (42 girls, aged 7-10) participated in three tests: TGMD-2, MF tests, and FMS. MF levels (good, fair, and poor) and FMS levels (high, moderate, and low) were classified according to specific percentile ranges. A multiple (RxC) chi-square test analysis of the relationship between MF, FMS, and FMS was applied and post hoc testing estimated the possibility of FMS and FMS predicting MF. The results showed that only 43% of children were rated ""good"" on MF. Most fourth-grade students exhibited a certain gap with mature FMS (TGMD-2 score 70.13{+/-}9.68< 96 full scores). Boys scored significantly higher on the object control subtest and the TGMD-2 total score compared to girls (p<0.001), while girls had a significantly greater score than boys on the FMS (p=0.001). The results of multiple chi-square demonstrated FMS to be weakly correlated with MF, {chi}2 (4,N=117) =14.605, p =0.006< 0.01, Cramers V = 0.25. Both 60.5% of ""excellent"" FMS and 59.6% of ""high"" FMS children were categorized as having a ""good"" MF level. On the other hand, only 23.1% of the ""worst"" FMS and 24.3% of ""low"" FMS individuals were classified as having a ""good"" MF level. Our results suggest that MF, FMS, FMS are relatively independent systems linking with each other, generating mutual interaction in childrens motor development. At different stages or different advantages of them motor development, we may emphasize training one or a few parts."

MethodsThe PubMed, Elsevier, and Research Gate (RG) databases were under consideration in this study over a specific time. Analyses were carried out on the number of publications as (a) function of time (day), (b) journals and (c) authors. Doubling time of the number of publications was analyzed for PubMed ""all articles"" and Elsevier published articles. Analyzed databases were (1A) PubMed ""all articles"" (01/12/2019-12/06/2020) (1B) PubMed Review articles (01/12/2019-2/5/2020) and (1C) PubMed Clinical Trials (01/01/2020-30/06/2020) (2) Elsevier all publications (01/12/2019-25/05/2020) (3) RG (Article, Pre Print, Technical Report) (15/04/2020-30/4/2020).

FindingsTotal publications in the observation period for PubMed, Elsevier, and RG were 23000, 5898 and 5393 respectively. The average number of publications/day for PubMed, Elsevier and RG were 70.0 {+/-}128.6, 77.6{+/-}125.3 and 255.6{+/-}205.8 respectively. PubMed shows an avalanche in the number of publication around May 10, number of publications jumped from 6.0{+/-}8.4/day to 282.5{+/-}110.3/day. The average doubling time for PubMed, Elsevier, and RG was 10.3{+/-}4 days, 20.6 days, and 2.3{+/-}2.0 days respectively. In PubMed average articles/journal was 5.2{+/-}10.3 and top 20 authors representing 935 articles are of Chinese descent. The average number of publications per author for PubMed, Elsevier, and RG was 1.2{+/-}1.4, 1.3{+/-}0.9, and 1.1{+/-}0.4 respectively.

We introduce a simplified bibliometric data analysis protocol for gaining substantial insights into research thematics, which can also serve as a handy practical skill for researchers, while working from home. In this paper, we provide ways of developing a holistic research strategy using bibliometric-data driven approaches that integrate network analysis and information management, without the need of full paper access. This protocol is a comprehensive multi-modular pathway for analysis of metadata obtained from major scientific publishing houses by use of a Decision Support System (DSS). A simple case study on the invasive species Lantana camara has been presented as a proof-of-concept to show how one can implement this DSS based protocol. Some perspectives are also provided on how the outcomes can be used directly or scaled up for long term research interventions. We hope that this work will simplify exploratory literature review, and enable rational design of research objectives for scholars, as well as development of comprehensive grant proposals that address gaps in research."

This study was conducted to analyze the impact of retraction on citations received by retracted papers in two-time frames: during a post-retraction period equivalent to the time the article had been in print before retraction; and during the total post-retraction period.

ResultsThe results indicated an increase in post-retraction citations when compared with citations received pre-retraction. There were some exceptions however: first, citations received by articles published in first-quartile journals decreased immediately after retraction (p<0.05), only to increase again after some time had elapsed; and second, post-retraction citations decreased significantly in the case of articles that had received many citations before their retraction (p<0.05).

ConclusionsThe results indicate that retraction of articles has no impact on citations in the long term, since the retracted articles continue to be cited, thus circumventing their retraction. More effective mechanisms should be established to prevent the citation of retracted articles in scientific papers.

MethodsQuasi-experimental, pre-post evaluation study. A total of 304 retracted original articles and literature reviews indexed in Medline fulfilled the exclusion criteria. Articles were required to have been published in Pubmed from January 2013 through December 2016 and been retracted between January 2014 and December 2016. The main outcome was the number of citations received before and after retraction. Results were broken down by journal quartile according to impact factor and the most cited papers (pre-retraction) were specifically analyzed."

D.; Georgescu, C.",Jonathan D Wren,2020-08-13,scientific communication and education,"Although citations are used as a quantifiable, objective metric of academic influence, cases have been documented whereby references were added to a paper solely to inflate the perceived influence of a body of research. This reference list manipulation (RLM) could take place during the peer-review process (e.g., coercive citation from editors or reviewers), or prior to it (e.g., a quid-pro-quo between authors). Surveys have estimated how many people may have been affected by coercive RLM at one time or another, but it is not known how many authors engage in RLM, nor to what degree. Examining a subset of active, highly published authors (n=20,803) in PubMed, we find the frequency of non-self citations (NSC) to one author coming from one paper approximates Zipfs law. We propose the Gini Index as a simple means of quantifying skew in this distribution and test it against a series of ""red flag"" metrics that are expected to result from RLM attempts. We estimate between 81 (FDR <0.05) and 231 (FDR<0.10) authors are outliers on the curve, suggestive of chronic, repeated RLM. Based upon the distribution, we estimate approximately 3,284 (16%) of all authors may have engaged in RLM to some degree, possibly opportunistically. Finally, we find authors who use 18% or more of their references for self-citation are significantly more likely to have NSC Gini distortions, suggesting their desire to see their work cited carries over into their peer-review activity."

D.; Jones, K.; Freeman, R.",Joseph W Millard,2020-08-20,scientific communication and education,"Threats to global biodiversity are well-known, but slowing currents rates of biodiversity loss remains an ongoing challenge. The Aichi Targets set out 20 goals on which the international community should act to alleviate biodiversity decline, one of which (Target 1) aimed to raise public awareness of the importance of biodiversity. Whilst conventional indicators for Target 1 are of low spatial and temporal coverage, conservation culturomics has demonstrated how biodiversity awareness can be quantified at the global scale. Following the Living Planet Index methodology, here we introduced the Species Awareness Index (SAI), an index of changing species awareness on Wikipedia. We calculated this index at the page level for 41,197 IUCN species across 10 Wikipedia languages, incorporating over 2 billion views. Bootstrapped indices for the page level SAI show that overall awareness of biodiversity is marginally increasing, although there are differences among taxonomic classes and languages. Among taxonomic classes, overall awareness of reptiles is increasing fastest, and amphibians slowest. Among languages, overall species awareness for the Japanese Wikipedias is increasing fastest, and the Chinese and German Wikipedias slowest. Although awareness of species on Wikipedia as a whole is increasing, and is significantly higher in traded species, over the period 2016-2020 change in interest appears not to be strongly related to the trade of species or animal pollinators. As a data source for public biodiversity awareness Wikipedia could be integrated into the Biodiversity Engagement Indicator, thereby incorporating a more direct link to biodiversity itself."

Fulvio,2020-08-20,scientific communication and education,"In the field of neuroscience, despite the fact that the proportion of peer-reviewed publications authored by women has increased in recent decades, the proportion of citations of women-led publications has not seen a commensurate increase: In five broad-scope journals, citations of papers first- and/or last-authored by women have been shown to be fewer than would be expected if gender was not a factor in citation decisions (Dworkin et al., 2020). Given the important implications that such underrepresentation may have on the careers of women researchers, it is important to determine whether this same trend is true in subdisciplines of the field, where interventions might be more effective. Here, we report the results of an extension of the analyses carried out by Dworkin et al. (2020) to citation patterns in the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience (JoCN). The results indicate that the underrepresentation of women-led publications in reference sections is also characteristic of papers published in JoCN over the past decade. Furthermore, this pattern of citation imbalances is present for all gender classes of authors, implicating systemic factors. These results contribute to the growing body of evidence that intentional action is needed to address inequities in the way that we carry out and communicate our science."

As our understanding of the world progresses, scientific disciplines naturally enrich their specialized vocabulary (jargon). However, in the era of interdisciplinarity, the use of jargon may hinder effective communication amongst scientists that do not share a common linguistic background. The question of how jargon limits the transmission of scientific knowledge has long been debated, but rarely addressed quantitatively. We explored the relationship between the use of jargon and citations using 21,486 articles focusing on cave research, a multidisciplinary field particularly prone to terminological specialization and where linguistic disagreement among peers is frequent. We demonstrate that the use of jargon in the title and abstract significantly reduces the number of citations a paper receives. Given that these elements are the hook to readers, we urge scientists to restrict jargon to sections of the paper where its use is unavoidable."

The increasing number of medical institutions and medical students attracts the challenge of inadequate facilitation of the teaching and learning processes. This warrants a study and/or an exploration of an alternative solution such as wooden models in order to solve the problem of scarce and ethically restricted human teaching aids.

Wooden pieces (50cm length x 20cm diameter) from a Jacaranda mimosifolia tree were prepared for the carving process and wooden replicas of human skulls were made. Two experimental groups of randomly selected medical students (60: Active and 60: Control) were separately taught using wooden and natural skull models respectively. The two groups were assessed and evaluated using the natural skull models to compare their understanding of the Anatomy of the skull. Additionally, opinion statements were collected from participants in the active group during the oral examination.

Six (6) wooden skull models were produced and used for experimental study. Comparisons of academic scores (mean and median) between Active (students using the wooden skull) and control (students using natural skull) groups showed no statistical significant difference (P [&ge;] 0.05). Concerning the enhancement of learning skills; the wooden model was constructed in a way that would be able to enhance learning as it would be the natural skull.

The wooden skull model, with more improvement in structural formation, can adequately facilitate the teaching and learning of anatomy of the Human skull.

This project and the experimental study about utilization of the wooden skull model provides a good potential of using the wooden models to supplement the use of the natural human skull."

Their renewal property offers exciting possibilities in reversing tissue damage caused by metabolic and degenerative changes. Research should be conducted increasingly to explore the possibilities of SC utilization in Pakistan.

ObjectivesTo assess the level of knowledge, perception, and attitude of medical students regarding stem cell research (SCR) and its application, to obtain a better insight into the future of stem cell therapy in Pakistan as it is a rapidly emerging field in medicine.

Materials and MethodsThis cross-sectional study was carried out using a self-administered questionnaire filled by 206 medical students from different medical colleges in Pakistan. A convenience sampling method was used. Knowledge and attitude scores were calculated based on answers to 28 well-structured questions. Data was analyzed using SPSS.

ResultsThe mean values of the answers showed that 60.2% (n=124) of the students had a good knowledge and 39.8% (n=82) had poor knowledge of stem cells. Whereas, 56.8% (n=117) expressed a positive attitude and 43.2% (n=89) expressed a negative attitude towards SCR. Independent t-test applied on knowledge score and attitude showed that the mean knowledge score of people with a positive attitude is higher i.e. 21.25 as compared to the mean knowledge score of people with negative attitude i.e. 19.21. And the difference of the means is significant at p=0.007. Thus, the attitude of students was observed to be significantly dependent on their knowledge about SCR.

ConclusionThe results show that medical students have baseline knowledge about SC therapy and a positive attitude towards it. Seminars, workshops should be conducted and this topic should be added to their syllabus so that they obtain proper information about SCR and encourage further research."

To identify the most important factors for research quality, we polled 253 CFs across Europe about their practices and analysed in detail the interaction process between CFs and their users, from the first contact to the publication of the results. Although the survey showed that CFs are dedicated to train and advise their users, it highlighted the following areas, the improvement of which would directly increase research quality: 1) motivating users to follow the advice and procedures for best research practice, 2) providing clear guidance on data management practices, 3) improving communication along the whole research process and 4) clearly defining the responsibilities of each party."

We aimed to assess RE education offerings of pharmacy master programs in Jordan and compare with the top-ranked pharmacy graduate programs globally. Therefore, a list of universities that offer research-based pharmacy master programs was created. Each program was evaluated for the inclusion of RE education. A qualitative content analysis approach based on inductive reasoning and latent analysis was followed to analyze the data. Results of the study showed a lack of appropriate RE education for graduate-level pharmacy programs in Jordan with only 40% of the programs partially discuss selected topics related to RE. Regarding pharmacy graduate programs globally, 10% offer a standalone RE course, 40% offer some discussions related to RE, another 10% do not offer RE education in any form, and the remaining 40% of the programs were difficult to assess due to lack of sufficient information available online. Based on the findings of this study, training in RE is tends to be lacking in pharmacy graduate programs in Jordan and globally, with a greater lack in Jordan than globally. There is a need to incorporate formal RE education into programs that do not offer this type of instruction. Programs that formally touch on some aspects of RE need to expand the scope of topics to include more RE-related themes. Integrating a standalone RE course into pharmacy graduate programs is highly encouraged."

International agreements such as the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) have committed to conserve and sustainably and equitably use all levels of biodiversity-genes, species and ecosystems-globally. However, assessment and monitoring of genetic diversity are often overlooked, and there are large knowledge and policy gaps regarding genetic diversity conservation. In this study, we present the first quantitative analysis of genetic diversity assessments conducted by Parties to the CBD. We conducted a detailed, systematic analysis of 114 CBD 5th (submitted 2014) and 6th (submitted 2018) National Reports to quantitatively assess actions, progress on targets, values and indicators related to genetic diversity. First, we found that the importance of genetic diversity is recognised by most Parties to the CBD, and that recognition increased over time. However, genetic targets mainly addressed genetic diversity within cultivated plants, farm animals, and crop wild relatives, with little focus on other wild species. Also, actions for conserving genetic diversity primarily concerned ex-situ facilities and policy, rather than monitoring and intervention for maintaining genetic diversity in situ. The most commonly used indicators of genetic diversity status were the number of genetic resources in conservation facilities, number of threatened breeds, and Red List Index, which are not well correlated to genetic erosion in most species -- highlighting that genetic change is poorly monitored by current indicators. Lastly, analyses of genetic data observations, indigenous use and knowledge of genetic diversity, and strategies being developed and implemented to conserve genetic diversity are highly under-reported. We make several recommendations for the post-2020 CBD Biodiversity Framework to improve awareness, assessment, and monitoring, and facilitate consistent and complete reporting of progress of genetic diversity in future National Reports.

Article Impact StatementAn analysis of genetic diversity in CBD National Reports neglects non-domesticated species and demonstrates need for sufficient indicators."

COVID-19 pandemic has forced more than one billion students out of school, has disrupted the world and led all university courses switched to online instruction social distancing actions taken to limit the spread of the virus. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the pandemic related changes for undergraduate students, to assess their perspectives related to their learning, experiences in two courses, and to discuss the far-reaching potential implications for the upcoming summer and fall semesters. An electronic survey was conducted to gather data on the student perceptions and learning characteristics of this transition from face-to-face (F2F) to online at a medium-sized university in the Southeast in the Spring 2020 semester. Nearly 88% of the participants indicated that the COVID-19 pandemic impacted their education, while 19% indicated that they prefer online over F2F learning. Furthermore, the online modality significantly increased attendance in General Biology I. Our study also showed that the usage of live conferencing and digital applications increased due to the pandemic. The current research fills the gap in the existing literature by providing the first study on the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on undergraduate learning and experiences in the most unique dual modality of the Spring 2020 semester."

But the oversimplification of data by only plotting the statistical summaries conflicts with the transparent communication of results. Therefore, plotting of all data is generally encouraged and this can be achieved by using a dotplot for discrete conditions. Dotplots, however, often fail to communicate whether the data are from different technical or biological replicates. The superplot has been proposed to improve the communication of experimental design and results. To simplify the plotting of data from discrete conditions as a superplot, the SuperPlotsOfData web app was generated. The tool offers easy and open access to state-of-the-art data visualization. In addition, it incorporates recent innovations in data visualization and analysis, including raindcloud plots and estimation statistics.

Y.; Nicholson, E.; Ogrodnik, M.; Fenesi, B.; Heisz, J. J.",Maryam  Yvonne  Marashi,2020-09-03,scientific communication and education,"The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the mental health, physical activity, and sedentary behavior of citizens worldwide. Using an online survey with 1669 respondents, we sought to understand why and how by querying about perceived barriers and motivators to physical activity that changed because of the pandemic, and how those changes impacted mental health. Consistent with prior reports, our respondents were less physically active (aerobic activity, -11%, p <0.05; strength-based activity, -30%, p<0.01) and more sedentary (+11%, p<0.01) during the pandemic as compared to 6-months before. The pandemic also increased psychological stress (+22%, p <0.01) and brought on moderate symptoms of anxiety and depression. Respondents whose mental health deteriorated the most were also the ones who were least active (depression r = -.21, p<0.01; anxiety r = -.12, p<0.01). The majority of respondents were unmotivated to exercise because they were too anxious (+8%, p <0.01), lacked social support (+6%, p =<0.01), or had limited access to equipment (+23%, p <0.01) or space (+41%, p <0.01). The respondents who were able to stay active reported feeling less motivated by physical health outcomes such as weight loss (-7%, p<0.01) or strength (-14%, p<0.01) and instead more motivated by mental health outcomes such as anxiety relief (+14%, p <0.01). Coupled with previous work demonstrating a direct relationship between mental health and physical activity, these results highlight the potential protective effect of physical activity on mental health and point to the need for psychological support to overcome perceived barriers so that people can continue to be physically active during stressful times like the pandemic."

In this pandemic moment it is relevant to observe how organizations behave to seek quick and safe answers. The present research analyzes how the cooperation networks were set off considering the clinical trials on therapies and vaccines that were developed specifically to treat or prevent COVID-19. Social Network Analysis technique was used to build cooperation networks and apply metrics that characterize these connections. There was an evaluation of statistics of Strength of cooperation and Unilateral dependence of cooperation that identify the cooperation strength between two organizations, and the dependence of this relations. A total of 415 clinical trial were identified, of which 42% are in cooperation. From organizations that have partnership, firms are the first, followed by universities. We extracted the main categories that concentrate 74% of partnerships in the trials of antibody, and vaccine. Several organizations cooperate in multiple categories of trials, evidencing the efforts to focus on different strategies to treat the disease. We found high strength of cooperation and an assimetryc dependency between partners, which can be assigned to specialized models of partnership and it occurs in competitive enviroments like this pandemic moment. Cooperation were not limited to geographical proximity and the advent of Chinese players can represent a new change in the biotechnological development axis. Finally, the challenge of finding therapeutic or immunological solutions for COVID-19 demonstrates a clear composition of cooperation groups that complement their skills to manage organizational strategies to beat the pandemic. In this new paradigm, there can be partnerships not only in clinical trial but also in pre-competitive technologies development. This experience is expected to change the way of organizations define their R&D strategies and start to adopt more a collaborative innovation model."

MethodsThis was a prospective cohort study of one hundred and fifty consecutive women undergoing IVF-ET/ICSI that were recruited from February 1, 2017 to October 31, 2018 at the Fertility centre of the National Hospital, Abuja, Nigeria. Participants plasma AMH were assayed and were followed up till achieving fertilization and pregnancy. Association between AMH levels, fertilization and pregnancy rates was assessed using univariable and multivariable logistic regression modelling to adjust for confounding variables.

ResultsThe mean age and mean AMH level of the participants were 36 {+/-} 4.2 years and 1.74 {+/-} 2.35ng/ml respectively. There was a statistically significant association between AMH level and age (P <0.001), duration of infertility (P =0.026), cause of infertility (P =0.035), number of oocytes retrieved (P =<0.001), number of embryos generated (P =<0.001) and type of treatment (P =<0.001). However, there was no significant difference in the fertilization rates (adjusted odds ratio [AdjOR] 0.36, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.23-4.30; P =0.533) and pregnancy rates (AdjOR 0.26, 95% CI 0.04-2.00; P =0.210) at different plasma levels of AMH.

ConclusionPlasma AMH level was not a predictor of fertilization and pregnancy rates among our cohort of patients who had IVF/ICSI treatment cycles."

While, a number of these solutions have been implemented, one solution that has not been broadly adopted, despite being widely recommended, is to increase the number of staff scientists and reduce dependency on trainees. The perceived impediment of this is the cost. This paper explores the costs associated with laboratory personnel and the benefits, in terms of productivity, associated with different positions in the workforce. The results of this cost-benefit analysis depend upon the values assigned to different metrics of productivity by individuals and institutions. If first and senior author publications are the most important metrics of productivity, a trainee dependent workforce is much more cost effective. If total publications is the most valued metric of productivity, the cost effectiveness of trainee and staff scientists is reasonably equitable. This analysis provides data for consideration when making personnel decisions and for the continued discussion of modification of the biomedical research workforce. It also provides insight into the incentives for modification of the workforce at the grass roots, which must be considered by institutions genuinely committed to workforce modification to sustain the biomedical research enterprise."

G.; Yismaw, E.; Tsegaw, B. D.; Shibeshi, A. D.",Shewayiref  Geremew  Gebremichael,2020-09-09,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundClean water is an essential element for human health, wellbeing, and prosperity. Every human being has the right to access safe drinking water. But, in now day, due to rapid population growth, illiteracy, lack of sustainable development, and climate change; it still faces a global challenge for about one billion people in the developing nation. The discontinuity of drinking water supply puts in force households either to use unsafe water storage materials or to use water from unimproved sources. This study aimed to identify the determinants of water source types, use, quality of water, and sanitation perception of physical parameters among urban households in North-West Ethiopia.

MethodsA community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among households from February to March 2019. An interview-based pre-tested and structured questionnaire was used to collect the data. Data collection samples were selected randomly and proportional to each kebeles households. MS Excel and R Version 3.6.2 was used to enter and analyze the data; respectively. Descriptive statistics using frequencies and percentages were used to explain the sample data concerning the predictor variable. Both bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions were used to assess the association between the independent and the response variables.

ResultsFour hundred eighteen (418) households have participated. Based on the study undertaken, 78.95% of households used improved and 21.05% of households used unimproved drinking water sources. Households drinking water sources are significantly associated with age of participant (x2 = 20.392, df=3), educational status (x2 = 19.358, df=4), source of income (x2 = 21.777, df=3), monthly income (x2 = 13.322, df=3), availability of additional facilities (x2 = 98.144, df=7), cleanness status (x2 =42.979, df=4), scarcity of water (x2 = 5.1388, df=1) and family size (x2 = 9.934, df=2). The logistic regression analysis also indicated as those factors are significantly determined (p 0.05) the water source types used by households. Factors such as availability of toilet facility, household member type, and sex of head of the household are not significantly associated with the drinking water sources.

ConclusionThe study showed that being an older age group of the head of the household, being government employer, merchant and self-employed, being a higher income group, the presence of all facilities in the area, lived in a clean surrounding and lower family size are the determinant factors of using drinking water from improved sources. Therefore; the local, regional, and national governments and other supporting organizations shall improve the accessibility and adequacy of drinking water from improved sources through short and long time plans for the well-being of the community in the area."

Multifold financial and academic incentives exist for the quickest possible translation from preclinical to clinical studies. This study demonstrates that the majority of 46 preclinical SCGE studies discussed in expert reviews as particularly promising for clinical translation do not report on seven key elements for robust and confirmatory research practices: (1) randomization, (2) blinding, (3) sample size calculation, (4) data handling, (5) pre-registration, (6) multi-centric study design, and (7) independent confirmation. Against the background of the high incentives for clinical translation and recent concerns about the reproducibility of published preclinical evidence, we present the here examined reporting standards (1-4) and the new NIH funding criteria for SCGE research (6-7) as a viable solution to protect this promising field from backlashes. We argue that the implementation of the novel methodological standards, e.g. ""confirmation"" and ""pre-registration"", is promising for preclinical SCGE research and provides an opportunity to become a lighthouse example for trust-worthy and useful translational research."

Brazil stood out in the number of publications, reflecting the concern of Brazilian researchers to promote sustainability and biodiversity maintenance. As for the approaches, the studies are broad, ranging from the influence of policies on environmental protection to the importance of reflection at a global level, proposing international agreements.

Most of the works focused on reporting quality of clinical trials and observational longitudinal studies. However, few focused on that of trend analyses. The reporting of recommended statistic metrics in trend analyses was also largely unclear. Therefore, we examined reporting quality of the trend analyses based on reporting of recommended statistic metrics. We systemically searched the PubMed for the trend-analysis articles published in 10 leading medicine and oncology journals during the 11 years from 2008 to 2018. The studies published after 2019 were not included due to the sudden, significant increase of publication number during and immediately after the COVID-19 pandemic. Only original articles, research letters and meta-analyses/systematic reviews were included. We scored the reporting quality of these articles based on whether they reported p-values/effect-sizes, and beta/co-efficient/slope/annual-percentage-change (APC). There were 297 qualified articles, among which 193 (66.0%) and 216 (72.7%) articles reported P-value and effect-size, respectively. Only 13 (5.8%) analyses reported neither p-value/effect size nor beta/coefficient/slope/APC. In multivariable regression models, author affiliation of epidemiology department was associated with less reporting effect-size, but that of statistics department with more reporting. Interestingly, U.S. senior-authors (versus non-U.S.) more likely reported p-values. No factors were independently linked to reporting APC. The reporting quality of trend analyses in leading medicine and oncology journals appear moderate and should be further improved. We thus call for more research and awareness of reporting-quality in trend analyses in oncology research and beyond."

The implementation of learner-centered teaching practices in STEM can both benefit or be constrained by different factors related to individual instructors and the teaching environment. However, we know little of how the instructional climate varies across institutions and how this climate affects teaching practices. Our study sought to describe the relative importance of environmental influences and individual characteristics on learner- centered teaching practices across institutions. We also assessed departmental climate for 35 US higher education institutions. We found that self-efficacy in teaching and professional development exert a strong influence on faculty teaching practices. While departmental climate did not emerge as a significant predictor of teaching practices, there was consistently low support for teaching, and institution size was negatively correlated with leadership and evaluation of effective teaching. We also found that professional development may prepare instructors to teach learner-centered courses in different collegial teaching climates. Our results suggest that through cultivating self-efficacy and participating in iterative professional development, instructors can implement effective teaching practices across institutional environments."

Most of the proposed solutions suffer from three fundamental shortcomings: they involve i) the concept of journal, in one way or another, ii) calculating arithmetic averages from extremely skewed distributions, and iii) binning data by calendar year. Here, we introduce a new metric Co-citation Percentile Rank (CPR), that relates the current citation rate of the target output taken at resolution of days since first citable, to the distribution of current citation rates of outputs in its co-citation set, as its percentile rank in that set. We explore some of its properties with an example dataset of all scholarly outputs from University of Jyvaskyla spanning multiple years and disciplines. We also demonstrate how CPR can be efficiently implemented with Dimensions database API, and provide a publicly available web resource JYUcite, allowing anyone to retrieve CPR value for any output that has a DOI and is indexed in the Dimensions database. Finally, we discuss how CPR remedies failures of the Relative Citation Ratio (RCR), and remaining issues in situations where CPR too could potentially lead to biased judgement of value."

D.; Garimella, S.; Konie, A.; Leach, S. B.; Oxford, E. M.",Stephanie D Clark,2020-09-28,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundDilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is considered a predominantly inherited disease in dogs. Recent reports suggest an increased incidence of DCM in atypical breeds eating grain-free and/or legume-rich diets. However, little data regarding incidence of DCM within the US is available; and no existing data quantifies DCM among breeds over time.

HypothesisWe hypothesized that DCM incidence among breeds could be estimated by retrospective polling of veterinary cardiologists. Further, if a correlation existed between grain-free diets and DCM, an increase in DCM would be on trend with increased grain-free pet food sales.

Materials and MethodsThirty-six U.S. cardiology specialty practices were asked for all initial canine and DCM cases evaluated from 2000-2019; fourteen cardiology practices participated. DCM signalment data was provided by three hospitals over 15 years; representing 68 breeds. Age distribution of DCM cases upon diagnosis were compared to other cardio cases and general hospital population from one hospital. All data were evaluated using linear regression models. Grain-free pet food sales data was evaluated from 2011-2019.

ResultsFourteen hospitals participated and reported 67,243 unique canine patients. Nationally, data did not support a significant change in percent DCM over time (p=0.85). The overall average incidence rate of DCM during the study period was 3.83% (range 2.41-5.65%), while grain-free diet sales increased 500% from 2011-2019. No correlation between overall DCM incidence and grain free diet sales was discovered. A significant upward trend in mixed breeds diagnosed with DCM, with no significant trend in other breeds was appreciated. An upward trend in age at DCM diagnosis was identified, correlating with trends from overall hospital populations.

ConclusionsThese data do not support overall increased DCM incidence, or a correlation with grain-free pet food sales. Additional data are necessary to understand whether regional factors contribute to increased DCM within smaller cohorts."

Hence, best practices for training the future biomedical workforce are of national concern. Complementing coursework and laboratory research training, many institutions now offer professional training that enables career exploration and develops a broad set of skills critical to various career paths. The National Institutes of Health funded academic institutions to design innovative programming to enable this professional development through a mechanism known as Broadening Experiences in Scientific Training (BEST). Programming at the BEST awardee institutions included career panels, skill-building workshops, job-searching workshops, site visits, and internships. An initial concern was since doctoral training is lengthy and requires focused attention on dissertation research, having students participate in additional complementary training activities might lengthen time to degree and hamper student research productivity. To address this concern, using time to degree and publication records as measures of efficiency and productivity, metrics were analyzed from ten BEST awardee institutions. Comparing doctoral students who participated to those who did not, results revealed that across these diverse academic institutions, there were no differences in time to degree or manuscript output. Furthermore, a few institutions even demonstrated a positive correlation between participation in career and professional development activities and productivity. Our findings suggest that doctoral students should be encouraged to participate in career and professional development opportunities to ensure their preparedness for a variety of diverse and important careers in the workforce.

Significance StatementOur study is unique in that it compiled doctoral degree durations at ten different universities, recorded individual participation in career and professional development activities in terms of dosage, and tracked individual engagement in real-time rather than relying on surveys sent to trainees after graduation. Participation in career and professional development activities, including internships, did not decrease efficiency or productivity. Our findings suggest that doctoral students should be encouraged to participate in career and professional development opportunities to ensure their preparedness for a variety of diverse and important careers in the workforce."

To investigate the effect of incorporating receptor dynamics on ligand affinity rankings, we employed the Relaxed Complex Scheme, a molecular docking method paired with molecular dynamics-generated receptor conformations. We found that CatS is a difficult target for molecular docking and we explore some advanced methods such as distance-restrained docking to try to improve the correlation with experiments. This project has exemplified the capabilities of high school students when supported with a rigorous curriculum, and demonstrates the value of community-driven competitions for beginners in computational drug discovery."

We develop a Bayesian method to estimate the time of appearance for a phrase in the literature, and apply it to a number of phrases, both automatically extracted and suggested by experts. We see that presently most phrases appear first in the traditional journals, but there is a number of phrases with the first appearance on preprint servers. A comparison of the general composition of texts from bioRxiv and traditional journals shows a growing trend of bioRxiv being predictive of traditional journals. We discuss the application of the method for related problems."

E.; Bodiya, E. C.; Subramanian, S.",Shoba  Subramanian,2020-10-08,scientific communication and education,"Career and professional development competencies are critical for biomedical PhD and postdoctoral training. In the current educational landscape, programs that meet these competencies are offered and attended in an ad hoc manner. During the COVID-19 pandemic and the accompanying switch to virtual learning, our team observed a surge in interest for our weekly non-sequential programs. In this study, we surveyed our learners to better understand motivators for attending these programs during the pandemic and to identify barriers for participating in such events before and during Work-From-Home. Our data indicate that conflict with research responsibilities, time spent to get to the event location, and planning time to attend are all significant barriers to engagement. Notably, feelings of being overwhelmed, which increased slightly during the pandemic, stood out as an identified barrier. Per our results, the virtual format was an attraction. While 58% of respondents would prefer to access professional development programs virtually in the future, almost 42% indicated a preference for in-person events when normalcy resumes as the physical presence of an instructor and of peers result in a deeper engagement. Our collective analysis here suggests that learners will benefit from a hybrid or combination of synchronous and asynchronous career and professional development programming in the future, even post-pandemic, to reduce identified barriers. Alongside hybrid learning engagements, we strongly recommend structured time for learners to enhance their professional competencies, enabled by a commitment from departments and faculty mentors to enable equity in professional skill building and fostering lifelong growth mindset."

A total of 123 individuals responded representing academic ranks from trainee to full professor, tenured and fixed-term appointments, and all genders. The survey included both quantitative and free text responses. Results revealed considerable concern about the impact of COVID-19 on research with the greatest concern reported by individuals in non-permanent positions and female researchers. Concerns about the availability of funding and the impact of the pandemic on career progression were commonly reported by early career researchers. We provide recommendations for institutions, organizations such as the PGC, as well as individual senior investigators to ensure that the futures of early career investigators, especially those underrepresented in academic medicine such as women and underrepresented minorities, are not disproportionately disadvantaged by the COVID-19 pandemic."
10.1101/2020.10.08.331413,Current practices in scientific poster preparation: survey results,"Jambor, H.",Helena  Jambor,2020-10-08,scientific communication and education,"Posters are intended to spark scientific dialogue and omnipresent at biological conferences. Guides and how-to articles help life scientists in preparing informative visualizations in poster format. However, those posters shown at conferences are at present often overloaded with data and text and are poorly designed, which in sum hinder, rather than spark communication. Here, we surveyed life scientists themselves to understand why posters are such a struggle and to shed light on poster preparation from their subjective perspectives. We find that biologist spend on average two entire days preparing one poster, with half of the time devoted to visual design aspects. Most respond that they receive no design or software training and also receive little to no feedback when preparing their visualizations. In conclusion, our data suggests that some training, beyond providing literature, of life scientists in visualization principles and tools would likely improve conference poster quality. In addition, this would also improve other common visuals such as figures and slides, and thus overall benefit the science communication of researchers."

Sixty-nine percent of comments were posted by non-authors (n=1,366), and 31% by preprint authors (n=617). Twelve percent of non-author comments (n=168) were full review reports traditionally found during journal review, while the rest most commonly contained praises (n=577, 42%), suggestions (n=399, 29%), or criticisms (n=226, 17%). Authors comments most commonly contained publication status updates (n=354, 57%), additional study information (n=158, 26%), or solicited feedback for the preprints (n=65, 11%).

E.; Subramanian, S.",Shoba  Subramanian,2020-10-15,scientific communication and education,"Postdoctoral training enables research independence and professional readiness. National reports have emphasized professional development as a critical component of this training period. In response, many institutions are establishing transferable skills training workshops for postdocs; however, the lack of structured programs and an absence of methods to assess outcomes beyond participant satisfaction surveys are critical gaps in postdoctoral training. To address these shortcomings, we took the approach of structured programming and developed a method for controlled assessment of outcomes. Our program You3 (You, Your Team, Your Project), co-designed by postdoctoral fellows, focused on a structured array of management and leadership skills agnostic of ultimate career path(s). We then measured outcomes in a controlled manner, by systematically comparing perceived knowledge and growth of participants with non-participants as the control group. You3 participants discern greater growth, independent of number of years in training, in competencies overall compared to the control group. This growth was shown by multiple criteria including self-reporting and associative analysis. Correspondingly, You3 participants reported greater knowledge in 75% of the modules when compared to controls. These data indicate that structured learning, where postdocs commit to a curriculum via a cohort-structure, leads to positive outcomes and provides a framework for programs to assess outcomes in a rigorous manner."

In this laboratory module, students learn about RNA interference (RNAi) and codon optimization using the research organism Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Students are given the opportunity to perform a commonly used method of gene downregulation in C. elegans where they visualize gene depletion using fluorescence microscopy and quantify the efficacy of depletion using quantitative image analysis. The module presented here educates students on how to report their results and findings by generating publication quality figures and figure legends.

The h-index, and its variants, measure publication output (number of publications) and impact (number of citations), and these are often used to allocate funding or jobs. Here we argue that the emphasis on publication output and impact hinders progress in the fields of ecology and evolution as it disincentivises two fundamental practices: generating long-term datasets and sharing data. We describe a new author-level metric, the data-index, which values dataset output and impact and promotes generating and sharing data as a result. It is designed to complement other metrics of scientific success, as scientific contributions are diverse and our value system should reflect that. Future work should focus on designing alternative metrics that value our wider merits, such as communicating our research, informing policy, mentoring other scientists, and providing open-access code and tools."

The mismatch between the ability to generate large data sets and the computing skill to analyze them is arguably the most striking within the life sciences. The Digital Image and Vision Applications in Science (DIVAS) project describes a scaffolded series of interventions implemented over the span of a year to build the coding and computing skill of undergraduate students majoring primarily in the natural sciences. The program is designed as a community of practice, providing support within a network of learners. The program focus, images as data, provides a compelling  hook for participating scholars. Scholars begin the program with a one-credit spring semester seminar where they are exposed to image analysis. The program continues in the summer with a one-week, intensive Python and image processing workshop. From there, scholars tackle image analysis problems using a pair programming approach and finish the summer with independent research. Finally, scholars participate in a follow-up seminar the following spring and help onramp the next cohort of incoming scholars. We observed promising growth in participant self-efficacy in computing that was maintained throughout the project as well as significant growth in key computational skills. DIVAS program funding was able to support seventeen DIVAS over three years, with 76% of DIVAS scholars identifying as women and 14% of scholars being members of an underrepresented minority group. Most scholars (82%) entered the program as freshmen, with 89% of DIVAS scholars retained for the duration of the program and 100% of scholars remaining a STEM major one year after completing the program. The outcomes of the DIVAS project support the efficacy of building computational skill through repeated exposure of scholars to relevant applications over an extended period within a community of practice."

O.; Haverfield, J.; Tannenbaum, C.",Cara  Tannenbaum,2020-10-26,scientific communication and education,"The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed and exacerbated gender biases in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine. Accumulating evidence suggests that female scientists productivity dropped during the initial lockdown period. With more time being spent on caregiving responsibilities, women may be struggling to collaborate on grant applications and launch new experiments. Scientists with disabilities or who belong to Indigenous nations or communities of color may have less time to devote to research due to health, family, or community needs. Collateral damage in this situation, the appropriate integration of sex, gender, and other identity characteristics in research content may also suffer. Sex and gender are better attended to when female scientists form part of the research team. Research funding agencies have a role to play in mitigating these effects by putting in place gender equity policies that support all applicants and ensure research quality. Accordingly, a national health research funder implemented gender policy changes that included extending deadlines and factoring sex and gender into COVID-19 grant requirements. Following these changes, the funder received more applications from female scientists, awarded a greater proportion of grants to female compared to male scientists, and received and funded more grant applications that considered sex and gender in the content of COVID-19 research. Whether or not these strategies will be sufficient in the long-term to prevent widening of the gender gap in science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine requires continued monitoring and oversight. Further work is urgently required to mitigate inequities associated with identity characteristics beyond gender."

To that end, we employ stochastic simulations to model human-fomite interaction with a distinct focus on touchscreen interfaces. The timings and frequency of interactions from within a closed population of infectious and susceptible individuals was modelled using a basic queuing network. A pseudo reproductive number (R) was used to compare outcomes under various parameter conditions. We also expanded the simulation to a specific real-world scenario; namely airport self check-in and baggage drop. Results revealed that the required rate of cleaning/disinfecting of screens to effectively mitigate R can be inordinately high. This suggests that revised or alternative methods should be considered."

This is not generally the result of explicit and easily recognizable gender biases but the outcome of decisions with many components of unconscious nature that are difficult to assess. Evidence suggests that implicit gender stereotypes influence perceptions as well as decisions. To explore these potential reasons of womens underrepresentation in life sciences we analyzed the outcome of gender-science and gender-career Implicit Association Tests (IAT) taken by 2,589 scientists working in high profile biomedical research centers. We found that male-science association is less pronounced among researchers than in the general population (34% below the level of the general population). However, this difference is mostly explained by the low level of the IAT score among female researchers. Despite the highly meritocratic view of the academic career, male scientists have a high level of male-science association (261% the level among women scientists), similar to the general population."

Our results indicate remarkable improvements in some (e.g. conflict of interest disclosures, funding disclosures), but not other (e.g. protocol registration, code sharing) areas of transparency over time, and map transparency across fields of science, countries, journals and publishers. This work has enabled the creation of a large, integrated, and openly available database to expedite further efforts to monitor, understand and promote transparency and reproducibility in science."

The results showed that farmers used 16, six and two varieties for hybrid, Open-pollinated varieties (OPV) and local maize respectively. Farmers sourced Hybrid and OPV maize seed from Private Agro dealers while local maize was own-sourced. Farmers preferred local maize for being cheap, good taste, low storage costs, and pest resistance although low yielding. They preferred hybrid and OPV maize for high yielding and early maturity despite demanding high storage costs, pest susceptibility, and low flour. From 2004/05-2018/19, the area under local and OPV maize reduced by 61% and 12% respectively, while that of hybrid maize increased by 49%. However, the consistent decrease in area for hybrid and OPV and significant increase of that of local maize from 2014/15-2018/19 may signal a catastrophic maize production in the region. From 2019/20-2025/26 production of all maize was projected at 44 172 tons by 2025/26, representing a 1.6% increase from the base year 2019/20. This increase will be due to favorable climatic conditions and not increase in area or yield. If maize yield was improved by 30% production would increase to 110 430 tons representing 67% of the food requirement in the study area. The current maize production trend in Salima does not guarantee food security prospects. Therefore, policymakers should consider reviewing the past interventions (input pricing, promotion strategies, sustainable practices, policies) in the maize subsector to enhance maize productivity."

Practicing appropriate preventive measures to control COVID-19 infection is one of the most important interventions that healthcare workers are expected to use. The aim of this study was to assess the level of risk perception and practices of preventive measures of COVID-19 among health workers in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted from 9th to 26th June 2020 among healthcare professionals working at six public hospitals in Addis Ababa. Data were collected using a self-administered structured questionnaire. Frequency, percentage, and mean were used to summarize the data. A binary logistic regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with risk perception about COVID-19. A total of 1,134 participants were surveyed. Wearing facemask (93%), hand washing for at least 20 seconds (93%), covering mouth and nose while coughing or sneezing (91%), and avoiding touching eyes, nose, and mouth (91%) were the commonly self-reported preventive practices. About 88% perceived that they were worried about the risk of becoming infected with coronavirus, and majority (91%) worried about the risk of infection to their family. The mean score of overall fear and worry of COVID-19 was 2.37 on a scale of 1 to 3. Respondents who ever provided clinical care to COVID-19 patients were more likely to report fear and worry (adjusted OR=1.34, 95% CI:1.02-1.91), however those who ever participated in Ebola or SARS outbreaks were less likely to report fear and worry due to COVID-19 crisis (adjusted OR=0.66, 95% CI:0.48-0.90). This study has revealed widespread practices of preventive measures and the highest perceived risk of COVID-19 among healthcare workers. Therefore, an effective risk communication intervention should be implemented to ensure the maintenance of appropriate practices during the current COVID-19 pandemic."

MethodA cross-sectional survey was conducted with 330 students from different public and Private Universities in Dhaka, Bangladesh between April 01, 2020 and July 31, 2020 amid the COVID-19 lockdown period in Bangladesh. A standard, self-administered online questionnaire consisting of questions on socio-demographic variables, mental health status, as well as stress management sent to the respondents through social networking platforms. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, t-test, one-way ANOVA and correlation tests.

ResultsThe mean score of mental health status was 2.08 based on four points scale. They felt problem in decision making (3.04), in doing the things well (2.92), in enjoying normal day to day life (2.88), in playing a useful part in life (2.85), in doing their task (2.75), living in perfectly well and in good health (2.70). The respondents also developed a suicidal tendency (2.55), felt nervous in strung-up (2.24), took longer time to do things (2.14), felt tightness and pressure in head (2.12), and found themselves pressurized by various stuff (2.05). This study also found a significant positive relationship between mental health status and age, living with parents, and parents attitude. Finally, this study revealed that the respondents managed their stress by chatting with their friends, parents and siblings, and by sleeping.

ConclusionMental health status of adolescents was found moderate in this study. This study suggests further large-scale study including different socio-economic settings in order to figure out the real scenario of adolescents mental health status of the country during the pandemic."

K.",Megan K Barker,2020-11-20,scientific communication and education,"Undergraduate science students spend a substantial amount of time working in their laboratory groups, and instructors want to make evidence-based decisions on how to best set up these groups. Despite several studies on group composition, the evidence appears to be quite context-specific, and very little has been published about lab groups. Further, many studies focus solely on conceptual learning; however, the lab is an important venue for also supporting non-content outcomes such as confidence, process skills, team skills, and attitudes. Thus, in our introductory course on molecules, cells, and physiology we were interested in the impact of group composition, on a spread of student outcomes. Students were either placed into groups by the instructor, or self-selected into groups. To assess the impact of group composition on student outcome, we collected pre/post data from >500 students over 2 semesters. Our measures assess conceptual knowledge, confidence in lab skills, attitudes toward group learning, lab grades, gender, year of study, and (via open-ended questions) student perspectives. Using a multiple regression approach, we established models that predict student outcomes based on their individual attributes and on their lab group attributes. Surprisingly, the hetero/homogeneity of the initial group, and whether the groups were student- or instructor-selected, did not affect student outcomes in these models. Further MANCOVA analysis demonstrated that student interaction outside of the lab time was the strongest predictor of positive student attitudes toward group learning. Student perspectives on group formation are mixed, and suggest that a simple and flexible choice approach may best support our students. Overall, these findings have clear implications for our course design and instructional choices: we should focus our efforts to promote positive student interactions, rather than worrying about initial composition."

The Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Comprehensive Cancer Center supports two pipeline programs, which traditionally immerse high school juniors, seniors, and early undergraduate students from underrepresented populations in science in hands-on projects in cancer biology labs. However, due to social distancing policies during the pandemic and reduction of research operations, these students were not physically allowed on campus. Thus, the authors set out to strategically pivot to a wholly virtual curriculum and evaluate the Virtual Summer Research Experience in Cancer outcomes.

MethodsThe virtual program included four components: 1. a core science and professional development curriculum led by high school teachers and senior undergraduates; 2. faculty-delivered didactic sessions on cancer science; 3. mentored, virtual research projects with research faculty; and 4. online networking events to encourage vertical mentoring. Outcomes data were measured using an 11-item Research Preparation scale, daily electronic feedback, and structured evaluation and feedback via Zoom weekly.

ResultsOutcome data suggested high self-reported satisfaction with the virtual program. Outcome data also revealed the importance of coordination between multiple entities for seamless program implementation. This includes the active recruitment and participation of high school teachers and further investment in information technology capabilities of institutions.

ConclusionsFindings reveal a path to educate and train high school and early undergraduate students in cancer research when hands-on, in-person training is not feasible.

We aimed to evaluate: (i) whether COVID-19-related preprints were favored for publication, (ii) preprinting trends and public discussion of the preprints, and (iii) the relationship between the publication topic (COVID-19-related or not) and quality issues.

MethodsManuscripts deposited at bioRxiv and medRxiv between January 1 and September 27 were assessed for the probability of publishing in peer-reviewed journals, and those published were evaluated for submission-to-acceptance time. The extent of public discussion was assessed based on Altmetric and Disqus data. The Retraction Watch Database and PubMed were used to explore the retraction of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 articles and preprints.

ResultsWith adjustment for the preprinting server and number of deposited versions, COVID-19-related preprints were more likely to be published within 120 days since the deposition of the first version (OR=2.04, 95%CI 1.87-2.23) as well as over the entire observed period (OR=1.42, 95%CI 1.33-1.52). Submission-to-acceptance was by 38.67 days (95%CI 34.96-42.39) shorter for COVID-19 articles. Public discussion of preprints was modest and COVID-19 articles were overrepresented in the pool of retracted articles in 2020.

ConclusionCurrent data suggest a preference for publication of COVID-19-related preprints over the observed period."

Design/Methodology/ApproachWe examined bibliometric measures for COVID-19 and the rest of studied epidemics/pandemics. Data were extracted from Web of Science, using its journal classification scheme as a proxy to quantify the multidisciplinary coverage of scientific output. We proposed a novel Thematic Dispersion Index (TDI) for the analysis of pandemic early stages.

Results/DiscussionThe literature on the seven epidemics/pandemics before COVID-19 has shown explosive growth of the scientific production and continuous impact during the first three years following each emergence or re-emergence of the specific infectious disease. A subsequent decline was observed with the progressive control of each health emergency. We observed an unprecedented growth in COVID-19 scientific production. TDI measured for COVID-19 (29,4) in just six months, was higher than TDI of the rest (7,5 to 21) during the first three years after epidemic initiation.

ConclusionsCOVID-19 literature showed the broadest subject coverage, which is clearly a consecuence of its social, economic, and political impact. The proposed indicator (TDI), allowed the study of multidisciplinarity, differentiating the thematic complexity of COVID-19 from the previous seven epidemics/pandemics.

Originality/ValueThe multidisciplinary nature and thematic complexity of COVID-19 research were successfully analyzed through a scientometric perspective."

D.",Stefano Davide Vianello,2020-11-24,scientific communication and education,"The teaching, learning, communication, and practice of Developmental Biology require interested parties to be at ease with the considerable spatial complexity of the embryo, and with its evolution over time as it undergoes morphogenesis. In practice, the four dimensionality of embryonic development (space and time) calls upon strong visual-spatial literacy and mental manipulation skills, generally expected to be innate or to come through experience. Yet it has been argued that Developmental Biology suffers the most from available traditional media of communication and representation. To date, few resources exist to engage with the embryo in its 3D and 4D aspects, to communicate such aspects in ones work, and to facilitate their exploration in the absence of live observations. I here provide a collection of readily-usable volumetric models for all tissues and stages of mouse peri-implantation development as extracted from the eMouse Atlas Project (E5.0 to E9.0), as well as custom-made models of all pre-implantation stages (E0 to E4.0). These models have been converted to a commonly used 3D format (.stl), and are provided in ready-made files for digital exploration and illustration. Further provided is a step-by-step walkthrough on how to practically use these models for exploration and illustration using the free and open source 3D creation suite Blender. I finally outline possible further uses of these very models in outreach initiatives of varying levels, virtual and augmented reality applications, and 3D printing."

Currently, problematic western blot images are mainly detected by checking repeated bands or through visual observation. However, the completeness of the above methods in detecting problematic images has not been demonstrated. Here we show that Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) can generate realistic western blot images that indistinguishable from real western blots. The overall accuracy of researchers for identifying synthetic western blot images is 0.52, which almost equal to blind guess (0.5). We found that GANs can generate western blot images with bands of the expected lengths, widths, and angles in desired positions that can fool researchers. For the case study, we find that the accuracy of detecting the synthetic western blot images is related to years of researchers performed studies relevant to western blots, but there was no apparent difference in accuracy among researchers with different academic degrees. Our results demonstrate that GANs can generate fake western blot images to fool existing problematic image detection methods. Therefore, more information is needed to ensure that the western blots appearing in scientific articles are real. We argue to require every western blot image to be uploaded along with a unique identifier generated by the laboratory machine and to peer review these images along with the corresponding submitted articles, which may reduce the incidence of scientific fraud."

R.",Stephen A Gallo,2020-11-24,scientific communication and education,"The primary goal of the peer review of research grant proposals is to evaluate their quality for the funding agency. An important secondary goal is to provide constructive feedback to applicants for their resubmissions. However, little is known about whether review feedback achieves this goal. In this paper, we present a mixed methods analysis of responses from grant applicants regarding their perceptions of the effectiveness and appropriateness of peer review feedback they received from grant submissions. Overall, 56%-60% of applicants determined the feedback to be appropriate (fair, well-written, and well-informed), although their judgments were more favorable if their recent application was funded. Importantly, independent of funding success, women found the feedback better written than men, and more white applicants found the feedback to be fair than non-white applicants. Also, perceptions of a variety of biases were specifically reported in respondents feedback. Less than 40% of applicants found the feedback to be very useful in informing their research and improving grantsmanship and future submissions. Further, negative perceptions of the appropriateness of review feedback were positively correlated with more negative perceptions of feedback usefulness. Importantly, respondents suggested that highly competitive funding pay-lines and poor inter-panel reliability limited the usefulness of review feedback. Overall, these results suggest that more effort is needed to ensure that appropriate and useful feedback is provided to all applicants, bolstering the equity of the review process and likely improving the quality of resubmitted proposals."

For research project grants (RPGs) funded by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), this is measured by the success rate, the fraction of grants reviewed in a given fiscal year that are funded. In 2016, I posted a relatively simple computational model that allowed estimation of these success rates from historical data of NIH appropriations and associated data, based largely on the fact that commitments to fund NIH grants are typically made over four fiscal years rather than coming from a single fiscal years appropriations. Data for appropriations and success rates for fiscal years 2016-2020 are now available, allowing this model to be tested without no adjustable parameters. Over this period, the NIH appropriation increased by 29.7% to $39.313 billion, yet the RPG success rate increased from 0.183 to 0.201, a relative increase of only 9.8%. This difference is accurately reproduced by the model, indicating that the modest changes in success rate despite large appropriation increases reflect the consequences of the funding grants from multiple fiscal years and the response of the biomedical research community in submitting an increased number of proposals. The model can also be extended to estimate the success rates for individual institutes with reasonable accuracy."

Yet there is a relatively small number of validated questionnaires that measure these attitudes. The goal of our study was to construct and validate such a questionnaire. Using a sample of Croatian scientists (N=541), from a wide range of disciplines, we developed a questionnaire titled Attitudes towards Open data sharing, preprinting, and peer-review (ATOPP). The questionnaire has 21 item with a four-factor structure (attitudes towards: open data, preprint servers, open peer-review and open peer-review in small scientific communities). Based on the questionnaire, the attitudes of Croatian scientists towards these topics were generally neutral, with a median of 3.3 out of 5 of the total attitude score. Croatian scientist attitudes were lowest for open peer-review in small scientific communities (Md 2.0) and highest for open data (Md 3.9)."

Remote evaluation and face-to-face panel meetings compared,"Bieri, M.; Roser, K.; Heyard, R.; Egger, M.",Marco  Bieri,2020-11-26,scientific communication and education,"ObjectivesTo test a simplified evaluation of fellowship proposals by analyzing the agreement of funding decisions with the official evaluation, and to examine the use of a lottery-based decision for proposals of similar quality.

DesignThe study involved 134 junior fellowship proposals (Postdoc.Mobility). The official method used two panel reviewers who independently scored the application, followed by triage and discussion of selected applications in a panel. Very competitive/uncompetitive proposals were directly funded/rejected without discussion. The simplified procedure used the scores of the two panel members, with or without the score of an additional, third expert. Both methods could further use a lottery to decide on applications of similar quality close to the funding threshold. The same funding rate was applied, and the agreement between the two methods analyzed.

SettingSwiss National Science Foundation (SNSF).

ParticipantsPostdoc.Mobility panel reviewers and additional expert reviewers.

Primary outcome measurePer cent agreement between the simplified and official evaluation method with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).

ResultsThe simplified procedure based on three reviews agreed in 80.6% (95% CI 73.9-87.3) with the official funding outcome. The agreement was 86.6% (95% CI 80.8-92.4) when using the two reviews of the panel members. The agreement between the two methods was lower for the group of applications discussed in the panel (64.2% and 73.1%, respectively), and higher for directly funded/rejected applications (range 96.7% to 100%). The lottery was used in eight (6.0%) of 134 applications (official method), 19 (14.2%) applications (simplified, three reviewers) and 23 (17.2%) applications (simplified, two reviewers). With the simplified procedure, evaluation costs could have been halved and 31 hours of meeting time saved for the two 2019 calls.

ConclusionAgreement between the two methods was high. The simplified procedure could represent a viable evaluation method for the Postdoc.Mobility early career instrument at the SNSF."

E.; Yu, Z.; Wang, J.",Neil  R.  Smalheiser,2020-11-26,scientific communication and education,"A recent flood of publications has documented serious problems in scientific reproducibility, power, and reporting of biomedical articles, yet scientists persist in their usual practices. Why? We examined a popular and important preclinical assay, the Forced Swim Test (FST) in mice used to test putative antidepressants. Whether the mice were assayed in a naive state vs. in a model of depression or stress, and whether the mice were given test agents vs. known antidepressants regarded as positive controls, the mean effect sizes seen in the experiments were indeed extremely large (1.5 - 2.5 in Cohens d units); most of the experiments utilized 7-10 animals per group which did have adequate power to reliably detect effects of this magnitude. We propose that this may at least partially explain why investigators using the FST do not perceive intuitively that their experimental designs fall short -- even though proper prospective design would require ~21-26 animals per group to detect, at a minimum, large effects (0.8 in Cohens d units) when the true effect of a test agent is unknown. Our data provide explicit parameters and guidance for investigators seeking to carry out prospective power estimation for the FST. More generally, altering the real-life behavior of scientists in planning their experiments may require developing educational tools that allow them to actively visualize the inter-relationships among effect size, sample size, statistical power, and replicability in a direct and intuitive manner."

The results show that although the term ehealth originated in the late 1990s, but it has become an envelope term for much older terms such as telemedicine, and its variants which originated much earlier. The keywords were spread in 27 Scopus Subject Areas, with medicine (44.04%), engineering (12.84%) and computer science (11.47%) leading while by Scopus All Science Journal Classification, Health Sciences accounted for 55.83% of the keywords and physical sciences followed with 30.62%. The rest two classifications namely social sciences and life sciences made only single digit contributions. Although the primary essence of ehealth was how to meet health needs, the work of engineers who either initially deployed telephone to meet their health needs or, and, computer scientists, who addressed the need to design technologies for medical services is very significant. It is concluded that ehealth is a multidisciplinary area that is attractive to researchers from all disciplines because of its sensitive focus on health, and therefore requires pooling and integrating of resources and expertise, methods and approaches."

F.",Charles  F  Mactutus,2020-11-27,scientific communication and education,"The translation of preclinical studies to human applications is associated with a high failure rate, which may be exacerbated by limited training in experimental design and statistical analysis. Nested experimental designs, which occur when data have a multilevel structure (e.g., in vitro: cells within a culture dish; in vivo: rats within a litter), often violate the independent observation assumption underlying many traditional statistical techniques. Although previous studies have empirically evaluated the analytic challenges associated with multilevel data, existing work has not focused on key parameters and design components typically observed in preclinical research. To address this knowledge gap, a Monte Carlo simulation study was conducted to systematically assess the effects of inappropriately modeling multilevel data via a fixed effects ANOVA in studies with sparse observations, no between group comparison within a single cluster, and interactive effects. Simulation results revealed a dramatic increase in the probability of type 1 error and relative bias of the standard error as the number of level-1 (e.g., cells; rats) units per cell increased in the fixed effects ANOVA; these effects were largely attenuated when the nesting was appropriately accounted for via a random effects ANOVA. Thus, failure to account for a nested experimental design may lead to reproducibility challenges and inaccurate conclusions. Appropriately accounting for multilevel data, however, may enhance statistical reliability, thereby leading to improvements in translatability. Valid analytic strategies are provided for a variety of design scenarios."

D.; Ellison, G.; Gilthorpe, M.",John  Mbotwa,2020-11-27,scientific communication and education,"The present study aimed to compare the predictive acuity of latent class regression (LCR) modelling with: standard generalised linear modelling (GLM); and GLMs that include the membership of subgroups/classes (identified through prior latent class analysis; LCA) as alternative or additional candidate predictors. Using real world demographic and clinical data from 1,802 heart failure patients enrolled in the UK-HEART2 cohort, the study found that univariable GLMs using LCA-generated subgroup/class membership as the sole candidate predictor of survival were inferior to standard multivariable GLMs using the same four covariates as those used in the LCA. The inclusion of the LCA subgroup/class membership together with these four covariates as candidate predictors in a multivariable GLM showed no improvement in predictive acuity. In contrast, LCR modelling resulted in a 10-14% improvement in predictive acuity and provided a range of alternative models from which it would be possible to balance predictive acuity against entropy to select models that were optimally suited to improve the efficient allocation of clinical resources to address the differential risk of the outcome (in this instance, survival). These findings provide proof-of-principle that LCR modelling can improve the predictive acuity of GLMs and enhance the clinical utility of their predictions. These improvements warrant further attention and exploration, including the use of alternative techniques (including machine learning algorithms) that are also capable of generating latent class structure while determining outcome predictions, particularly for use with large and routinely collected clinical datasets, and with binary, count and continuous variables."

Institutions and professional societies have been putting efforts on building plans that help make workplaces, conferences, education and extension programs more relatable to a highly diverse population. Argentina has an overall gender-balanced workforce in the sciences (~53% women/total), with an even higher representation in disciplines related to plant sciences. However, media outlets and national conferences related to genetics, botany, plant physiology, ecology and molecular biology, fail to reflect those numbers as the proportion of women invited for interviews, plenary lectures, and symposia falls below ~30%. As a way to increase the visibility of the wealth of plant science topics and experimental approaches in which Argentinian women work, and to facilitate connections among them across the country and abroad, we created the Argentinian Women in Plant Science network (https://argplantwomen.weebly.com/). This group has grown to over 200 members, representing a wide range of career stages and research topics. Since April, and taking advantage of the confinement situation, our weekly webinar series highlighting women plant scientists has reached an average audience of 60-70 participants, with a record of 100. Recently, we have begun a series of open professional development webinars to reach a wider public. Our first webinar, focused on Scientific poster design, had ~250 participants, most of them undergrad and graduate students from all over the country covering a diverse range of disciplines, including the social sciences. Even though we have immersed ourselves in the plant science community with our weekly seminars, we have expanded our goals with activities aimed to reach out to a much wider audience with webinars and teacher training workshops, hopefully making plant science more attainable to all."

We argue that such reform should be based on data-driven insights into within- and cross-disciplinary use of research methods. Our survey of peer-reviewed literature screened [~]3.5 million openly available research articles to monitor the cross-disciplinary usage of research methods in the past decade. We applied data-driven text-mining analyses to the methods and materials section of a large subset of this corpus to identify method trends shared across disciplines, as well as those unique to each discipline. As a whole, usage of T-test, analysis of variance, and other classical regression-based methods has declined in the published literature over the past 10 years. Machine-learning approaches, such as artificial neural networks, have seen a significant increase in the total share of scientific publications. We find unique groupings of research methods associated with each biomedical, life and social science discipline, such as the use of structural equation modeling in psychology, survival models in oncology, and manifold learning in ecology. We discuss the implications of these findings for education in statistics and research methods, as well as within- and cross-disciplinary collaboration."

Biotelemetry is an essential methodology for reptiles as it compensates for several limitations when studying their natural history.

We assessed 290 English-language reptile home range studies published from 2000-2019 via a structured literature review investigating publications study location, taxonomic group, methodology, reporting, and analytical techniques. Substantial biases remain in both location and taxonomic groups in the literature, with nearly half of all studies (45%) originating from the USA. Snakes were most often studied, and crocodiles were least often studied, while testudines tended to have the greatest within study sample sizes. More than half of all studies lacked critical methodological details, limiting the number of studies for inclusion in future meta-analyses (55% of studies lacked information on individual tracking durations, and 51% lacked sufficient information on the number of times researchers recorded positions). Studies continue to rely on outdated methods to quantify space-use (including Minimum Convex Polygons and Kernel Density Estimators), often failing to report subtleties on decisions that have substantial impact on home range area estimates. Moving forward researchers can select a suite of appropriate analytical techniques tailored to their research question (dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement Models for within sample interpolation, and autocorrelated Kernel Density Estimators for beyond sample extrapolation). Only 1.4% of all evaluated studies linked to available and usable telemetry data, further hindering scientific consensus. We ultimately implore herpetologists to adopt transparent reporting practices and make liberal use of open data platforms to maximize progress in the field of reptile spatial ecology."

After reviewing the timing of the emergence of the pandemic in 2020 and the growth of governmental responses, available secondary sources are used to highlight impacts of COVID-19 on scientific research. A bibliometric analysis is then undertaken to analyze developments in COVID-19 related scientific publications through to October of 2020 by broad trends, fields, countries, and organizations. Two publication data sources are used: PubMed and the Web of Science.

While there has been a massive absolute increase in PubMed and Web of Science papers directly focused on COVID-19 topics, especially in medical, biological science, and public health fields, this is still a relatively small proportion of publication outputs across all fields of science. Using Web of Science publication data, the paper examines the extent to which researchers across all fields of science have pivoted their research outputs to focus on topics related to COVID-19. A COVID-19 research pivot is defined as the extent to which the proportion of output in a particular research field has shifted to a focus on COVID-19 topics in 2020 (to date) compared with 2019. Significant variations are found by specific fields (identified by Web of Science Subject Categories). In a top quintile of fields, not only in medical specialties, biomedical sciences, and public health but also in subjects in social sciences and arts and humanities, there are relatively high to medium research pivots. In lower quintiles, including other subjects in science, social science, and arts and humanities, low to zero COVID-19 research pivoting is identified.

The study aimed to fill this research gap by examining the relationship between acculturation stressors and academic adjustment among Nepalese international students in South Korean higher education institutions.

MethodsThe sample of the study consisted of Nepalese international students who enrolled in 36 universities in South Korea. Students background characteristics and acculturation stressors (e.g., discrimination, homesickness, hate/rejection, fear, cultural shock, and guilt) were selected to assess the association of these characteristics and stressors with academic adjustment. Pearson correlation and hierarchical multiple regression were utilized to examine the association between acculturation stressors and academic adjustment.

ResultsThe results from the Pearson correlation revealed the negative correlation of perceived discrimination (r = -.23, p< 0.01), perceived hate/rejection (r = -.18, p< 0.05), perceived fear (r = -.24, p< 0.01), and perceived cultural shock (r = -.17, p< 0.05) with academic adjustment. Further, the hierarchical regression model revealed that marital status ({beta} = .223, p <.01) had a positive association with academic adjustment, whereas perceived fear ({beta} = -.206, p <.05) had a negative association with academic adjustment even after including students background characteristics and other acculturation stressors.

ConclusionAddressing acculturation stressors among international students in higher education institutions is essential to facilitate positive academic adjustment. Mainly, perceived fear has negatively affected students academic adjustment. Based on these findings, tailored programs must be developed to curtail students perceived fear in order to enhance their academic performance in South Korean higher education institutions."

F.",Eric F Donaldson,2020-12-09,scientific communication and education,"For regulatory submissions of next generation sequencing (NGS) data it is vital for the analysis workflow to be robust, reproducible, and understandable. This project demonstrates that the use of the IEEE 2791-2020 Standard, (BioCompute objects [BCO]) enables complete and concise communication of NGS data analysis results. One arm of a clinical trial was replicated using synthetically generated data made to resemble real biological data. Two separate, independent analyses were then carried out using BCOs as the tool for communication of analysis: one to simulate a pharmaceutical regulatory submission to the FDA, and another to simulate the FDA review. The two results were compared and tabulated for concordance analysis: of the 118 simulated patient samples generated, the final results of 117 (99.15%) were in agreement. This high concordance rate demonstrates the ability of a BCO, when a verification kit is included, to effectively capture and clearly communicate NGS analyses within regulatory submissions. BCO promotes transparency and induces reproducibility, thereby reinforcing trust in the regulatory submission process."

P.; McDevitt, A.; Murray, J.; Barry, J.; Agung, F.; Muttaqin, E.; Mariani, S.",Andhika Prima Prasetyo,2020-12-10,scientific communication and education,"Indonesian marine resources are among the richest on the planet, sustaining highly diverse fisheries and includes the largest elasmobranch landings in the world, making Indonesia one of the worlds largest exporters of shark and ray products. Socio-economic and food security considerations pertaining to Indonesian communities add further layers of complexity to the management and conservation of these vulnerable species. This study investigates how shark and ray trade flows in and out of Indonesia and attempts to examine patterns and drivers of the current scenario. We identify substantial discrepancies between reported landings and declared exports, and between Indonesian exports in shark fin and meat products and the corresponding figures reported by importing countries. These mismatches are estimated to amount to over $43.6M and $20.9M for fins and meat, respectively, for the period between 2012 and 2018. Although the declared exports are likely to be an underestimation because of significant unreported or illegal trading activities, we find that domestic consumption of shark and ray products plays a significant role in explaining these discrepancies due to the increasing local demand for meat. The study also unearths a general scenario of unsystematic data collection and lack of granularity of product terminology, which is inadequate to meet the challenges of over-exploitation, illegal trade and food security in Indonesia. We discuss how to improve data transparency to support trade regulations and governance actions, by improving inspection measures, and conserving elasmobranch populations without neglecting the socio-economic dimension of this complex system."

Muindi,2020-12-10,scientific communication and education,"Fundamentally, science is about people. The stories of the people behind the science are just as important as the results themselves, even though the results are often what get more attention. Despite the growth of databases storing such stories across diverse mediums, a detailed assessment of those databases is missing. To continue innovating science storytelling, we provide the first assessment of the structure and diversity of the narratives published in the Journal of Stories in Science. In this assessment, a total of 170 published stories authored by 158 authors between 2016 and 2020 are analyzed. Majority (67%) of the authors are women from North America and in the life sciences. The narratives most commonly feature authors from academia (e.g., 23% graduate students, 13% post-doctoral fellows and 21% professors). However, there is also a growing number of authors with PhDs that are working outside of academia (15%). Nearly a quarter (23%) of the database authors come from racial groups (African American, Latino, and Hispanic) that have been shown to be underrepresented in health-related sciences in the United States. Using the industry standard Flesch Reading Ease Score, we found that 74% of the stories included in the analysis fall in the target range of 50-70, which represents readability by students in grades 8-12. The analysis here provides the first deep look into one of the databases publishing diverse stories in science using a wide range of mediums. In summary, there is a need for more emphasis on both expanding and studying such databases given the continuous demand for these stories and their inclusion into K-12 curriculums."

They allow the reader to trace the flow of evidence, serving as a gateway to relevant literature. Most scientists are aware of citations errors, but few appreciate the prevalence or consequences of these problems. The purpose of this study was to examine how often frequently cited papers in biomedical scientific literature are cited inaccurately. The study included an active participation of first authors of frequently cited papers; to first-hand verify the citations accuracy. The approach was to determine most cited original articles and their parent authors, that could be able to access, and identify, collect and review all citations of their original work. Findings from feasibility study, where we collected and reviewed 1,540 articles containing 2,526 citations of 14 most cited articles in which the 1st authors were affiliated with the Faculty of Medicine University of Belgrade, were further evaluated for external confirmation in an independent verification set of articles. Verification set included 4,912 citations identified in 2,995 articles that cited 13 most cited articles published by authors affiliated with the Mayo Clinic Division of Nephrology and Hypertension (Rochester, Minnesota, USA), whose research focus is hypertension and peripheral vascular disease. Most cited articles and their citations were determined according to SCOPUS database search. A citation was defined as being accurate if the cited article supported or was in accordance with the statement by citing authors. A multilevel regression model for binary data was used to determine predictors of inaccurate citations. At least one inaccurate citation was found in 11% and 15% of articles in the feasibility study and verification set, respectively, suggesting that inaccurate citations are common in biomedical literature. The main findings were similar in both sets. The most common problem was the citation of nonexistent findings (38.4%), followed by an incorrect interpretation of findings (15.4%). One fifth of inaccurate citations were due to ""chains of inaccurate citations,"" in which inaccurate citations appeared to have been copied from previous papers. Reviews, longer time elapsed from publication to citation, and multiple citations were associated with higher chance of citation being inaccurate. Based on these findings, several actions that authors, mentors and journals can take to reduce citation inaccuracies and maintain the integrity of the scientific literature have been proposed."

L.",Andrew Joseph Mongue,2020-12-11,scientific communication and education,"Most people meet insects with fear and disgust but this reputation is largely unfounded, as few insects pose health risks. In fact, many are beneficial and their absence would adversely affect human life; thus insect conservation is important but unpopular. We have begun addressing these concerns as part of a broader effort to establish an ongoing outreach partnership between graduate students at the University of Kansas and the Girl Scouts of Northeast Kansas/Northwest Missouri. To explore ways to advocate for insect conservation, we held an insect collecting activity at a Girl Scout summer camp and surveyed changes in attitudes towards insects afterwards. This activity positively changed reactions to insect encounters and increased confidence in identifying harmful insects but did not strongly reduce fears or increase curiosity towards insects. Beyond these proximate results, this project highlights the potential of Girl Scout troops as targets for informal science education that can benefit both academics and the broader community."

P.; Thapa, B.; Bhandary, S.",Om  Prakash  Poudel,2020-12-14,scientific communication and education,"IntroductionForeign employment is the most significant motivation for international migration in Nepal. However, migrant workers are vulnerable to many exploitations that lead to psychological distress during the pre-departure phase and at the destination. The study aimed to identify the prevalence and associated factors for psychological distress among migrant workers during the pre-departure phase.

MethodsThis was a cross-sectional study based on the representative sample of 445 migrant workers. A 21-item Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) and Pre-Departure Risk Factors Perception Scale (PD-RFPS) at the workplace were self-administered to migrant workers selected randomly attending the pre-departure orientation program. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify the associated factors.

ResultsPrevalence of psychological distress (Depression, Anxiety and Stress) was identified as 20.9% and female (AOR=2.02, p-value=0.041) and perception of bad working conditions (AOR=2.44, p-value=0.046) were found significantly associated with pre-departure psychological distress.

ConclusionData suggests the presence of symptoms of psychological distress among migrant workers during the pre-departure phase and perception of risk factors at the workplace were found significantly associated with pre-departure psychological distress. Concern bodies should provide in-depth orientation on possible risk factors at the destination and coping skills for psychological distress during the pre-departure orientation program."

Objectives of this study was to find the prevalence of corporal punishment in schools and the knowledge, perceptions and actions in the children.

MethodsA community based cross sectional descriptive study done among school students from Jaffna district using a pretested questionnaire containing 40 questions. Multistage stratified proportionate cluster sampling was used to recruit the students. Scoring systems were used to determine the knowledge and perception of Corporal-punishment. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 20.

ResultsA total of 1130 students were recruited with mean age of 17.58{+/-}0.5y. A total of 687(60.7%) said they received some form of corporal punishment at least once during the school term. Physical punishment (64.5%) was common followed by psychological (27.1%). Teachers (54.8%) were the main group involved in corporal-punishment. Mean score for the knowledge was 11.11 and a good knowledge score was seen in 37.3% of the students. Participants with good knowledge favored law against it (p value<0.05), take legal action (P value<0.05) and supported complete prohibition of it (P value<0.05). Nearly 2% (n=22) had good perception and 40.8% (n=461) had a more positive perception. Majority (86.3%) preferred an alternative way of discipline and felt it was detrimental to the future (89.5%).

ConclusionCorporal-punishment was experienced by majority of the students in school and the students were aware that it was illegal and those with good knowledge were willing to take legal action."

Competition frameworkin order to improve and promote the ongoing training of the Brazilian bioinformatics community, we organize a national competition, with the main goal to develop human resources and abilities in Computational Biology at the national level. The competition framework was designed in three phases: 1) a one-day challenge composed of 60 multiple-choice questions covering Biology, Computer Science, and Bioinformatics knowledge; 2) five Computational Biology challenges to be solved in three days; and 3) development of an original project evaluated during the 15th X-meeting.

Resultsthe first edition of the League of Brazilian Bioinformatics (LBB) counted 168 competitors and 59 groups, distributed into undergraduate students (14.4%), graduate students (12.6% master and 16.8%, Ph.D.), and other professional fields. The first phase selected 46 teams to proceed in the competition, while the second phase selected the three top-performing teams.

Conclusionduring the competition, we were able to stimulate teamwork in the main areas of Bioinformatics, with the engagement of all research-level competitors. Furthermore, we identified opportunities to deliver and offer better training to the community and we intend to apply the acquired experience in the second edition of the LBB, which will occur in 2021.

Singh,2020-12-21,scientific communication and education,"This article constructs a restricted infection rate inverse binomial-based approach to predict COVID-19 cases after a family gathering. The traditional inverse binomial (IB) model is unqualified to match the reality of COVID-19, because the data contradicts the models requirement that variance should be greater than expected value. A refined version of the IB model is a necessity to predict COVID-19 cases after family gatherings. Our refined version of an IB model is more appropriate and versatile, as it accommodates all potential data scenarios: equal, lesser, or greater variance than expected value.

Application of the approach is based on a restricted infectivity rate and methodology on Fan et al.s COVID-19 data, which exhibits two clusters of infectivity. Cluster 1 has a smaller number of primary cases and exhibits larger variance than the expected cases with a negative correlation of 28%, implying that the number of secondary cases is lesser when the number of primary cases increases and vice versa. The traditional inverse binomial (IB) model is appropriate for Cluster 1. The probability of contracting COVID-19 is estimated to be 0.13 among the primary, but is 0.75 among the secondary in Cluster 1, with a wider gap. Conversely, Cluster 2, exhibits smaller variance than the expected cases with a correlation of 79%, implying the number of primary and secondary cases increase or decrease together. Cluster 2 disqualifies the traditional IB model and demands its refined version. Probability of contracting COVID-19 is estimated to be 0.74 among the primary, but is 0.72 among the secondary in Cluster 2, with a narrower gap.

The models ability to estimate the communitys health system memory for future policies to be developed is an asset of this approach. The current hazard level to be infected with COVID-19 among the primary and secondary groups are estimable and interpretable.

Author SummaryCurrent statistical models are not able to accurately predict disease infection spread in the COVID-19 pandemic. We have applied a widely-used inverse binomial method to predict rates of infection after small gatherings, going from primary (original) cases to secondary (later) cases after family gatherings or social events, using the data from the Wuhan and Gansu provinces in China, where the virus first spread. The advantages of the proposed approach include that the models ability to estimate the communitys health system memory for future policies to be developed, as such policies might reduce COVIDs spread if not its control. In our approach, as demonstrated, the current hazard level of becoming infected with COVID-19 and the odds of contracting COVID-19 among the primary in comparison to the secondary groups are estimable and interpretable. We hope the proposed approach will be used in future epidemics."
10.1101/2020.12.21.423763,Calibration of models to data: a comparison of methods,"Suboi, Z.; Hladish, T. J.; Delva, W.; Hazelbag, C. M.",Zenabu  Suboi,2020-12-21,scientific communication and education,"Complex models are often fitted to data using simulation-based calibration, a computationally challenging process. Several calibration methods to improve computational efficiency have been developed with no consensus on which methods perform best. We did a simulation study comparing the performance of 5 methods that differed in their Goodness-of-Fit (GOF) metrics and parameter search strategies. Posterior densities for two parameters of a simple Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered epidemic model were obtained for each calibration method under two scenarios. Scenario 1 (S1) allowed 60K model runs and provided two target statistics, whereas scenario 2 (S2) allowed 75K model runs and provided three target statistics. For both scenarios, we obtained reference posteriors against which we compare all other methods by running Rejection ABC for 5M parameter combinations, retaining the 0.1% best. We assessed performance by applying a 2D-grid to all posterior densities and quantifying the percentage overlap with the reference posterior.

We considered basic and adaptive sampling calibration methods. Of the basic calibration methods, Bayesian calibration (Bc) Sampling Importance Resampling (S1: 34.8%, S2: 39.8%) outperformed Rejection Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) (S1: 2.3%, S2: 1.8%). Among the adaptive sampling methods, Bc Incremental Mixture Importance Sampling (S1: 72.7%, S2: 85.5%) outperformed sequential Monte Carlo ABC (AbcSmc) (S1: 53.9%, S2: 72.9%) and Sequential ABC (S1: 21.6%, S2: 62.7%).

Basic methods led to sub-optimal calibration results. Methods using the surrogate Likelihood as a GOF outperformed methods using a distance measure. Adaptive sampling methods were more efficient compared to their basic counterparts and resulted in accurate posterior distributions. BcIMIS was the best performing method. When three rather than two target statistics were available, the difference in performance between the adaptive sampling methods was less pronounced. Although BcIMIS outperforms the other methods, limitations related to the target statistics and available computing infrastructure may warrant the choice of an alternative method.

Author summaryAs mathematical models become more realistic, they tend to become more complex. Calibration, the process of tuning a model to better reproduce empirical data, can become dramatically more computationally intensive as model complexity increases. Researchers have responded by developing a range of more efficient, adaptive sampling calibration methods. However, the relative performance of these calibration methods remains unclear. To this end, we quantified the performance of five commonly used calibration methods. We found that adaptive sampling methods were more efficient compared to their basic counterparts and resulted in more accurate posterior distributions. We identified the best performing method, but caution that limitations related to the target statistics and available computing infrastructure may warrant the choice of one of the alternatives. Finally, we provide the code used to apply the calibration methods in our study as a primer to facilitate their application."

There is a need to increase the number of experts in our education sector who can synthesise, translate, and package the evidence for ready use by decision-makers and to foster entrepreneurship in Africa. To achieve this, the activities of a 28-man Evidence Leaders in Africa (ELA) team were recruited to drive the project through capacity building training and workshop sessions. Thereafter, a non-random purposive sampling technique targeted at policy makers at various government and non-governmental organizations was adopted as the study design. In all, purposive administration of 424 copies of questionnaire to individuals in different governmental and non-governmental organizations was done by the recruited personnel. The retrieved data from the questionnaire were analyzed using standard statistical method. Socio-demographic characteristics of respondents reveal 34% representation of (31-40 years) age bracket, with (57%) of them working in the University spanning over 2 to 5years (47%) work experience. Approximately 64% of the respondents are not aware of EIDM while 71% had no understanding of EIDM. As regards knowledge of EIDM, 36% had no knowledge of EIDM, 29% had moderate knowledge, 34% were beginners while approximately 1% had advanced knowledge of EIDM. Also, approximately 99% of the respondents have neither been trained nor involved in training others in EIDM. It was also observed that 8.5% of the respondents were policy-makers in the organization, yet 90.7% of the respondents agree that EIDM is useful in policy-making while 81.3% of the respondents engage their colleagues in EIDM. From this study, it is safe to infer that institutionalizing EIDM in NNMDA has numerous benefits as shown by the findings of this study. This will only be possible when all parties involved in producing and using research evidence are well informed and knowledgeable in EIDM."

With the challenge of delivering quality education through a computer screen, we validated and applied an online course model using active teaching tools for higher education. We incorporated published active-learning strategies into an online construct, with problem-based inquiry and design of inquiry research projects to serve as our core active-learning tool. The gains related to students science learning experiences and their attitudes towards science were assessed by applying questionnaires before, during and after the course. The course counted on the participation of 83 students, most of them (60,8%) from post-graduate students. Our results show that engagement provided by active learning methods can improve performance both in hard and soft skills. Students participation seems to be more relevant when activities require interaction of information, prediction and reasoning, such as open-ended questions and design of research projects. Therefore, our data shows that, in pandemic, active learning tools benefit students and improve their critical thinking and their motivation and positive positioning in science."

C.; Staniscuaski, F.",Fernanda  Staniscuaski,2020-12-23,scientific communication and education,"Despite the progress observed in recent years, women are still underrepresented in science worldwide, especially at top positions. Many factors contribute to women progressively leaving academia at different stages of their career, including motherhood, harassment and conscious and unconscious discrimination. Implicit bias plays a major negative role in recognition, promotions and career advancement of female scientists. Recently, a rank on the most influential scientists in the world was created based on several metrics, including the number of published papers and citations. Here, we analyzed the representation of Brazilian scientists in this rank, focusing on gender. Female Brazilian scientists are greatly underrepresented in the rank (11% in the Top 100,000; 18% in the Top 2%). Male scientists have more self-citation than female scientists and positions in the rank varied when self-citations were included, suggesting that self-citation by male scientists increases their visibility. Moreover, male scientists had more papers never cited than female scientists. Possible reasons for this observed scenario are related to the metrics used to rank scientists, since these metrics reproduce and amplify the well-known implicit bias in peer-review and citations. Discussions on the repercussions of such ranks are pivotal to avoid deepening the gender gap in science."

We use text mining of scholarly articles to characterize the interdisciplinary field of Biosecurity and the uses of this term over the past 35 years; a context evolution model is built to describe major changes in this field, and it shows a progression toward health security in recent years. Understanding the shifts in discourse predominance helps to illuminate the major challenges facing biosecurity research and academic community, and contributes to enhancing communication across disciplines within the Biosecurity field."

B.; Jaquess, D.",Chris  Gunter,2021-01-05,scientific communication and education,"As a high prevalence disorder with limited information about etiology, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been marked by confusion and miscommunication around its causes and treatments. To promote high-quality science communication, we participated in a local science festival, both providing information about the brain and ASD and asking passersby questions about their knowledge of ASD. We then asked the booth staffers to evaluate the program and conducted qualitative analyses of public and staffer responses. Public responses to the question ""what would you like to know about autism?"" most often concerned how the disorder was diagnosed or defined. In contrast, public responses to the question ""what would you like others to know about autism?"" centered around educating those unaffected by ASD on how to improve interactions and awareness, mentioning inclusivity and intersectionality, and dispelling negative stereotypes. The staffers overwhelmingly reported that in future years, they would include even more science and allow for more in-depth conversations with interested parties, as well as bringing materials in other languages. These responses are in keeping with a trend for more inclusive science communication, particularly in the field of behavioral health and ASD, and a desire to challenge myths around the condition. We conclude that our science festival interactions brought multiple benefits to public and staff."

G.",Andres G Vidal-Gadea,2021-01-05,scientific communication and education,"For decades the nematode C. elegans has served as an outstanding research organism owing to its unsurpassed experimental amenability. This advantage has also made this tiny worm an attractive vehicle for science instruction across higher learning institutions. However, the prohibitive cost associated with the automated behavioral assessment of these animals remains an obstacle preventing their full adoption in undergraduate and high school settings. To improve this situation, we developed an inexpensive worm tracking system for use by high school interns and undergraduate students. Over the past two years this tracker has been successfully used by undergraduate students in our introductory Cell and Molecular lab (BSC220) at Illinois State University. Here we describe and demonstrate the use of our inexpensive worm tracking system."

D.; Magazi, I.; Zaman, R.",Sophie  Witter,2021-01-05,scientific communication and education,"Most countries face challenges attracting and retaining health staff in remote areas but this is especially acute in fragile and shock-prone contexts, like Guinea, where imbalances in staffing are high and financial and governance arrangements to address rural shortfalls are weak.

The objective of this study was to understand how health staff could be better motivated to work and remain in rural, under-served areas in Guinea. In order to inform the policy dialogue on strengthening human resources for health, we conducted three nationally representative cross-sectional surveys, adapted from tools used in other fragile contexts.

We found that the locational job preferences of health workers in Guinea are particularly influenced by opportunities for training, working conditions, and housing. Most staff are satisfied with their work and with supervision, however, financial aspects and working conditions are considered least satisfactory, and worrying findings include the high proportion of staff favouring emigration, their high tolerance of informal user payments, as well as their limited exposure to rural areas during training.

Based on our findings, we highlight measures which could improve rural recruitment and retention in Guinea and similar settings. These include offering upgrading and specialization in return for rural service; providing greater exposure to rural areas during training; increasing recruitment from rural areas; experimenting with fixed term contracts in rural areas; and improving working conditions in rural posts. The development of incentive packages should be accompanied by action to tackle wider issues, such as reforms to training and staff management."

Singh,2021-01-06,scientific communication and education,"In this paper, heterogeneity is formally defined, and its properties are explored. We define and distinguish observable versus non-observable heterogeneity. It is proposed that heterogeneity among the vulnerable is a significant factor in the contagion impact of COVID-19, as demonstrated with incidence rates on a Diamond Princess Cruise ship in February 2020. Given the nature of the disease, its heterogeneity and human social norms, pre-voyage and post-voyage quick testing procedures may become the new standard for cruise ship passengers and crew. The technological advances in testing available today would facilitate more humanistic treatment as compared to more archaic quarantine and isolation practices for all onboard ship. With quick testing, identification of those infected and thus not allowed to embark on a cruise or quarantining those disembarking and other mitigation strategies, the popular cruise adventure could be available safely again. Whatever the procedures implemented, the methodological purpose of this study should add valuable insight in the modeling of disease and specifically, the COVID-19 virus."

G.",Floyd A Reed,2021-01-08,scientific communication and education,"Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) are emerging as a means to engage large numbers of undergraduate students in meaningful inquiry-based research activities. We describe here a simple laboratory exercise as part of an undergraduate genetics course that illustrates the contributions of oncogenes and tumor suppressors to the formation of neoplasms in an invertebrate model system. In addition, students were challenged to investigate whether flies reared on a diet containing a variety of additives display a higher number of invasive tumors in the larval abdomen.

The goal of the exercise was to (i) familiarize students with the multigenic origin of the cancer phenotype, to (ii) introduce some of the fundamental molecular cancer hallmarks, and to (iii) highlight the significance of invertebrate model systems in biomedical research. Furthermore, (iv) students learn to execute a molecular test for transgenic produce and (v) apply statistical tools to test a simple hypothesis.

We evaluated student learning and changes in opinions and attitudes relating to environmental versus genetic causes of cancer and several common misconceptions using a questionnaire before and after completing the exercise.

Overall, significant improvements in the rate of factually correct responses and reductions in uncertainty were demonstrated. Although resistance to change was apparent in regard to identifying some risk factors, there was clear learning and understanding of the core concepts of carcinogenesis and the utility of basic research with model organisms."
10.1101/2021.01.10.426070,High school science fair: Experiences of undergraduate bioscience majors,"Grinnell, F.; Dalley, S.; Reisch, J.",Frederick  Grinnell,2021-01-11,scientific communication and education,"Science fairs offer potential opportunities for students to learn first-hand about the practices of science. Over the past six years we have been carrying out voluntary and anonymous surveys with regional and national groups of high school and post high school students to learn about their high school science fair experiences regarding help received, obstacles encountered, and opinions about the value and impact of science fair. Understanding what students think about science fairs will help educators make science fairs more effective learning opportunities. In this paper, we focus on the findings with two national groups of post high school students - undergraduate research fellows (SURF students) who did research at UT Southwestern Medical Center during 2014-2019 and undergraduates biology students attending the 2019 Howard Hughes Medical Institute Science Education Alliance (SEA) summer symposium. About 25% of the students who completed surveys indicated that they had participated in high school science fair, but more than half attended high schools where science fairs were unavailable. Effectively, 6 out of every 10 students participated in science fair if available. Students who could have participated in high school science fair but chose not to do so identified not enough time and coming up with their project idea as major reasons why not. About half the SURF students favored requiring non-competitive science fair regardless whether they themselves had participated in science fair. On the other hand, less than 1 in 5 thought that competitive science fair should be required. Introduction to the scientific process and general learning were mentioned most frequently as the reasons to require non-competitive science fair; these reasons were mentioned rarely in connection with competitive science fair. Unlike the national cohort of high school students we surveyed previously, who mostly did science fair in 9th and 10th grades, SURF students participated in science fair throughout high school and were twice as likely as high school students to have carried out science fair more than once. In conclusion, our findings suggest that participation of the undergraduate bioscience majors in high school science fairs occurs far more frequently than recognized previously. The findings emphasize further the importance of incentivizing rather than requiring science fair participation, especially in 9th and 10th grades, and the potential value of developing non-competitive science fairs."

Here we use a systematic approach using Scopus to generate a comprehensive country-level database of all scientists in Greece. Moreover, we expand that database to include also Greek diaspora scientists. The database that we have compiled includes 63951 scientists who have published at least 5 papers indexed in Scopus. Of those, 35116 have an affiliation in Greece. We validate the sensitivity and specificity of the database against different control sets of scientists. We also analyze the scientific disciplines of these scientists according to the Science Metrix classification (174 subfield disciplines) and provide detailed data on each of the 63951 scientists using multiple citation indicators and a composite thereof. These analyses demonstrate differential concentrations in specific subfields for the local versus the diaspora cohorts, as well as an advantage of the diaspora cohort in terms of citation indicators especially among top-impact researchers. The approach that we have taken can be applied to map also the scientific workforce of other countries and nations for evaluation, planning and policy purposes."

A multi-disciplinary and multi-stakeholder perspective on causes, effects and potential policy implications","Severin, A.; Chataway, J.",Anna  Severin,2021-01-16,scientific communication and education,"Peer review of manuscripts is labour-intensive and time-consuming. Individual reviewers often feel themselves overburdened with the amount of reviewing they are requested to do. Aiming to explore how stakeholder groups perceive reviewing burden and what they believe to be the causes of a potential overburdening of reviewers, we conducted focus groups with early-, mid-, and senior career scholars, editors, and publishers. By means of a thematic analysis, we aimed to identify the causes of overburdening of reviewers. First, we show that, across disciplines and roles, stakeholders believed that the reviewing workload has become so enormous that the academic community is no longer able to supply the reviewing resources necessary to address its demand for peer review. Second, the reviewing workload is distributed unequally across the academic community, thereby overwhelming small groups of scholars. Third, stakeholders believed the overburdening of reviewers to be caused by (i) an increase in manuscript submissions; (ii) insufficient editorial triage; (iii) a lack of reviewing instructions; (iv) difficulties in recruiting reviewers; (v) inefficiencies in manuscript handling and (vi) a lack of institutionalisation of peer review. These themes were assumed to mutually reinforce each other and to relate to an inadequate incentive structure in academia that favours publications over peer review. In order to alleviate reviewing burden, a holistic approach is required that addresses both the increased demand for and the insufficient supply of reviewing resources."
10.1101/2021.01.14.426384,An open-source tool to assess the carbon footprint of research,"Mariette, J.; Blanchard, O.; Berne, O.; Ben Ari, T.",Olivier  Berne,2021-01-16,scientific communication and education,"The scrutiny over the carbon footprint of academics has increased rapidly in the last few years. This has resulted in a series of publications providing various estimates of the carbon footprint of one or several research activities, principally at the scale of a university or a research center or, more recently, a field of research. The variety of tools or methodologies - on which these estimates rely - unfortunately prevents from any direct comparison because of the sensitivity of carbon footprint assessments to variations in the scope and to key parameters such as emission factors. In an effort to enabling a robust comparison of research carbon footprints across institutions, contexts or disciplines, we present an open-source web application, GES 1point5 designed to estimate the carbon footprint of a department, research lab or team in any country of the world with a transparent and common methodology. The current version of GES 1point5, open-source and freely available, takes into account the most common and often predominant emission sources in research labs: buildings, digital devices, commuting, and professional travel. GES 1point5 is developed by an interdisciplinary team of scientists from several public research institutions in France as part of the Labos 1point5 project. GES 1point5 is therefore presently tailored for the French context but can be adjusted to any national contexts by adjusting the values of emission factors. The versatility and usability of the software have been empirically validated by its adoption by several hundred research labs in France over the last 18 months. In addition to enabling the estimation and monitoring of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at the scale of a research lab, GES 1point5 is designed to aggregate the data entered by the labs and the corresponding GHG emissions estimates into a comprehensive database. GES 1point5 can therefore allow to (i) identify robust determinants of the carbon footprint of research activities across a network of research labs (ii) estimate the carbon footprint of research at the national scale. A preliminary analysis of the carbon footprint of more than one hundred laboratories is presented to illustrate the potential of the approach. While assessments of carbon footprints are often externalized onto extension services and proprietary softwares, GES 1point5 is designed as a hands-on, pedagogic and transparent tool for research labs to monitor and reduce their own carbon footprint. This internalization has strong positive co-benefits for academics in terms of awareness and empowerment. We further expect that international dissemination of GES 1point5 will contribute to establishing a global understanding of the drivers of the research carbon footprint worldwide and an identification of the levers to decrease it.

J.",Kiran  Musunuru,2021-01-18,scientific communication and education,"We assessed the efficacy of traditional lectures versus online modules with respect to student learning in an undergraduate introductory biochemistry course in two successive years. In the first year, students had the options of attending live lectures by the course instructor and viewing online modules pre-recorded by the instructor, with the lectures and modules covering identical content; in addition, all students had a mandatory weekly application session. Utilizing pre-course and post-course tests as an instrument with which to measure learning during the course, we observed significantly increased learning (0.7 standard deviations) with attendance of traditional lectures and decreased learning with use of online modules, even after adjustment for grade point average. In the second year, the course had the same curriculum, but students were randomized to either live lectures or online modules for the first half of the course, crossing over to the other modality during the second half. With randomization, no difference in learning was observed between the two groups. Furthermore, we found that students self-reported greater engagement when viewing online modules than when attending lectures in person. These findings suggest some aspects of the lecture experience can be shifted to online modules in STEM courses without impacts on student learning so as to use classroom time more fully for application-based active learning interventions."

METHODSThis retrospective cohort study included 43,267 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the Veterans Health Administration between 03/01/20 and 08/31/20 and followed until 09/30/20. We focused our analysis on patients that were subsequently hospitalized, and categorized them into groups based on the month of hospitalization. We summarized our findings through descriptive statistics. We used a nonparametric rank-sum test for trend to examine any differences in the distribution of our study variables across the six months.

RESULTSDuring our study period, 8,240 patients were hospitalized, and 1,081 (13.1%) died within 30 days of admission. Hospitalizations increased over time, but the proportion of patients that died consistently declined from March (N=221/890, 24.8%) to August (N=111/1,396, 8.0%). Patients hospitalized in March compared to August were younger on average, mostly black, and symptomatic. They also had a higher frequency of baseline comorbidities, including hypertension and diabetes, and were more likely to present with abnormal laboratory findings including low lymphocyte counts and elevated creatinine. Lastly, receipt of mechanical ventilation and Hydroxychloroquine declined from March to August, while treatment with Dexamethasone and Remdesivir increased.

CONCLUSIONWe found evidence of declining COVID-19 severity and fatality over time within a national health care system."

Multiple groups have produced recommendations for functions that biomedical repositories should support, with many using requirements of the FAIR data principles as guidelines. However, FAIR is but one set of principles that has arisen out of the open science community. They are joined by principles governing open science, data citation and trustworthiness, all of which are important aspects for biomedical data repositories to support. Together, these define a framework for data repositories that we call OFCT: Open, FAIR, Citable and Trustworthy. Here we developed an instrument using the open source PolicyModels toolkit that attempts to operationalize key aspects of OFCT principles and piloted the instrument by evaluating eight biomedical community repositories listed by the NIDDK Information Network (dkNET.org). Repositories included both specialist repositories that focused on a particular data type or domain, in this case diabetes and metabolomics, and generalist repositories that accept all data types and domains. The goal of this work was both to obtain a sense of how much the design of current biomedical data repositories align with these principles and to augment the dkNET listing with additional information that may be important to investigators trying to choose a repository, e.g., does the repository fully support data citation? The evaluation was performed from March to November 2020 through inspection of documentation and interaction with the sites by the authors. Overall, although there was little explicit acknowledgement of any of the OFCT principles in our sample, the majority of repositories provided at least some support for their tenets."

We observe the emergence of a new category of preprint authors working in the fields of immunology, microbiology, infectious diseases, and epidemiology, who extensively used preprint platforms during the pandemic for sharing their immediate findings. The majority of these findings were works-in-progress unfitting for a prompt acceptance by refereed journals. The COVID-19 preprints that became peer-reviewed journal articles were often submitted to journals concurrently with the posting on a preprint server, and the entire publication cycle, from preprint to the online journal article, took on average 63 days. This included an expedited peer-review process of 43 days and journals production stage of 15 days, however there was a wide variation in publication delays between journals. Only one third of COVID-19 preprints posted during the first nine months of the pandemic appeared as peer-reviewed journal articles. These journal articles display high Altmetric Attention Scores further emphasizing a significance of COVID-19 research during 2020.

This was particularly disruptive for those taking end of school examinations in preparation for higher education. Biological science courses require students to absorb a lot of new vocabulary and concepts, with examinations traditionally focusing on content recall rather than reasoning. Students who had entered university in September 2019 were compared with those arriving in September 2020 with respect to their knowledge of bioscience vocabulary and understanding of key concepts. Results showed no significant difference between those who had gone through the examination process in 2019 relative to those who had not, in 2020. This suggests the cramming of information for examinations has no detectable effect on the knowledge and understanding of biology that students take with them to university."

Data science training for students in higher education necessitates well-equipped and confident instructors across curricula. However, not all instructors are versed in data science skills or research-based teaching practices. Our study sought to survey the state of data science education across institutions of higher learning, identify instructor needs, and illuminate barriers to teaching data science in the classroom. We distributed a survey to instructors around the world, focused on the United States, and received 106 complete responses. Our results indicate that instructors across institutions use, teach, and view data management, analysis, and visualization as important for students to learn. Code, modeling, and reproducibility were less valued by instructors, although there were differences by institution type (doctoral, masters, or baccalaureate), and career stage (time since terminal degree). While there were a variety of barriers highlighted by respondents, instructor background, student background, and space in the curriculum were the greatest barriers of note. Interestingly, instructors were most interested in receiving training for how to teach code and data analysis in the undergraduate classroom. Our study provides an important window into how data science is taught in higher education as well as suggestions for how we can best move forward with empowering instructors across disciplines."

Ecoacoustics studies the sounds that emanates from the environments, by gaining insights of landscape dynamics from acoustic patterns and particularities at different places. With recent advance in technology, it is common to obtain sound datasets recorded 24-h a day for several months. The analysis of these long-term sound recordings represents several challenges. Investigators already involved in acoustic are familiar with signal processing methods, which are essential tools for sound analysis. However, in general beginners interested in Ecoacoustics do not share this background formation. The present work illustrates basic topics of digital signal processing in a comprehensible style, and an effective pipeline for long-term sound explorative data analysis (EDA) is presented. Finally, the described signal processing fundamentals are applied for EDA of 1-month underwater acoustic data recorded in a Brazilian marine protected area.

We modified Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY) equations for humans to PALYs to estimate the societal burden of animal diseases. We used a structured questionnaire to collect data on parameters that feed into PALY equations. We coded and entered data from questionnaires directly into Statistical Package of Social Sciences (IBM SPSS Version 20), and entered the estimated values of PALY parameters into Mathematical Calculus Software called Integral Calculator (https://www.integral-calculator.com/). We then used the integral calculator to calculate PALY equations, which we used to estimate the societal disease burden of ECF in cattle. PALYs calculations were done in three categories; PALYs without discounting and age weighting, PALYs with only discounting, and PALYs with discounting and age weighting.

Results revealed that the years of productivity lost by a cow, bull, and ox that suffered from ECF were estimated at 15, 10, and 15 years, respectively. In the second category, the years of productivity lost by a cow, bull, and ox were seven, six, and seven years, respectively. In the final category, the years of productivity lost by a cow, bull, and ox were five years.

ECF caused a total of 517,165 PALYs in Namwala District. The quality of life reduced in years due to disability (YLD) caused by ECF per cow, bull, and ox was 0.07, 0.07, and 0.02 percent of their life expectancy, respectively. The estimated values for the years of a lifetime lost due to mortality (YLL) caused by ECF were 35, 49, and 35 percent of the life expectancy per cow, bull, and ox. These results are important for measuring outcomes of animal health problems in terms of PALYs. The findings are helpful in future projections for the future burden of any disease and can be used as a basis in policy-making and decision-making, particularly on priorities in animal health research. We recommend that a classification of animal diseases of national economic importance should consider both the societal burden and economic impact instead of the common practice of only considering the economic impact."

Mentees gained knowledge and skills in various research areas including proposal writing, research methods, data analysis, report writing and research publication. Nine mentees gained their first research publication through the CARMS and three successfully completed their first grant proposal. Three mentees were supported by their mentor to develop PhD research proposals and five others gained skills that helped them secure paid research jobs. Eleven mentees have  graduated from the programme, seven of which are currently enrolled as trainee mentors. Mentees appreciated the opportunity to improve on their research skills and felt that the programme gave them a  safe environment to freely express their concerns.

Main challenges encountered were: difficulty finding suitable mentors, communication barriers, poorly defined mentorship goals, dealing with mentees lack of knowledge/experience of  basic research concepts and funding limitations. This programme had several positive impacts on the knowledge and skills of mentees and demonstrates the importance of mentorship in research capacity strengthening. Sustaining such programmes requires investments in training and development, to ensure that mentees are continuously and adequately supported."

Santangelo,2021-02-03,scientific communication and education,"Several studies have suggested that women in science are less productive than men, and that this gap contributes to their under-representation in the ranks of senior researchers. However, few studies have examined the role of mentoring, and in particular mentor gender, on the productivity of female scientists early in their careers. Such efforts are limited by the difficulties of unambiguously linking mentees to their mentors and measuring the research productivity resulting from those relationships. Here we use our novel author disambiguation solution to investigate the role of self-identified gender in mentorship of 12,932 trainees who either successfully or unsuccessfully applied to the National Institutes of Health for research fellowships between fiscal years 2011 and 2017, applying a multi-dimensional framework to assess productivity. We found that, after normalizing for the funding level of mentors, the productivity of female and male mentees is indistinguishable; it is also independent of the gender of the mentor, other than in measures of clinical impact, where women mentored by women outperform other mentee-mentor dyads."

We have surveyed 740 researchers of which 66% experienced a decrease in productivity, 50% indicated increased workload, and 66% reported they have been feeling internal pressure to make progress. Those whose research required physical presence in a lab or the field experienced considerable disruption and productivity decrease. About 82% of this group will try to permanently reduce their work dependency on physical presence. Parents and those taking care of vulnerable dependents have been spending less time on research due to their role conflict. We further observed a gender gap in the overall disruption consequences; more female researchers have been experiencing a reduction in productivity and external pressure to make progress. The results of this study can help institution leaders and policymakers better understand the pandemics challenges for the research community and motivate appropriate measures to instill long-term solutions."

We examined whether this index, complemented by the Gini index, could be useful for identifying cases of potential editorial bias, using a large sample of biomedical journals.

MethodsWe extracted metadata for all biomedical journals referenced in the National Library of Medicine, with any attributed Broad Subject Terms, and at least 50 authored (i.e. by at least one author) articles between 2015 and 2019, identifying the most prolific author (i.e. the person who signed the most papers in each particular journal). We calculated the PPMP and the 2015-2019 Gini index for the distribution of articles across authors. When the relevant information was reported, we also computed the median publication lag (time between submission and acceptance) for articles authored by any of the most prolific authors and that for articles not authored by prolific authors. For outlier journals, defined as a PPMP or Gini index above the 95th percentile of their respective distributions, a random sample of 100 journals was selected and described in relation to status on the editorial board for the most prolific author.

Results5 468 journals that published 4 986 335 papers between 2015 and 2019 were analysed. The PPMP 95th percentile was 10.6% (median 2.9%). The Gini index 95th percentile was 0.355 (median 0.183). Correlation between the two indices was 0.35 (95CI 0.33 to 0.37). Information on publication lag was available for 2 743 journals. We found that 277 journals (10.2%) had a median time lag to publication for articles by the most prolific author(s) that was shorter than 3 weeks, versus 51 (1.9%) journals with articles not authored by prolific author(s). Among the random sample of outlier journals, 98 provided information about their editorial board. Among these 98, the most prolific author was part of the editorial board in 60 cases (61%), among whom 25 (26% of the 98) were editors-in-chief.

DiscussionIn most journals publications are distributed across a large number of authors. Our results reveal a subset of journals where a few authors, often members of the editorial board, were responsible for a disproportionate number of publications. The papers by these authors were more likely to be accepted for publication within 3 weeks of their submission. To enhance trust in their practices, journals need to be transparent about their editorial and peer review practices."

MethodA descriptive cross-sectional study was performed among dental students and nonmedical college students in China. All the participants were required to anonymously answer a reliable online questionnaire, which covered 3 different fields of COVID-19. Average scores of dental students (D group), including junior (JD group) and senior dental students (SD group), and nonmedical college students (N group) were compared respectively. Chi-square test and independent sample T test were taken for statistical analysis with SPSS.12.

ResultsTotally 497 questionnaires were collected, including 224 from dental students and 273 from non-medical students. The overall average score was 57{+/-}19.2. The average scores of dental students were 64.5{+/-}18. The D group had significantly higher scores on the total score, section scores, and 20 questions respectively than with the N group. No significant differences were found on 5 questions. Compared with the N group, the SD group won on all three sections while JD group failed to win on the diagnose section.

ConclusionAlthough the dental student showed good awareness regarding the clinical aspects of COVID-19 than non-medical students, there are still some weakness in the part of treatment and prevention, which need to be strengthened for better prepare during work. Besides, the low accuracy rate of lower grade dental students is also worth noting."

Food security remains a serious challenge for many households in Ghana and the situation is even more prevalent among smallholder farmers. Using data collected from 2,603 farm households across Ghana and employing an ordered probit model the determinants of food security among farm households were assessed. The food security indicator-Food Consumption Score (FCS) which combines diet diversity, frequency of consumption and relative nutritional importance of different food groups was used for the analysis. Results indicated that farm households (76%) across Ghana were within the acceptable household food consumption groups. Nonetheless, 19% and 6% of farm households respectively were within the borderline and poor food consumption groups respectively. Further analysis revealed the determinants of food security to include experience, gender, improved variety adoption, access to credit and location. The suggestion is that government and private institutions should create an enabling environment to enhancing production capacities, economic and social resilience to improve on food security and nutrition."

W.",Luciane V Mello,2021-02-08,scientific communication and education,"Placements are often an extra-curricular activity of a science degree. This study reports on the outcomes of a final year credit-bearing 6-week placement module that was specifically designed to develop and enhance students employability skills. A key element of this module was that the student placements were not just evaluated from a science perspective, but with an emphasis on meaningful reflection and evaluation of employability skills development. Students recorded their levels of confidence in skills before, during and after the placement via an Online Reflective Log, as part of a modules summative assessment. First, results showed that taking part in the placement and conducting their own independent research helped students to make connections between their scientific knowledge, otherwise constrained within the walls of the undergraduate science lab, and the wider impact of their research on society. Another theme that emerged concerned career choices and aspirations, and the placement experience either confirmed prior choices or opened new horizons. The Online Reflective Log helped students to feel supported by their university supervisor who were at a distance, while feedback on their tasks challenged them to reflect on the scientific and personal skills as they were engaged in scientific activities during placement. Students agreed that they had further developed their employability skills during the placement. Students acknowledged it was challenging to have to acquire evidence of skills development but appreciated the usefulness of this reflection in relation to their future careers."

M.; Cameron, R.; Jorgensen, A.",Jake M Robinson,2021-02-09,scientific communication and education,"Germaphobia -- a pathological aversion to microorganisms -- could be contributing to an explosion in human immune-related disorders via mass sterilisation of surfaces and reduced exposure to biodiversity. Loss of biodiversity and our connectedness to nature, along with poor microbial literacy may be augmenting the negative consequences of germaphobia on ecosystem health. In this study, we created an online questionnaire to acquire data on attitudes towards, and knowledge of microbes. We collected data on nature connectedness and interactions with nature and explored the relationships between these variables. We found a significant association between attitudes towards microbes and both duration and frequency of visits to natural environments. A higher frequency of visits to nature per week, and a longer duration spent in nature per visit, significantly associated with positive attitudes towards microbes. We found no association between nature connectedness and attitudes towards microbes. We found a significant relationship between knowledge of  lesser known microbial groups (e.g., identifying that fungi, algae, protozoa, and archaea are microbes) and positive attitudes towards microbes. However, we also found that people who correctly identified viruses as being microbes expressed less positive views of microbes overall -- this could potentially be attributed to a  COVID-19 effect. Our results suggest that basic microbial literacy and nature engagement may be important in reducing/preventing germaphobia. The results also suggest that a virus-centric phenomenon (e.g., COVID-19) could increase broader germaphobia. As the rise of immune-related disorders and mental health conditions have been linked to germaphobia, reduced biodiversity, and non-targeted sterilisation, our findings point to a feasible strategy to potentially help ameliorate these negative consequences. A greater emphasis on microbial literacy and promoting time spent in nature could be useful in promoting resilience in human health and more positive/constructive attitudes towards the foundations of our ecosystems - the microorganisms."

R.; Lazerwitz, M.; Fotopoulou, K.",Eleanor R Palser,2021-02-16,scientific communication and education,"While certain metrics of diversity have seen great improvement in recent years in academic psychology and neuroscience, unequal representation remains for many positions of power. Here, we reviewed publicly available information in order to infer the proportion of editors by gender and their country of affiliation in the top 50 journals worldwide in each of the two fields. The sample included a total of 2,864 editors for psychology journals and 3,093 editors for neuroscience journals. There was a statistically significant difference in the proportion of male and female editors in both fields, both across editorial roles, and within various role categories, including editor-in-chief and their deputies at neuroscience journals, associate and section editors in both fields, and editorial and advisory board members in both fields. The only category in which there was not a significant imbalance of male and female scholars was the editors-in-chief of psychology journals and their deputies. Geographically, USA-based academics significantly outnumbered those from other countries as editors in both psychology and neuroscience. Results also indicated that over three quarters of psychology journals (76%) were comprised of more than 50% male editors, while only 20% had a similar proportion of female editors. In neuroscience, 88% of journals were comprised of more than 50% male editors, while only 10% of journals included a similar, proportional majority of female editors. Findings suggest that editorial positions in academic journals, possibly one of the most powerful decision-making roles in academic psychology and neuroscience, are not balanced in gender or geographical representation."

However, heading a successful research team, also requires leadership skills. Despite the clear need, leadership development has been systematically neglected in the present academic system. At the same time, growing evidence suggests that leadership styles of academic supervisors can dramatically affect the mental health of academic employees as well as drive highly skilled researchers out of academia. Here, we assessed the current state of academic leadership in the German academic system by surveying 368 participants currently employed in academia in Germany. We report that 64% of current academic leaders did not feel prepared for their current position while 86% of participants expressed their interest in leadership development programs offered by their research institutions. Our results highlight the demand for leadership development programs in German academic institutions to ensure a more efficient academic system."

L.",Sanjay  Rathee,2021-02-18,scientific communication and education,"Publishing original scientific research is inherent to the work of a researcher. However, the pressure to maintain productivity and scientific impact can lead to research group publishing excessively, negatively affecting the mental health of a researcher. Ph.D. students and early career researchers are particularly susceptible to this pressure due to the inherent vulnerability of their positions. At present, there are no resources that concisely summarise the publication culture of a research group to help the researcher make an informed decision before joining. In this article, we present the  Super Researcher app, an R Shiny application(app) with a user-friendly interface. Using text-mining methodology to extract publicly available author data from Scopus, this pilot app has four fundamental functions to provide snapshot information that will help researchers grasp the publication culture of a research group within minutes. The  Super Researcher app provides information on: 1) institution data, 2) authors publication, 3) co-author network plots and 4) publication journals.

The  Super Researcher app is built on R shiny which provides an interactive interface to users. This app utilizes the Big Data framework Apache Spark to mine relevant information from a huge author information database. The authors information is stored and manipulated using both SQL(SQLite) and NoSQL(HBase) databases. Hbase is used for local data storage and manipulation while SQLite feeds data to the R Shiny interface.

In this paper, we introduce these functionalities and illustrate how this information can help guide a researcher to select a new Principle Investigator (PI) with better compatibility in terms of publication attitude using a case study. Available: https://researchmind.co.uk/super-researcher/"

The government reacted by imposing several measures including community quarantine, class suspensions, drug therapy and vaccine development, and travel restrictions. This online survey was done amongst Filipino health professions undergraduate students to uncover the relationship between their knowledge, attitude, and practice during this pandemic.

MethodsCross-sectional data were obtained from an online survey done on students of medicine, dentistry, optometry, rehabilitative sciences, and pharmacy.

ResultsAt a response rate of 100% (n=1257), the results show that healthcare profession students in the Philippines have good knowledge (87.6%) and practices (63.6%) regarding COVID-19, yet attitude (63.6%) was just passable. This study also shows that a strong correlation exists between knowledge and practice concerning the current pandemic, r(2) = 0.08, P = 0.004.

ConclusionAdequate knowledge of COVID-19 impacts good practices of avoiding crowded places and misuse of steam inhalation amongst health profession students in the Philippines. Knowledge and practice pertaining to the current pandemic have been found to be good, but attitude remains low."

This phenomenon has sharpened longstanding questions about the reliability of information shared prior to journal peer review. Does the information shared in preprints typically withstand the scrutiny of peer review, or are conclusions likely to change in the version of record? We assessed preprints from bioRxiv and medRxiv that had been posted and subsequently published in a journal through 30th April 2020, representing the initial phase of the pandemic response. We utilised a combination of automatic and manual annotations to quantify how an article changed between the preprinted and published version. We found that the total number of figure panels and tables changed little between preprint and published articles. Moreover, the conclusions of 7.2% of non-COVID-19-related and 17.2% of COVID-19-related abstracts undergo a discrete change by the time of publication, but the majority of these changes do not qualitatively change the conclusions of the paper."

S.",Laith  Hussain-Alkhateeb,2021-02-23,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundDuring 2017, twenty health districts (locations) in Mexico implemented a dengue outbreak early warning and response system (EWARS) that uses epidemiological, meteorological and entomological variables (alarm indicators) to predict dengue outbreaks and triggers early response activities.

Eleven of these districts were analyzed as they presented reliable information. Nine districts presented outbreak alarms but without subsequent outbreaks (""non-outbreak districts"") and two presented after the alarms dengue outbreaks (""outbreak districts""). This study is concerned with i) if the alarms without outbreaks were false alarms or if the control services had established effective response activities averting an outbreak and ii) if vector control activities can mitigate or even avert dengue outbreaks.

MethodsFive components of dengue outbreak response (larval control, entomological studies with water container interventions, focal spraying, indoor residual spraying, space spraying) were quantitatively analyzed across two groups (""outbreak districts"" and ""non-outbreak districts"").

ResultsThe average coverage of vector control and responses were higher in non-outbreak districts and across all five components. In the ""outbreak districts"" the response activities started late and were of much lower intensity compared to ""non-outbreak districts"". District vector control teams demonstrated diverse compliance with local guidlines for  initial,  early and  late responses to outbreak alarms which could explain the different outcomes observed following the outbreak alarms.

Conclusionfindings from this study plausibly demonstrates important operational scenarios when succeeding or failing alarms signals generated by EWARS at national level. This study presents evidence warranting for further investigation into the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of EWARS using gold-standard designs."

COVID-19 cancellations of many summer fellowships and internships for undergraduates across the country increased students uncertainty about their educational opportunities and careers. When the pandemic necessitated elimination of on-campus programming at Mayo Clinic, a new program was developed for remote delivery. Summer Foundations in Research (SFIR) was drafted around 4 aims: 1) support the academic trajectory gap in research science created by COVID-19; 2) build sustainable scientific relationships with mentors, peers, and the community; 3) create opportunities for participants to share and address concerns with their own experiences in the pandemic; and 4) provide support for individual wellbeing. SFIR included research training, but also training in communication through generative Dialogue and resilience through Amit Soods SMART program. 170 participants were followed for outcomes in these spaces. Knowledge of and interest in careers involving biomedical research rose significantly following SFIR. Participants mean confidence levels in 12 Key areas of research rose between 0.08 to 1.32 points on a 7-point scale.

It is well acknowledged that the first diseased individuals appeared in China as early as in December 2019, and possibly even earlier in November. It has also been well established that the virus stroke Italy later in January or in February 2020, distinctly after the outbreak in China. Paper by Apolone et al. published in a local Italian medical journal in November 2020 however exposed this chronology to doubt.

By fitting early part of the epidemic curve with the exponential model and extrapolating it backwards in time, we could estimate the day-zero of the epidemic and calculated its confidence intervals in Italy and China. We also calculated how probable it is that Italy encountered the virus prior 1 January 2020.

We determined an early portion of the epidemic curve representing unhindered exponential growth which fit the exponential model with high determination >0.97 in both countries. We suggest that the day-zero in China and Italy was 8 December (95% CI: 3 Dec., 20 Dec.) and 22 January (95% CI: 16 Jan., 29 Jan.), respectively. We could with high confidence reject that Italy encountered the virus earlier than China (p <0.01).

Based on our analysis we oppose the findings published by Apolone at al. and view the proposed pre-pandemic presence of the virus in Italy as very unlikely."

Furthermore, of the data that are collected, differences in collection method and data naming conventions, like inconsistent naming of universities, hinders our ability to merge information across different datasets. Here I describe the creation of three macros meant to align the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics Survey of Graduate Students and Postdoctorates in Science and Engineering (GSS) with NIH grants databases based on consolidating university names under a single name common to both databases. Aligning these databases will allow for a deeper understanding of how various federal and university policies affect the number trainees, grants, and funding at individual institutions."

This studys objective was to devise a method for measuring the prevalence of mask-wearing and proper mask use in indoor public areas without relying on self-report. A stratified random sample of retail trade stores (public areas) in Louisville, Kentucky, USA, was selected and targeted for observation by trained surveyors during December 14-20, 2020. The stratification allowed for investigating mask use behavior by city district, retail trade group, and public area size. The average mask use prevalence among observed visitors of the 382 visited public areas was 96%, while the average prevalence of proper use was 86%. In 17% of the public areas, at least one unmasked visitor was among the observed visitors; in 48%, at least one improperly masked visitor was observed. The average mask use among staff was 92%, but unmasked staff were observed in fewer public areas, as an unmasked staff member was observed in 11% of the visited public areas. The average prevalence of proper make use among staff was 87%, similar to the average among visitors. However, the percentage of public areas where at least one improperly masked staff was observed was 33. Significant disparities in mask use and its proper use were observed among both visitors and staff by public area size, retail trade type, and geographical area. Observing unmasked and incorrectly masked visitors was more common in small (less than 1500 square feet) public areas than larger ones, also in food and grocery stores than other retail stores. Also, the majority of the observed unmasked persons were male and middle age adults."

Al-Ashwal,2021-02-25,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundSince the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, many pharmaceutical companies were racing to develop a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine. Simultaneously, rumors and misinformation about COVID-19 were and still widely spreading. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the prevalence of COVID-19 misinformation among the Yemeni population and its association with vaccine acceptance and perceptions.

MethodsA cross-sectional online survey was conducted in four major cities in Yemen. The constructed questionnaire consisted of four main sections (sociodemographic data, misinformation, perceptions (perceived susceptibility, severity and worry), and vaccination acceptance evaluation). Subject recruitment and data collection were conducted online utilizing social websites and using the snowball sampling technique. Descriptive and inferential analyses were performed using SPSS version 27.

ResultsThe total number of respondents was 484. Over 60% of them were male and had a university education, more than half had less than 100$ monthly income and were Khat chewers, while only 18% were smokers. Misinformation prevalence ranged from 8.9% to 38.9%, depending on the statement being asked. Men, university education, higher income, employment, and living in urban areas were associated with a lower misinformation level (p <0.05). Statistically significant association (p <0.05) between university education, living in urban areas, and being employed with perceived susceptibility were observed. The acceptance rate was 61.2% for free vaccines, but it decreased to 43% if they had to purchase it. Females, respondents with lower monthly income, and those who believed that pharmaceutical companies made the virus for financial gains were more likely to reject the vaccination (p <0.05).

ConclusionThe study revealed that the acceptance rate to take a vaccine was suboptimal and significantly affected by gender, misinformation, cost, and income. Furthermore, being female, Nonuniversity educated, low-income, and living in rural areas were associated with higher susceptibility to misinformation about COVID-19. These findings show a clear link between misinformation susceptibility and willingness to vaccinate. Focused awareness campaigns to decrease misinformation and emphasize the vaccinations safety and efficacy might be fundamental before initiating any mass vaccination in Yemen."

Using citation analyses, we asked: which sources informed Wikipedias COVID-19-related articles before and during the pandemics first wave (January-May 2020).

ResultsWe found that coronavirus-related articles referenced trusted media sources and high-quality academic research. Moreover, despite a surge in COVID-19 preprints, Wikipedia had a clear preference for open-access studies published in respected journals and made little use of preprints. Building a timeline of English COVID-19 articles from 2001-2020 revealed a nuanced trade-off between quality and timeliness. It further showed how preexisting articles on key topics related to the virus created a framework for integrating new knowledge. Supported by a rigid sourcing policy, this ""scientific infrastructure"" facilitated contextualization and regulated the influx of new information. Lastly, we constructed a network of DOI-Wikipedia articles, which showed the shifting landscape of pandemic-related knowledge on Wikipedia and how academic citations create a web of shared knowledge supporting topics like COVID-19 vaccine development.

ConclusionsUnderstanding how scientific research interacts with the digital knowledge-sphere during the pandemic provides insight into how Wikipedia can facilitate access to science. It also reveals how, aided by what we term its ""citizen encyclopedists"", it successfully fended off COVID-19 disinformation and how this unique model may be deployed in other contexts."

However, an understanding of neurocognitive processes of elaborated feedback during instructor-learner interactions remains elusive. Here, a two-person interactive design is used during simultaneous recording of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals from adult instructor-learner dyads. Instructors either provided elaborated feedback (i.e., correct answer and an example) or simple feedback (i.e., correct answer only) to learners during a concept learning task. Our results showed that elaborated feedback produced comparable levels of retention to simple feedback, however, transfer was significantly enhanced by elaboration. We also noted significant instructor-learner neural synchronization in frontoparietal regions during the provision of elaborated feedback, especially when examples were provided. Further, interpersonal neural synchronization in the parietal cortex successfully predicted transfer of knowledge to novel contexts. This prediction was retained for both learner-delayed and learner-preceding neural synchronization. These findings point toward transfer effects of elaborated feedback provided in a social context can be predictable through interpersonal neural synchronization, which may hold important implications for real-world learning and pedagogical efficacy.

Educational Impact and Implications StatementFeedback provides learners with crucial information regarding the gap between what has currently been achieved and what remains to be achieved, and thus plays a critical role in any learning process. In real-world settings, feedback is typically provided and received through social interaction, and high-quality ""elaborated feedback"" contains complex information that goes beyond the correct answer. This study aims to elucidate the neurocognitive processes underpinning elaborated feedback during instructor-learner interactions. We detected significant instructor-learner neural synchronization in mutual frontoparietal brain regions during elaborated feedback, particularly during the provision of specific elaborated information (i.e., concrete examples). Moreover, this synchronization (including learner-delayed and learner-preceded synchronization) in the parietal region predicted whether the learners transferred learning to novel examples of learned psychology concepts. This study advances current understanding on the neural mechanisms for elaborated feedback and the role of social interaction in feedback effects. These results may have important implications for successful real-world learning and communication, and related pedagogical applications in educational settings."

K.",William K Hallman,2021-03-02,scientific communication and education,"Using an online experiment with a nationally representative sample of 1200 adult American consumers, two ""common or usual names,"" ""Cell-Based Seafood"" and ""Cell-Cultured Seafood,"" were assessed using five criteria. Displayed on packages of frozen Atlantic Salmon, the names were evaluated on their ability to differentiate the novel products from conventionally-produced fish, to identify their potential allergenicity, and after learning its meaning, to be seen by participants as an appropriate term for describing the process for creating the product. In addition, the names were evaluated as to whether they would be interpreted as disparaging of new or existing products, and whether they elicited reactions contrary to the assertion that the products are nutritious, healthy and safe. The results confirmed earlier research showing that ""Cell-Based Seafood"" slightly outperformed ""Cell-Cultured Seafood"" as a common or usual name. Labeling products with the term ""Cell-Based Seafood"" meets important regulatory criteria by enabling consumers to distinguish such products from conventional seafood products, and by indicating the presence of allergens. From a marketing perspective, ""Cell-Based"" is also viewed as an appropriate term for describing the process for producing the products, meeting the criteria for transparency. Consumers also had more positive reactions to ""Cell-Based Seafood"" and were slightly more inclined to want to taste and purchase ""Cell-Based"" products both before and after learning the meaning of ""Cell-Based"" and ""Cell-Cultured."" Therefore, ""Cell-Based Seafood"" should be adopted as the best common or usual name to label cell-based seafood products.

Practical ApplicationWidespread adoption and consistent use of a single ""common or usual name"" for ""Cell-Based"" seafood, meat, poultry and other products by the food industry, regulators, journalists, marketers, environmental, consumer, and animal rights advocates, and other key stakeholders would help shape public perceptions and understanding of this rapidly advancing technology and its products. This study confirms that ""Cell-Based Seafood"" is the best performing term to label seafood products made from the cells of fish. It meets relevant FDA regulatory requirements and slightly outperforms ""Cell-Cultured Seafood"" with regard to positive consumer perceptions, interest in tasting and likelihood of purchasing these novel products."

C.",Jairo  Calderari  Oliveira,2021-03-04,scientific communication and education,"Kaolinite (Kt) is the most studied mineral, being widely used in the ceramic, pharmaceutical and cellulose industries, in addition to being the main soil mineral in the world. Found in different parts of the planet, it differs in genesis and may be formed as a result of local weathering of the rocks, occurring in the silt fraction; and also due to the minerals neogenesis with a predominance of clay-sized particles. The plain of upper Iguacu river has the largest kaolinitic deposit in the south of Brazil and its formation raised doubts if this kaolin was transported or formed in situ due the high organic matter in the alluvial plain. To elucidate the origin of kaolin deposits, we sampled a possible font of the mineral, in the mountains of Serra do Mar and sampled two tubes that reach 4 m depth in the upper Iguacu plain. We performed textural analysis, organic carbon, X-ray diffraction, Kt crystallography in silt and clay fractions, thermal analysis (TDA/TG) to quantify Kt and Gb in the clay fraction and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with dispersive energy spectroscopy (EDS). The TDA/TG analysis demonstrated that saprolite has 66% of the kaolinite found in the plain. The XRD analysis shows a significant presence of mica (Mc) in all samples of the silt fraction, both in Serra do Mar and in the plain. In SEM/EDS, crystals with planar growth are observed, and the presence of pseudomorphic Mc-Kt in the silt fraction of all analyzed samples, with emphasis on the tubes sample with the crystal having almost twice the size of that observed in the saprolite sample from Serra do Mar, allowing to infer that the Kt of the silt fraction of the wetland soils were formed on site by the diagenesis of mica particles. The results obtained in this work indicate that the kaolinitic material found in the wetland of the upper Iguacu plain is the result of weathering processes in the wetland itself, evidenced by the large pseudomorphs found, even greater than those observed in Serra do Mar."

In achieving this objective, this paper uses primary data collected from 1822 students and three different Likert scales and a one-way ANOVA test are used to assess knowledge, attitudes, and practice (KAP) scores and mean differences with respect to different variables. The research reveals that the majority of students have a higher level of knowledge and a positive attitude towards the COVID-19 guidelines. In contrary, only 0.22 percent students show strong compliance towards COVID-19 guidelines while majority students (60.54 percent) have rather a poor adherence which is an alarming finding. Reopening the educational institutions in Bangladesh is, therefore, not advisable yet and reinforcing the preventive measures through campaigns and online discussion to persuade people to follow the preventive guidelines is highly recommended to contain this global disease.

The UCSF AI4ALL program was established in 2019 to address this issue by promoting diversity and inclusion in AI. The program targets high school students from underrepresented backgrounds in AI and gives them a chance to learn about AI with a focus on biomedicine. In 2020, the UCSF AI4ALL three-week program was held entirely online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus students participated virtually to gain experience with AI, interact with diverse role models in AI, and learn about advancing health through AI. Specifically, they attended lectures in coding and AI, received an in-depth research experience through hands-on projects exploring COVID-19, and engaged in mentoring and personal development sessions with faculty, researchers, industry professionals, and undergraduate and graduate students, many of whom were women and from underrepresented racial and ethnic backgrounds. At the conclusion of the program, the students presented the results of their research projects at our final symposium. Comparison of pre- and post-program survey responses from students demonstrated that after the program, significantly more students were familiar with how to work with data and to evaluate and apply machine learning algorithms. There was also a nominally significant increase in the students knowing people in AI from historically underrepresented groups, feeling confident in discussing AI, and being aware of careers in AI. We found that we were able to engage young students in AI via our online training program and nurture greater inclusion in AI."

The recent COVID-19 pandemic has created challenges for both teachers and students and a demand for new methodologies of remote learning. In the life sciences, mixing online content with practical activities represents an even greater challenge. In microbiology, the implementation of an active teaching methodology, the #Adopt project, based on the social network Facebook(R), represents an excellent option for connecting remote education with classroom activities. In 2020, the version applied in high school, ""Adopt a Microorganism"", was adapted to meet the demands of emergency remote education owing to the suppression of face-to-face activities caused by the pandemic. In the present study, we assessed how the change in methodology impacted the discourse richness of students from high school integrated with technical education in the Business Administration program of the Federal Institute of Sao Paulo, Sorocaba Campus. Three questionnaires related to the groups of microorganisms (Archaea, Bacteria, Virus, Fungi, and Protozoan) were applied. The students responses in the 2019 and 2020 classes were compared concerning content richness and multiplicity of concepts through the application of the Shannon diversity index, an approach that is generally used to assess biodiversity in different environments. The observed results suggest that remote learning provided students with a conceptual basis and richness of content equivalent to that achieved by students subjected to the hybrid teaching model. In conclusion, this study suggests that the #Adopt project methodology increases students discourse richness in microbiology even without face-to-face traditional classes."

J.",Ian  John  Lean,2021-03-11,scientific communication and education,"There has been considerable interest in the use of red seaweed, and in particular Asparagopsis taxiformis, to increase production of cattle and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We hypothesized that feeding seaweed or seaweed derived products would increase beef or dairy cattle performance as indicated by average daily gain (ADG), feed efficiency measures, milk production, and milk constituents, and reduce methane emissions. We used meta-analytical methods to evaluate these hypotheses. A comprehensive search of Google Scholar, Pubmed and ISI Web of Science produced 14 experiments from which 23 comparisons of treatment effects could be evaluated. Red seaweed (A. taxiformis) and brown seaweed (Ascophyllum nodosum) were the dominant seaweeds used. There were no effects of treatment on ADG or dry matter intake (DMI). There was an increase in efficiency for feed to gain by 0.41 {+/-} 0.22 kg per kg [standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.70 {+/-} 0.35; P = 0.001], but not for gain to feed (P = 0.215), although the direction of the change was for improved efficiency. The type of seaweed used was not a significant covariable for ADG and DMI. Milk production was increased with treatment on weighted mean difference (WMD; 1.35 {+/-} 0.44 kg/d; P <0.001); however, the SMD of 0.45 was not significant (P = 0.111). Extremely limited data suggest the possibility of increased percentages of milk fat (P = 0.040) and milk protein (P = 0.001) on DerSimonian and Laird (D&L) WMD evaluation. The limited data available indicate dietary supplementation with seaweed produced a significant and substantial reduction in methane yield by 5.28 {+/-} 3.5 g/kg DMI (P = 0.003) on D&L WMD evaluation and a D&L SMD of -1.70 (P = 0.001); however, there was marked heterogeneity in the results (I2 > 80%). In one comparison, methane yield was reduced by 97%. We conclude that while there was evidence of potential for benefit from seaweed use to improve production and reduce methane yield more in vivo experiments are required to strengthen the evidence of effect and identify sources of heterogeneity in methane response, while practical applications and potential risks are evaluated for seaweed use."

However, the analysis of paper-and-pencil questionnaires is time consuming, source of errors and expensive, limiting its use in large cohort studies. Computer-based questionnaires might be a valuable alternative but they may introduce bias, especially for sensitive questions, and they require programming skills. The aim of this study is to develop a reliable and adaptable open-source technique (i.e. LightQuest) to automatically analyse various types of scanned paper-and-pencil questionnaires with closed questions, including those with inverted scale.

MethodsTo evaluate the usefulness of LightQuest, the time needed for 7 experimenters for manually code 10 sets of 4 frequently used questionnaires and the number of errors (i.e. reliability) were compared with the time and errors their made using LightQuest.

ResultsLightQuest was twice as fast as the manual analysis, even though the time to create the reference model was taken into account (933s vs. 1935s, t(2)=8.81, p<0.001). Without model creation, the reduced analysis time was more pronounced, with an average of 2.77s.question-1 for the manual technique versus 0.55s.question-1 for LightQuest (t(2)=22.5, p<0.001). Moreover, during correction of the 5180 questions performed by the 7 experimenters, LightQuest made a total of 2 errors versus 46 with the manual technique (q(2)=4.53, p<0.05).

ConclusionLightQuest demonstrated clear superiority both in terms of time and reliability. The script of this first open-source technique, which does not require programming skills, is downloadable in supplemental data and may become an asset for all studies using questionnaires."

There were two purposes of the present study. Above all, it was to compare WOPDs (i.e. jerk and back jerk) with jump squat in enhancing sport performance such as vertical jump in the perspective of biomechanics. Furthermore, it was to gain a better understanding of the biomechanical difference between jerk and back jerk. The study compared the kinetics, kinematics, and muscle activation of the jerk, back jerk, vertical jump and jump squat. Ground reaction forces, joint angle data and electromyography were collected from 20 track and field athletes while they performed the four movements. The joint coordination pattern and EMG characters of the jump squat were more similar to those of the vertical jump. WOPDs, especially jerk, exhibited less similarity with vertical jump in joint coordination, as well as the subsequent peak activation. The electromyography data demonstrated significant differences in rectus femoris and gluteus maximus in the relative timing of peak activations and the maximum activation. Jump squat was greater in peak force (2211N) than jerk (P < .005), greater peak power (4749W) than jerk and back jerk (P < .001) and no significant difference with WOPDs in rate of force development. Back jerk produced a greater peak force (2223 N), peak power (3767W) and eccentric RFD (15965 N{middle dot}s-1) than jerk (2061N)(P < .001) (3364W)(P < .05) (12280 N{middle dot}s-1)(P < .01)and the opposite in concentric RFD that jerk (7702 N{middle dot}s-1) was greater than back jerk (5972 N{middle dot}s-1)(P < .05). We can conclude that for runner and jumpers, jump squat was better for improving vertical jump than WOPDs and back jerk is better than jerk in power training."

P.; Grabitz, P.; Rife, S.",Joshua M Nicholson,2021-03-16,scientific communication and education,"Citation indices are tools used by the academic community for research and research evaluation which aggregate scientific literature output and measure scientific impact by collating citation counts. Citation indices help measure the interconnections between scientific papers but fall short because they only display paper titles, authors, and the date of publications, and fail to communicate contextual information about why a citation was made. The usage of citations in research evaluation without due consideration to context can be problematic, if only because a citation that disputes a paper is treated the same as a citation that supports it. To solve this problem, we have used machine learning and other techniques to develop a ""smart citation index"" called scite, which categorizes citations based on context. Scite shows how a citation was used by displaying the surrounding textual context from the citing paper, and a classification from our deep learning model that indicates whether the statement provides supporting or disputing evidence for a referenced work, or simply mentions it. Scite has been developed by analyzing over 23 million full-text scientific articles and currently has a database of more than 800 million classified citation statements. Here we describe how scite works and how it can be used to further research and research evaluation."

N.; Kelly, R. F.; Handel, I.; Mazeri, S.; Bronsvoort, B. M.",Adrian  Muwonge,2021-03-23,scientific communication and education,"The use of network analysis to support livestock disease control in low middle-income countries (LMICs) has historically been hampered by the cost of generating empirical data in the absence of animal movement recording schemes. To fill this gap, methods which exploit freely available demographic and archived molecular data can be used to generate livestock networks based on gravity and phylogeographic modelling techniques, respectively. However, questions remain on the performance of these methods in capturing the topology of empirical networks. Here, we compare output from these network methodologies to a network constructed from either empirical data or randomly generated data. To facilitate this comparison, the spread of infectious diseases was simulated, it is this evaluation that demonstrates their potential utility to inform robust livestock disease control strategies.

The molecular network was the closest approximation to the empirical network, both in relation to topological and epidemic characteristics, whereas size of epidemics in the gravity network tended to be larger, better agreement across all three networks was observed when; a) total nodes infected, b) percentage infection take off were compared. These methods consistently identified the same important animal movement and trade hotspots as the empirical networks. We therefore consider this proof-of-concept that demographic data such as censuses and archived molecular data could be repurposed to inform livestock disease management in LMICs.

Author summaryLive animal movements in Africa represent a significant risk of transmission and spread of infectious diseases in livestock populations, and therefore, have direct implications on the food security of the continent. Here we explore the potential utility of available data to support control strategies, by comparing movement networks inferred from such data i.e. census and pathogen molecular data using gravity modelling and phylogeography respectively. Their utility is evaluated by comparing their topology and disease spread characteristics to empirical live animal movement. Based on our results, we posit that archived data can be repurposed to support infectious disease control on the African continent."

However, many sources of data remain siloed, unstructured, and/or unavailable for complementary and secondary research. Sysrev was developed to address these issues. First, Sysrev was built to aid in systematic evidence reviews (SER), where digital documents are evaluated according to a well defined process, and where Sysrev provides an easy to access, publicly available and free platform for collaborating in SER projects. Secondly, Sysrev addresses the issue of unstructured, siloed, and inaccessible data in the context of generalized data extraction, where human and machine learning algorithms are combined to extract insights and evidence for better decision making across disciplines. Sysrev uses FAIR - Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of digital assets - as primary principles in design. Sysrev was developed primarily because of an observed need to reduce redundancy, reduce inefficient use of human time and increase the impact of evidence based decision making. This publication is an introduction to Sysrev as a novel technology, with an overview of the features, motivations and use cases of the tool.

MethodsSysrev.com is a FAIR motivated web platform for data curation and SER. Sysrev allows users to create data curation projects called ""sysrevs"" wherein users upload documents, define review tasks, recruit reviewers, perform review tasks, and automate review tasks.

E.",K  Supriya,2021-03-29,scientific communication and education,"Institutions across the world transitioned abruptly to remote learning in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This rapid transition to remote learning has generally been predicted to negatively affect students, particularly those marginalized due to their race, socioeconomic class, or gender identity. In this study, we examined the impact of this transition in the Spring 2020 semester on the grades of students enrolled in the in-person biology program at a large university in Southwestern United States as compared to the grades earned by students in the fully online biology program at the same institution. We also surveyed in-person instructors to understand changes in assessment practices as a result of the transition to remote learning during the pandemic. Finally, we surveyed students in the in-person program to learn about their perceptions of the impacts of this transition. We found that both online and in-person students received a similar small increase in grades in Spring 2020 compared to Spring 2018 and 2019. We also found no evidence of disproportionately negative impacts on grades received by students marginalized due to their race, socioeconomic class, or gender in either modality. Focusing on in-person courses, we documented that instructors made changes to their courses when they transitioned to remote learning, which may have offset some of the potential negative impacts on course grades. However, despite receiving higher grades, in-person students reported negative impacts on their learning, interactions with peers and instructors, feeling part of the campus community, and career preparation. Women reported a more negative impact on their learning and career preparation compared to men. This work provides insights into students perceptions of how they were disadvantaged as a result of the transition to remote instruction and illuminates potential actions that instructors can take to create more inclusive education moving forward."

If studies face delays or barriers to being published, the useful information they contain may not reach decision-makers in a timely manner. This represents a potential problem for mission-oriented disciplines where access to the latest data is paramount to ensure effective actions are deployed. We sought to analyse the severity of publication delay in conservation science -- a field that requires urgent action to prevent the loss of biodiversity. We used the Conservation Evidence database to assess the length of publication delay (time from finishing data collection to publication) in the literature that tests the effectiveness of conservation interventions. From 7,415 peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed studies of conservation interventions published over eleven decades, we find that the mean publication delay (time from completing data collection to publication) was 3.6 years and varied by conservation subject -- a smaller delay was observed for studies focussed on the management of captive animals. Publication delay was significantly smaller for studies in the non-journal literature (typically non-peer-reviewed) compared to studies published in scientific journals. Although we found publication delay has marginally increased over time (1912-2020), this change was weak post-1980s. Publication delay also varied inconsistently between studies on species with different IUCN Red List statuses and there was little evidence that studies on more threatened species were subject to a smaller delay. We discuss the possible drivers of publication delay and present suggestions for scientists, funders, publishers, and practitioners to reduce the time taken to publish studies. Although our recommendations are aimed at conservation science, they are highly relevant to other mission-driven disciplines where the rapid dissemination of scientific findings is important."

The objective of this study is to determine if these formulations satisfy requirements for essential nutrients.

MethodsWe have selected two established commercial diets, one low fat, high carbohydrate (diet 1) and the other, high fat, low carbohydrate (diet 2) and determined ""representative meals"" through use of recipes suggested in the manufacturers manuals. Nutrition Data System for Research (NDSR) software has been used to perform the most extensive nutrient analysis to date of these diets. Tables report macronutrients (energy), vitamins, minerals, essential amino acids, essential lipids and nutrient-related components for a total of 62entries.

ResultsDiet 1 satisfied requirements for 50 of these (81%) with only vitamin B12, vitamin D, and essential fatty acids not reaching recommended levels, while fiber and glycemic load exceeded suggested values. Diet 2 satisfied requirements for 46 of the components (71%) but had excess percentage of fat, especially saturated fat, sodium and cholesterol as well as decreased percentage of carbohydrate resulting in suboptimal intake of B-complex vitamins (B1, niacin and total folate) as well as fiber.

ConclusionsNeither diet satisfied adequacy for all reported nutrients. However, based on nutrient content alone diet 1, if supplemented or modified, could be sustained over the long term whereas diet 2 should not be encouraged for long term adaptation"

To situate teachers with an example of how robots can be used in neuroscience classrooms, we describe an educational tool called the SpikerBot. Our preliminary results indicate that there is an opportunity for neuroscience-oriented robots in secondary education, provided sufficient on-boarding and training videos."

Teaching histopathology is always challenging more when numerous histopathology slides are involved. There is lack of interest among the students and also face challenges to correlate with the clinical presentation. For effective learning, need for a method which is interactive and helps create clinico pathological correlation was felt. This study was designed to assess the impact and feasibility of case-based learning in routine teaching among dental students.

MethodsA cross sectional study was conducted among 58 undergraduate dental students, wherein a case-based learning method was introduced in the practical classes. Thirty students were randomly selected as case based learning and remaining as conventional group. Multiple paper-based cases on oral cancer was designed and used for the case based learning group of students. A self-designed pre and posttest interventional tools along with post intervention assessment using modified essay question was designed and applied.

ResultsSignificant difference in the scores between pre and post intervention questionnaire was observed among the case-based learning group (p<0.0001), however non-significant among the conventional. Similarly, significant difference in the scores of modified essay question was observed between the study groups. Majority of the students among the case-based learning group agreed that it benefitted their personal, professional and communicative skills. The students expressed their enthusiasm in learning with this method and suggested to apply it more often.

DiscussionCase-based learning is an effective method and incorporation of it on a regular basis could help favor an effective learning environment."

Increased exposure to career opportunities and development of training in professional skills is widely recommended, but details of implementation are not widely available. In alignment with these recommendations, we have incorporated professional skills training into the biomedical science graduate curriculum at West Virginia University. An important component of the training is developing conflict resolution and negotiation skills. This training will provide useful skills for academic careers, non-academic careers and life situations outside of the workplace. Conflict resolution/negotiation skills are also relevant in managing issues in diversity, equity and inclusivity. We report our experience in developing this component of the training program, provide an overview of the approach to delivery and practice of skills, and provide an analysis of the reception and effectiveness of the training."

D. T.; Khadhraoui, L.; Rheault, N.; Moher, D.; Legare, F.",France  Légaré,2021-04-08,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundDespite growing recognition of the importance of sex and gender considerations in health research, they are rarely integrated into research design and reporting. We sought to assess the integration of sex, as a biological attribute and gender as a socially constructed identity in published reporting guidelines.

Methods and FindingsWe conducted a systematic review of published reporting guidelines listed on the EQUATOR website (www.equator-nework.org) from inception until December 2018. We selected all reporting guidelines (original and extensions) listed on the EQUATOR library. We used EndNote Citation Software to build a database of the statement of each guideline identified as  full bibliographic reference and retrieved the full texts. Reviewers independently extracted the data from the checklist/abstract/main text of guidelines. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and narrative synthesis. A total of 407 reporting guidelines were included; they were published between 1995 and 2018. Of the 407 guidelines, 159 (39%) mentioned ""sex"" and/or ""gender"" in the checklist/abstract/main text. Of these, 90 (22.1%) mentioned only ""sex"", and 91 (22.4%) mentioned only ""gender"". In the checklist of the reporting guidelines (n = 363), ""sex"" and ""gender"" were mentioned in 50 (13.8%) and 39 (10.7%), respectively. Only one reporting guideline met the three criteria of correct use of sex and gender concepts. Trends in the use of sex and gender in the checklists showed that the use of ""sex"" only started in 2003, while ""gender"" has been used since 1996.

ConclusionsWe assessed the integration of sex and gender considerations in reporting guidelines based on the use of sex- and gender-related words. Our findings showed a low use and integration of sex and gender concepts in reporting guidelines. Authors of reporting guidelines should reduce this gap for a better use of research knowledge.

A.",Stephanie Y Jo,2021-04-12,scientific communication and education,"ObjectivesThe healthcare profession has been long considered an excellent career choice. Pre-medical experience is documented to be important in shaping future medical landscape. In the wake of the pandemic, there has been intense media spotlight on the healthcare profession and change in academic environment, necessitating analyses of student experience. This project aims to assess change in undergraduate student interest in healthcare career using cross-sectional survey study.

MethodsThe project was approved by our Institutional Review Board. Voluntary survey collected data on demographics, socioeconomics, media exposure, academic environment, and change in interest in a healthcare profession. Survey was distributed through the university undergraduate pre-health listserv. Total of 297 responses were obtained. Descriptive statistics including Fishers exact test were applied in the analysis.

ResultsMajority of the respondents were Asians (54.9%), second generation immigrants (52.2%), and female (73.4%). Large proportion of the respondents were negatively affected by the pandemic, with losing a job or internship personally (42.1%) or a family member or a friend (62.6%). Students had mixed response to online learning environment, with 27.3% of students noting no change, 40.4% students noting increased difficulty, and 32.3% students noting decreased difficulty of classes. During the pandemic, 47.5% of students noted increased interest in pursuing healthcare career. The change in interest in healthcare career was not associated with xdemographics, economic hardship, or online learning environment.

DiscussionDespite the challenges of COVID-19 pandemic, students showed strong interest in pursuing healthcare careers."

D.",Michelle D Jones-London,2021-04-12,scientific communication and education,"Enhancing the diversity of the scientific workforce is critical to achieving the mission of NIH: ""To seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce the burdens of illness and disability."" However, specific groups have historically been, and continue to be, underrepresented in the biomedical research workforce, especially academia. Career choice is a multi-factorial process that evolves over time; among all trainees, expressed interest in faculty research careers decreases over time in graduate school, but that trend is amplified in women and members of historically underrepresented racial and ethnic groups (Fuhrmann, Halme, OSullivan, & Lindstaedt, 2011; Gibbs, McGready, Bennett, & Griffin, 2014; C. Golde & Dore, 2004; Roach & Sauermann, 2017; Sauermann & Roach, 2012). Neuroscience as a discipline has characteristics that may exacerbate the overall trends seen in the life sciences, such as a greater growth in the number of awarded neuroscience PhDs than in other life sciences fields (US National Science Foundation, 2016b). This work was designed to investigate how career interest changes over time among recent neuroscience PhD graduates, and whether differences in career interests are associated with social identity (i.e. gender and race/ethnicity), experiences in graduate school and postdoctoral training (e.g. relationship with advisor; feelings of belonging), and personal characteristics (e.g. confidence in ones potential to be an independent researcher). We report results from a survey of 1,479 PhD neuroscientists (including 16% underrepresented (UR) and 54% female scientists). We saw repeated evidence that individual preferences about careers in general, and academic careers specifically, predict current career interest. These statistically significant preferences mostly had medium to low effect size that varied by career type. These findings were mediated by social identity and experiences in graduate school and postdoctoral training. Our findings highlight the important influence of the advisor in shaping a trainees career path, and the ways in which academic culture is perceived as unwelcoming or incongruent with the values or priorities of certain groups. For women, issues of work/life balance and structural issues of academia, and for UR women in particular, lower confidence in their ability to be an independent researcher, affected their interest in academia. Both women and UR men in our study report a lower importance of autonomy in their careers. UR respondents report feeling less like they were a part of the social and intellectual community. However, they have formed beneficial relationships with faculty outside their PhD institutions that, particularly for UR women, are associated with increased interest in academia. Our findings suggest several areas for positive growth, ways to change how we think about the impact of mentorship, and policy and programmatic interventions that extend beyond trying to change or ""fix"" the individual and instead recognize the systemic structures that influence career choices."

Nevertheless, such terms are highly subjective and present challenges to ascertain precisely what such research looks like. Accordingly, this article responds to the question: how do faculty from universities in the United States and Canada define the terms quality, prestige, and impact? We address this question by surveying 338 faculty members from 55 different institutions. This studys findings highlight that, despite their highly varied definitions, faculty often describe these terms in overlapping ways. Additionally, results shown that marked variance in definitions across faculty does not correspond to demographic characteristics. This studys results highlight the need to more clearly implement evaluation regimes that do not rely on ill-defined concepts.

Designing museum exhibits to meet increasing public interests in the life sciences is particularly important, yet remains challenging. In this report we describe Give Heart Cells a Beat, a permanent interactive science exhibit that allows museum visitors to synchronize the beating of live stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes to their own heart rate in real-time. Evaluation with museum visitors reveals that the exhibit engaged the public with the specimen and prompted curiosity in heart biology and, to a lesser degree, stem cells and electrophysiology. Give Heart Cells a Beat is the product of a close collaboration between a museum and a research laboratory, and, to our knowledge, the first example of the use of live human heart cells in an interactive exhibit. We hope this exhibit will serve as an example for the implementation of stem cell technology in the field of informal science education and encourage others to pursue close working relationships between academia and public science venues such as museums."

M.",Shivayogappa S Teli,2021-04-20,scientific communication and education,"IntroductionThe quality of both teaching and learning techniques in health sciences determines the competency of the doctors produced and the patient care. Realizing the necessity of active learning at the undergraduate level, curricular reforms were crucial to ensure that students play an active role in the learning process and imbibe all the prerequisite qualities of a competent health professional. The objective of this study was to implement and evaluate case-based learning in the physiology curriculum.

MethodsThe study included 150 first-year MBBS students. We followed a mixed research design in this study. A short lecture on anemia was followed by two sessions of CBL with a gap of one week. A structured questionnaire on a 5-point Likert scale was used to collect students perceptions. The internal consistency of the questionnaire was Cronbach -statistic = 0.8. Faculties feedback was collected through Focus Group Discussion (FGD).

ResultsOut of 145 participants, 117 responded to feedback. Students perceived that the CBL method was effective in understanding anemia topic (71%); promoted meaningful learning (83%); encouraged teamwork (69%); improved communication skills (65%); helps in future application of knowledge (81%); motivated self-directed learning (66%); helped to understand physiology concepts better (72%); leads to the development of problem-solving abilities (70%); and better student-teacher relationship (72%). Faculties suggested developing an assessment plan for future CBL sessions.

ConclusionIn our experience, CBL is an effective, active teaching-learning tool that improves students understanding of basic concepts, clinical knowledge, problem-solving abilities, teamwork, communication skills, student-teacher relationship, and self-directed learning."

As a graduate career educator, accessing the vast silos and resources at a university and with industrial partners can be daunting, yet collaborative endeavors and network development both on and off campus are crucial to the success of any career and professional development office. To better inform and direct the efforts of graduate career offices, forty-five stakeholders external and internal to academic institutions were identified and interviewed to gather and categorize perspectives on topics critical to career and professional development offices. Using a stakeholder network visualization tool developed by the authors, stakeholder engagement can be rapidly assessed to ascertain areas where offices have strong connections and other areas where additional efforts could be directed to enhance engagement. General themes from interviews with internal and external stakeholders are discussed to provide graduate career educators with various stakeholder subgroup perspectives to help prepare for successful interactions. Benefits include increased engagement and opportunities to collaborate, as well as the opportunity to build or expand graduate career development offices."

Since the current nosology-based standard for human diseases could not offer a one-size-fits-all corrective mechanism, many idiomatic but flawed names frequently appear in scientific literature and news outlets at the cost of sociocultural impacts.

ObjectiveWe attempt to examine the ethical oversights of current naming practices and propose heuristic rationales and approaches to determine a pithy name instead of an inopportune nosology.

MethodsFirst, we examined the compiled global online news volumes and emotional tones on some inopportune nosology like German measles, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome, Spanish flu, Hong Kong flu, and Huntingtons disease in the wake of COVID-19. Second, we prototypically scrutinize the lexical dynamics and pathological differentials of German measles and common synonyms by leveraging the capacity of the Google Books Ngram Corpus. Third, we demonstrated the empirical approaches to curate an exclusive substitute for an anachronistic nosology German measles based on deep learning models and post-hoc explanations.

ResultsThe infodemiological study shows that the public informed the offensive names with extremely negative tones in textual and visual narratives. The findings of the historiographical study indicate that many synonyms of German measles did not survive, while German measles became an anachronistic usage, and rubella has taken the dominant place since 1994. The PubMedBERT model could identify rubella as a potential substitution for German measles with the highest semantic similarity. The results of the semantic drift experiments further indicate that rubella tends to survive during the ebb and flow of semantic drift.

ConclusionsOur findings indicate that the nosological evolution of anachronistic names could result in sociocultural impacts without a corrective mechanism. To mitigate such impacts, we introduce some ethical principles for formulating an improved naming scheme. Based on deep learning models and post-hoc explanations, our illustrated experiments could provide hallmark references to the remedial mechanism of naming practices and pertinent credit allocations."

To ensure that microbiome data is indeed FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable), it is necessary to consider tools and approaches that make it easier to provide high-quality metadata that is fit for purpose moving forward. Such tools and approaches could be informed by current efforts to harmonize and improve the quality of extant microbiome metadata."

However, in terms of productivity, it has been consistently failing to transform the research knowledge into industrial output. This study compares India with the leading countries to understand its lacuna in terms of R&D policy and outputs. Although scientific publications are regarded as the output of basic research, patent applications serve as a better indicator of the applied research. This paper assesses the important determinants for patent filings of a nation. It also focuses on the role of academia and industry collaboration in R&D and the productivity of a nation. We found that the higher the GERD (total Gross Domestic Expenditure of R&D) and the R&D personnel in a nation, the higher the patent filings of the nation. Moreover, we show that academia-industrial collaboration plays a key role in transforming basic research into real-world applications, as we illustrate the governments role in making necessary policies to make the collaboration successful. This paper highlights the significance of investing in R&D to improve the productivity of a nation, as also the need to design policies to strengthen the applied research environment by fostering solution-centric collaborations between academia and industry."

A.; Stofer, K.; Monroe, M.; Klarenberg, G.; Nickerson, M. A.",Kirsten A Hecht,2021-05-17,scientific communication and education,"Public Engagement with Science (PES) is a popular topic in the science community due to general concerns about public support for science, attitudes toward science, and changes in scientific funding requirements. PES may be especially relevant in conservation disciplines as the public plays an important role in conservation practice. Herpetofauna specifically stand to benefit, as PES activities can help improve attitudes and conservation behavior of participants toward uncharismatic species. We assessed the current scope of herpetologists PES activities and investigated factors associated with their participation in PES. We used a closed-ended question survey distributed via the listservs of four American herpetological organizations. Herpetologists intentions to engage at least 10 hours in the next 12 months significantly differed between herpetologists with high and low conservation research focuses, but hours of engagement in the past 12 months was not significantly different among these groups. Despite most responding herpetologists having limited formal training, time, resources, and institutional support, many participated in a variety of PES activities, often utilizing partnerships and their own resources. Sampled herpetologists rarely evaluated their PES activities or considered publishing about their engagement activities. Some respondents expressed unease with the idea of message framing. Respondents were interested in evaluation training and providing accessible opportunities, and grant funds were the most likely interventions to increase herpetologists participation in PES. These results provide reference data and insight into the public engagement practices and needs of practicing herpetologists and conservation scientists.

Through focus groups and surveys, we identified programmatic strengths and shortcomings as well as recommendations for improvements from the perspectives of participating students. Strengths included the quality of mentorship, opportunities for learning and professional development, and development of a sense of community. Weaknesses included limited cohort building, challenges with insufficient structure, and issues with technology. Although all programs had one or more activities related to diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice, these topics were largely absent from student reports even though programs coincided with a peak in national consciousness about racial inequities and structural racism. Our results provide evidence for designing remote REUs that are experienced favorably by students. Our results also indicate that remote REUs are sufficiently positive to further investigate their affordances and constraints, including the potential to scale up offerings, with minimal concern about disenfranchising students."

Between 2000-2020 we found 130 publications that can be broadly categorized into four groups: 1) checklists and biodiversity; 2) new species and taxonomy; 3) ecology and natural history; and 4) evolution and phylogenetics. An average of 6.5 papers was published per year and although the number of papers fluctuated, there was a significant upward trend in the number of papers published. Almost half (49%) of all papers published comprised checklists and biodiversity-related papers. This was followed by new species and taxonomy (25%, 33 papers), evolution and phylogenetics (14%, 18 papers), and ecology and natural history (12%, 16 papers). Amphibian research was conducted most frequently in the states of Kedah, Pahang, and Perak, and most infrequently in the states of Malacca, Negeri Sembilan, Selangor/Kuala Lumpur, Perlis, and Kelantan.

However, systematic research on the use of data visualization in stewardship is lacking. This study aimed at filling this gap by creating a visual dictionary of stewardship through an assessment of data visualization in stewardship research.

MethodsA random sample of 150 data visualizations from published research articles on stewardship were assessed. The visualization vocabulary (content) and design space (design elements) were combined to create a visual dictionary. Additionally, visualization errors, chart junk, and quality were assessed to identify problems in current visualizations and to provide improvement recommendations.

ResultsDespite a heterogeneous use of data visualization, distinct combinations of graphical elements to reflect stewardship data were identified. In general, bar (n=54; 36.0%) and line charts (n=42; 28.1%) were preferred visualization types. Visualization problems comprised colour scheme mismatches, double y-axis, hidden data points through overlaps, and chart junk. Recommendations were derived that can help to clarify visual communication, improve colour use for grouping/stratifying, improve the display of magnitude, and match visualizations to scientific standards.

ConclusionsResults of this study can be used to guide data visualization creators in designing visualizations that fit the data and visual habits of the stewardship target audience. Additionally, the results can provide the basis to further expand the visual dictionary of stewardship towards more effective visualizations that improve data insights, knowledge, and clinical decision-making."

E.; Stenrod, M.; Petersen, K.; Moe, J.",Sophie  Mentzel,2021-05-21,scientific communication and education,"Conventional environmental risk assessment of chemicals is based on a calculated risk quotient, representing the ratio of exposure to effects of the chemical, in combination with assessment factors to account for uncertainty. Probabilistic risk assessment approaches can offer more transparency, by using probability distributions for exposure and/or effects to account for variability and uncertainty. In this study, a probabilistic approach using Bayesian network (BN) modelling is explored as an alternative to traditional risk calculation. BNs can serve as meta-models that link information from several sources and offer a transparent way of incorporating the required characterization of uncertainty for environmental risk assessment. To this end, a BN has been developed and parameterised for the pesticides azoxystrobin, metribuzin, and imidacloprid. We illustrate the development from deterministic (traditional) risk calculation, via intermediate versions, to fully probabilistic risk characterisation using azoxystrobin as an example. We also demonstrate seasonal risk calculation for the three pesticides."

L",Tatsuya  Amano,2021-05-26,scientific communication and education,"The widely held assumption that any important scientific information would be available in English underlies the underuse of non-English-language science across disciplines. However, non-English-language science is expected to bring unique and valuable scientific information, especially in disciplines where the evidence is patchy, and for emergent issues where synthesising available evidence is an urgent challenge. Yet such contribution of non-English-language science to scientific communities and the application of science is rarely quantified. Here we show that non-English-language studies provide crucial evidence for informing global biodiversity conservation. By screening 419,680 peer-reviewed papers in 16 languages, we identified 1,234 non-English-language studies providing evidence on the effectiveness of biodiversity conservation interventions, compared to 4,412 English-language studies identified with the same criteria. Relevant non-English-language studies are being published at an increasing rate, and can expand the geographical (by 12-25%) and taxonomic (by 5-32%) coverage of English-language evidence, especially in biodiverse regions, albeit often based on less robust study designs. Our results show that synthesising non-English-language studies is key to overcoming the widespread lack of local, context-dependent evidence and facilitating evidence-based conservation globally. We urge wider disciplines to rigorously reassess the untapped potential of non-English-language science in informing decisions to address other global challenges."

Efficient management of infectious diseases requires a top-down approach which must be complemented with a bottom-up response to be effective. Here we investigate a novel approach to surveillance for transboundary animal diseases using African Swine fever as a model. We were able to collect data at a population level on information-seeking behavior and at a local level through a targeted questionnaire-based survey to relevant stakeholders such as farmers and veterinary authorities. Our study shows how information-seeking behavior and resulting public attention during an epidemic, can be addressed through novel data streams from digital platforms such as Wikipedia. We also bring evidence on how field surveys aimed at local workers (e.g. farmers) and public authorities remain a crucial tool to assess more in-depth preparedness and awareness among front-line actors. We conclude that they should be used in combination to maximize the outcome of surveillance and prevention activities for selected transboundary animal diseases."

L.",Donna L Maney,2021-05-31,scientific communication and education,"As part of an initiative to improve rigor and reproducibility in biomedical research, the U. S. National Institutes of Health now requires the consideration of sex as a biological variable in preclinical studies. This new policy has been interpreted by some as a call to compare males and females with each other. Researchers testing for sex differences may not be trained to do so, however, increasing risk for misinterpretation of results. Using a list of recently published articles curated by Woitowich et al. (eLife, 2020; 9:e56344), we examined reports of sex differences and non-differences across nine biological disciplines. Sex differences were claimed in the majority of the 147 articles we analyzed; however, statistical evidence supporting those differences was often missing. For example, when a sex-specific effect of a manipulation was claimed, authors usually had not tested statistically whether females and males responded differently. Thus, sex-specific effects may be over-reported. In contrast, we also encountered practices that could mask sex differences, such as pooling the sexes without first testing for a difference. Our findings support the need for continuing efforts to train researchers how to test for and report sex differences in order to promote rigor and reproducibility in biomedical research."

D.; Williams, J.",Jason  Williams,2021-06-01,scientific communication and education,"The COVID-19 pandemic is a national tragedy, one that has focused our attention on both the need to improve science education and the need to confront systemic racism in our country. We know that active learning strategies, in particular research experiences, can engage and empower STEM undergraduates, effectively closing the achievement gap for historically excluded persons. The apprenticeship model for STEM training - supervised research under a dedicated mentor - is highly effective, but out of reach for most students. Recent efforts have demonstrated that Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) can be an effective approach for making STEM research accessible for all. Our meta-analysis of CUREs finds that published examples now cover the breadth of the typical undergraduate biology curriculum. A thoughtfully designed CURE can go beyond foundational knowledge and analytical thinking to include career-related skills, e.g., teamwork and communication. Similarly, it can be designed with equity as a foundational principle, taking into account the unique contributions of all students and their varying needs. We provide here an example framework (The ""Do Science Framework"") for making STEM training more effective and inclusive using CUREs. While CUREs do not inherently address equity, there can be no equity in STEM education without equal access to research participation, and progress toward this goal can be achieved using CUREs. However, implementing new CUREs is not a trivial undertaking, particularly at schools with high teaching loads and little or no research infrastructure, including many community colleges. We therefore propose a National Center for Science Engagement to support this transition, building on experiences of current nationally established CUREs as well as the work of many individual faculty. In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, academia has a renewed responsibility to dismantle structural inequities in education; engaging all STEM students in research can be a key step."

Ecological-belonging interventions use a classroom-based activity to instill norms that adversity is normal, temporary and surmountable. Building on prior studies, we sought to identify the conditions under which such interventions are effective. In a chemistry course (Study 1), students from underrepresented ethnic backgrounds underperformed relative to their peers in the absence of the intervention. This performance gap was eliminated by the intervention. In an introductory biology course (Study 2), there were no large performance gaps in the absence of the intervention, and the intervention had no effect. Study 2 also explored the role of the instructor that delivers the intervention. The intervention boosted scores in classrooms of instructors with a fixed (versus growth-oriented) intelligence mindset. Our results suggest that ecological-belonging interventions are more effective in more threatening classroom contexts."

However, it suffers one of the highest rates of forest loss worldwide, mainly due to strong anthropogenic pressures. As Comorian populations depend on forest resources for subsistence, establishing relevant conservation strategies for their sustainable management requires the consideration of multiple stakeholders perspectives toward biodiversity and habitat conservation. To better understand the relationships between humans and nature; how comorian people use natural resource and the relevance of a protected area for long-term biodiversity conservation, we used Q-methodology to assess local people s perceptions regarding biodiversity and conservation actions. Three discourses are identified during analysis: ""Pro-environment discourse"", ""Keeping things as usual"" and ""Social and environmental concerns"". According to the results, employed respondents, were favorable to long-term forest and biodiversity conservation. In contrast, unemployed respondents were in favor of more immediate benefits while unemployed but educated respondents were in favor to both long-term forest conservation and immediate benefits from forests. This suggests that the lack of livelihoods for rural people is the main factor leading them to overharvest natural resources. These results suggest that biodiversity conservation of the Comoros archipelagos may benefit for plan aiming at (1) developing tourism and maintaining sustainable production of crops and livestock that could allow enhancing the livelihoods and well-being of all social groups, (2) developing projects such as local markets that could allow villagers to sell their agricultural production, (3) setting up awareness campaign for tree-planting and reforestation. Reforestation could allow re-establishing natural plants and make large trees available for long-term purposes."

Here we assess the efficacy of the program in terms of student success in the parent course. As PAL is an opt-in program, we employ propensity score matching techniques to account for confounding factors. Our analysis of 11 classes shows that PAL provides an average course GPA bump ranging from .23 to .71 grade points (mean .42). Compared to the non-PAL baseline course GPA, this amounts to an increase of 9% to 51% (mean 23%). We consider data from over 25,000 students, and our propensity score analysis uses over 10,000 students (4,519 PAL, 5,814 non-PAL) for whom appropriate matches could be found."

J.; Maggio, L. A.",Abigail  Konopasky,2021-06-14,scientific communication and education,"IntroductionWhile authorship plays a powerful role in the academy, research indicates many authors engage in questionable practices like honorary authorship. This suggests that authorship may be a contested space where individuals must exercise agency--a dynamic and emergent process, embedded in context--to negotiate potentially conflicting norms among published criteria, disciplines, and informal practices. This study explores how authors narrate their own and others agency in making authorship decisions.

MethodWe conducted a mixed-methods analysis of 24 first authors accounts of authorship decisions on a recent multi-author paper. Authors included 14 females and 10 males in health professions education (HPE) from U.S. and Canadian institutions (10 assistant, 6 associate, and 8 full professors). Analysis took place in three phases: (1) linguistic analysis of grammatical structures shown to be associated with agency (coding for main clause subjects and verb types); (2) narrative analysis to create a ""moral"" and ""title"" for each account; and (3) integration of (1) and (2).

ResultsParticipants narrated other authors most frequently as main clause subjects (n = 191), then themselves (I; n = 151), inanimate nouns (it, the paper; n = 146), and author team (we; n = 105). Three broad types of agency were narrated: distributed (n = 15 participants), focusing on how resources and work were spread across team members; individual (n = 6), focusing on the first authors action; and collaborative (n = 3), focusing on group actions. These three types of agency contained four sub-types, e.g., supported, contested, task-based, negotiated.

DiscussionThis study highlights the complex and emergent nature of agency narrated by authors when making authorship decisions. Published criteria offer us starting point--the stated rules of the authorship game; this paper offers us a next step--the enacted and narrated approach to the game."

While the official Software Carpentry curriculum is comprehensive, we found that it contains too much content for a two-day workshop. We also felt that the independent nature of the lessons left learners confused about how to integrate the newly acquired programming skills in their own work. Thus, we developed a new curriculum that aims to teach novices how to implement reproducible research principles in their own data analysis. The curriculum integrates live coding lessons with individual-level and group-based practice exercises, and also serves as a succinct resource that learners can reference both during and after the workshop. Moreover, it lowers the entry barrier for new instructors as they do not have to develop their own teaching materials or sift through extensive content. We developed this curriculum during a two-day sprint, successfully used it to host a two-day virtual workshop with almost 40 participants, and updated the material based on instructor and learner feedback.

To achieve that level of confidence, monitoring the stability of the microscope performance over time with standardized quality testing routines is essential for mining quantitative data. Three levels of microscope quality control procedures should be considered: i) usage of accessible and affordable tools and samples, ii) execution of easy and fast, preferably automatized, acquisition protocols, iii) analysis of data in the most automated way possible with adequate metrics for long-term monitoring. In this paper, we test the acquisition protocols on the mainly used microscope techniques (wide-field, spinning disk and confocal microscopy) with simple quality control tools. Seven protocols specify metrics on measuring the lateral and axial resolution (Point-Spread Function) of the system, field flatness, chromatic aberrations and co-registration, illumination power monitoring and stability, stage drift and positioning repeatability and finally temporal and spatial noise sources of camera detectors. We designed an ImageJ/FiJi java plugin named MetroloJ_QC to incorporate the identified metrics and automatize the data processing for the analysis. After processing and comparing the data of microscopes from more than ten imaging facilities, we test the robustness of the metrics and the protocols by determining experimental limit values. Our results give a first extensive characterization of the quality control procedures of a light microscope, with an automated data processing and experimental limit values that can be used by core facility staff and researchers to monitor the microscope performance over time."

Particularly, there has been an impetus to encode the dynamics of brain functioning by analyzing temporal information available in the fMRI data. Long-short term memory (LSTM), a class of machine learning model possessing a ""memory"" component, is increasingly being observed to perform well in various applications with dynamic temporal behavior, including brain state decoding. Because of the dynamics and inherent latency in fMRI BOLD responses, future temporal context is crucial. However, it is neither encoded nor captured by the conventional LSTM model. This paper performs robust brain state decoding via information encapsulation from both the past and future instances of fMRI data via bi-directional LSTM. This allows for explicitly modeling the dynamics of BOLD response without any delay adjustment. The two hidden activations of forward and reverse directions in bi-LSTM are collated to build the ""memory"" of the model and are used to robustly predict the brain states at every time instance. Working memory data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) is utilized for validation and was observed to perform 18% better than its unidirectional counterpart in terms of accuracy in predicting the brain states."

Such journalism shapes the publics view of the current state of science and legitimizes experts. Journalists can only cite and quote a limited number of sources, who they may discover in their research, including recommendations by other scientists. Biases in either process may influence who is identified and ultimately included as a source. To examine potential biases in science journalism, we analyzed 22,001 non-research articles published by Nature and compared these with Nature-published research articles with respect to predicted gender and name origin. We extracted cited authors names and those of quoted speakers. While citations and quotations within a piece do not reflect the entire information-gathering process, they can provide insight into the demographics of visible sources. We then predicted gender and name origin of the cited authors and speakers. We compared articles with a comparator set made up of first and last authors within primary research articles in Nature and a subset of Springer Nature articles in the same time period. In our analysis, we found a skew toward quoting men in Nature science journalism. However, quotation is trending toward equal representation at a faster rate than authorship rates in academic publishing. Gender disparity in Nature quotes was dependent on the article type. We found a significant over-representation of names with predicted Celtic/English origin and under-representation of names with a predicted East Asian origin in both in extracted quotes and journal citations but dampened in citations."

C.; Alejandro, W.; Menke, E.; Kranzfelder, P.",Petra  Kranzfelder,2021-06-22,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, many universities moved to emergency remote teaching (ERT). This allowed institutions to continue their instruction despite not being in person. However, ERT is not without consequences. For example, students may have inadequate technological supports, such as reliable internet and computers. Students may also have poor learning environments at home and may need to find added employment to support their families. Additionally, there were consequences to faculty. It has been shown that female instructors are more disproportionately impacted in terms of mental health issues and increased domestic labor.

This research aims to investigate instructors and students perceptions of their transition to ERT. Specifically, we wanted to: O_LIIdentify supports and barriers during the transition to ERT
C_LIO_LICompare instructors experiences with the student experiences
C_LIO_LIExplore these supports and barriers within the context of social presence, teaching presence, and/or cognitive presence during ERT as well as how these supports and barriers relate to scaffolding in emergency remote courses
C_LI

DesignUsing grounded theory techniques, we applied two-cycle, qualitative analyses to assess the instructor transcripts. In first-cycle analysis, we used open coding to develop initial ideas from the data. We then used second cycle coding to generate categories with definitions and criteria agreed upon during discussion-based consensus building. Finally, these categories and descriptions were used to code student survey data.

Analyses/InterpretationsInstructors identified twice as many barriers as supports in their teaching during the transition to ERT and identified casual and formal conversations with colleagues as valuable supports. Emerging categories for barriers consisted of academic integrity concerns as well as technological difficulties. Similarly, students identified more barriers than supports in their learning during the transition to ERT. More specifically, students described pre-existing course structure, classroom technology, and community as best supporting their learning. Barriers that challenged student learning included classroom environment, student availability, and student emotion and comfort.

ContributionTogether, this research will help us understand supports and barriers to teaching and learning during the transition to ERT. This understanding can help us better plan and prepare for future emergencies, particularly at MSIs, where improved communication and increased access to resources for both students and instructors are key."

Using cross-sectional data collected by the College Crisis Initiative of Davidson College, six levels of instructional modalities (ranked from least to most restrictive) were compared between Council on Education of Public Health (CEPH)-accredited and non-CEPH-accredited 4-year institutions. Institutions with CEPH-accredited schools and programs were more likely to select some restrictive teaching modalities: 63.8% more likely to use hybrid/hyflex or more restrictive and 66.9% more likely to be primarily online (with some in person) or more restrictive. However, having CEPH-accredited programs did not push institutions to the most restrictive modalities. COVID-19 cases in county, enrollment, and political affiliation of the state governor were also found to influence instructional modality selection. While any ecological study has certain limitations, this study demonstrates that college and university fall plans appear to have been influenced by the presence of CEPH-accredited schools and programs of public health, and/or the input of their faculty.

Pre-prints may serve as a conduit to immediately disseminating ones work, bypassing the arduous peer review process and its associated inherent biases. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to 1] compare the gender of first and last authors in pre-print versus peer reviewed publications, 2] examine the composition of first and last author pairs as stratified by publication type, and 3] examine the correlation between woman authorship and institutional geographic location and publication metrics stratified by publication type.

MethodsThe keyword ""oral health"" was used to search for publications in BioRxiv and Pubmed in the years 2018 and 2019. Gender of first and last authors were determined, and its frequency was considered as the primary outcome. Additionally, the geographic location of the authors associated institution and publication metrics measured by Altmetrics score were extracted. Data was descriptively summarized by frequencies and percentages. Chi-square analysis was conducted for categorical variables which included the relationship between gender and publication type as well as gender and region of authors associated institution. Binomial regression analysis was conducted to analyze the relationship between gender and Altmetrics.

ResultsWoman first authors comprised 40.3% of pre-prints and 64.5% of peer reviewed publications [p<0.05]. Woman last authors comprised 31.3% of pre-prints and 61.5% of peer reviewed publications [p<0.05]. When analyzing the relationships between first and last author, the Man-Man pairing represented 47.7% of the pre-print publications and the Woman-Woman pairing comprised a majority of the of the peer review publications at 47.5%. All results were statistically significant with a p-value <0.05. No significant correlation was found between region of institution or Altmetrics and gender of first or last authors [p>0.05].

ConclusionFor the first time in oral health science, it was found that women show higher representation as first and last author positions in peer reviewed publications versus pre-prints."

This experimental test used 1200 NIH grant applications, 400 from Black investigators, 400 matched applications from White investigators, and 400 randomly selected applications from White investigators. Applications were reviewed by mail in standard and redacted formats. Redaction reduced, but did not eliminate, reviewers ability to correctly guess features of identity. The primary, pre-registered analysis hypothesized a differential effect of redaction according to investigator race in the matched applications. A set of secondary analyses (not pre-registered) used the randomly selected applications from White scientists and tested the same interaction. Both analyses revealed similar effects: Standard format applications from White investigators scored better than those from Black investigators; redaction reduced the size of the difference by about half (e.g. from a Cohens d of 0.20 to 0.10 in matched applications); redaction caused applications from White scientists to score worse but had no effect on scores for Black applications. The primary statistical test of the study hypothesis was not significant; the secondary analysis was significant. The findings support further evaluation of peer review models that diminish the influence of applicant identity."

A.; Ruiz-Whalen, D.; O'Reilly, A. M.; Fried, N. T.",Nathan T. Fried,2021-06-30,scientific communication and education,"A call for the integration of research experiences into all biology curricula has been a major goal for educational reform efforts nationally. Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) have been the predominant method of accomplishing this, but their associated costs and complex design can limit their wide adoption. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic forced programs to identify unique ways to still provide authentic research experiences while students were virtual. We report here a full guide for the successful implementation of a semester-long virtual CURE that uses Drosophila behavioral assays to explore the connection between pain and addiction with the use of a ""lab-in-a-box"" sent home to students. Individual components were piloted across three semesters and launched as a 100-level introductory course with 19 students. We found that this course increased science identity and successfully improved key research competencies as per the Undergraduate Research Student Self-Assessment (URSSA) survey. This course is ideal for flipped classrooms ranging from introductory biology to upper-level neuroscience courses and can be integrated directly into the lecture period without the need for building a new course. Given the low cost, recent comfort with virtual learning environments, and the current proliferation of flipped biology classrooms following the 2020 pandemic, this curriculum could serve as an ideal project-based active-learning tool for equitably increasing access to authentic research experiences."

The growing number of operational and planned hydroelectrics requires robust scientific evidence to evaluate impacts of these projects on Amazonian vertebrates. Here we investigated the existing scientific knowledge base documenting impacts of hydropower developments on vertebrates across Brazilian Amazonia.

MethodsWe reviewed the scientific literature from 1945 to 2020 published in English, Spanish and Portuguese to assess the temporal and spatial patterns in publications and the types of study design adopted as well as scientific evidence presented.

ResultsA total of 24 published articles documented impacts on fish (n = 20), mammals (n = 3) and freshwater turtles (n = 1). Most study designs (87.5%) lacked appropriate controls and only three studies adopted more robust Before-After-Control-Impact designs. The published evidence did not generally support causal inference with only two studies (8.3%) including appropriate controls and/or confounding variables.

ConclusionDecades of published assessments (54.2% of which were funded by hydropower developers or their subsidiaries) do not appear to have established robust evidence of impacts of hydropower developments on Amazonian vertebrates. This lack of robust evidence could limit the development of effective minimization and mitigation actions for the diverse vertebrate groups impacted by hydroelectrics across Brazilian Amazonia.

Implications for ConservationTo avoid misleading inferences there is a need to integrate more robust study designs into impact assessments of hydropower developments in the Brazilian Amazon."

In this study, we investigate the effect of the broad adoption of virtual platforms for academic conferences as a response to COVID-19 restrictions. We show that virtual platforms enable higher participation from underrepresented minority groups, increased inclusion, and broader geographic distribution. We also discuss emerging challenges associated with the virtual conference format resulting in a decreased engagement of social activities, limited possibilities of cross-fertilization between participants, and reduced peer-to-peer interactions. Lastly, we conclude that a novel comprehensive approach needs to be adopted by the conference organizers to ensure increased accessibility, diversity, and inclusivity of post-pandemic conferences. Our findings provide evidence favoring a hybrid format for future conferences, marrying the strength of both in-person and virtual platforms."

They are a major reason for poor overall health and decreased quality of life. Sleep medicine education is limited at most medical schools, resulting in limited awareness of this important aspect of healthcare. The aim of the study is to assess sleep medicine knowledge of graduating medical students in Lebanon and to assess their readiness to tackle sleep health issues in a country during an unprecedented crisis.

MethodsFinal-year medical students at 7 medical schools in Lebanon were invited to fill a survey between January 2020 and March 2021. The Assessment of Sleep Knowledge in Medical Education survey was used to assess their knowledge in sleep medicine. The curriculum organizers at the medical schools were also surveyed. Students t-test was used for analysis.

Results158 and 58 students completed the survey during 2020 and 2021, with a mean overall score on sleep knowledge of was 17.5 and 15.9 /30, respectively. There was no difference in mean knowledge scores by gender, age, American versus European medical school systems, and between medical schools that included sleep medicine in their curriculum versus those that did not.

ConclusionsPresence of sleep medicine education in the curriculum was associated with higher scores on ASKME among graduating Lebanese medical students. Overall, the new crop of physicians in Lebanon possesses a relatively good knowledge base in sleep medicine. Nevertheless, more effort should be made to uniformly maintain this level of sleep education."

Often minor results and details are lost in a systematic screen, which is becoming even more frequent with the rapidly rising numbers of daily published scientific articles. We developed the PDF Data Extractor (PDE) R package to aid scientists at any stage in literature reviews while offering a user-friendly interface. The tool permits the user to categorize large numbers of full-text articles in PDF format, export containing tables to Excel sheets (pdf2table), and extract relevant data using a simple user interface, requiring no bioinformatics skills. Specific features of the literature analysis comprise the adaptability of analysis parameters including the use of regular expressions, machine learning-powered detection of abbreviations of search words in articles, and the export of document meta-data. We exemplify how the PDE R package can be utilized as a pre-screening tool allowing automated categorization of full-text articles by relevance, thereby reducing the literature to be evaluated (in our example by 35% with a sensitivity of 100% at standard parameters).

K.; Ross-Hellauer, T.; Stein, G.",Gabriel  Stein,2021-07-15,scientific communication and education,"Peer review of a research product varies widely depending on the publishers and platforms involved in the process. As scholarly publishing is disrupted by new innovations, peer review processes become more heterogeneous, placing an increasing burden on the researcher in understanding how they can communicate their scholarship. New ways to model such processes, and increase transparency, trust, and experimentation in scholarly publishing are needed. Many are emerging but can tend to focus on the needs of creators, and not those of readers, funders, and the whole scholarly publishing ecosystem. They may not place focus on representing editorial practices in ways that can be reliably aggregated, surfaced, and queried; are often limited to traditional peer review processes; and cannot capture the full range of editorial practices and events needed to accommodate alternative publication, review, and curation models. To support researchers in a world of experimentation in scholarly publishing, we propose a machine-readable, extensible, and discoverable framework for representing and surfacing review and editorial processes. Working with a Technical Committee composed of interested parties by employing a modified Delphi Method, we developed initial guiding principles and proposals towards an object-level editorial metadata framework compatible with a broad range of possible futures for scholarly publishing. We present the results of this process with a proposal and example use cases for DocMaps, a framework for representing object-level assertions."

B.; Theobald, E. J.; Velasco, V.; Freeman, S.",Scott  Freeman,2021-07-21,scientific communication and education,"Evolution by natural selection is recognized as both the most important concept in undergraduate biology and the most difficult to teach. Unfortunately, teaching and assessment of evolution have been impaired by legacy approaches that focus on Darwins original insights and the Modern Synthesis integration of Mendelian genetics, but ignore or downplay advances from what we term the Molecular Synthesis. To create better alignment between instructional approaches and contemporary research in the biosciences, we propose that the primary learning goal in teaching evolution should be for students to connect genotypes, phenotypes, and fitness. To support this approach, we developed and tested assessment questions and scoring rubrics called the Extended Assessing Conceptual Reasoning of Natural Selection (E-ACORNS) instrument. Initial E-ACORNS data suggest that after traditional instruction, few students recognize the molecular synthesis--prompting us to propose that introductory course sequences be re-organized with the molecular synthesis as their central theme."

We use a sequential adoption model that accounts for differences between forward-looking adopters, who consider future impacts of their learning, and myopic adopters, who only consider past learning. We apply the analysis to three panels of U.S. soybean farmers representing different stages of the genetically modified (GM) seed technology diffusion path. We show that uncertainty is considerably reduced over time due to increased learning efficiency. Our results indicate that a forward-looking model fits the early adopters and early majority stages better, while both models perform equally well in the laggard stage.

Through weekly discussions among observers, we adjusted six of the original instructor COPUS code descriptions and six of the original student code descriptions to fit the online learning environment. We trained 23 observers to conduct E-COPUS utilizing both in-person and online lecture recordings. To validate E- COPUS, we consulted an expert panel of science educators and education researchers to provide feedback on our code descriptions and complete a matching activity with our E-COPUS code descriptions. We further examined E-COPUS by analyzing the teaching and learning practices of 6 instructors across in-person and online instruction and found that the online functions of breakout rooms, polling, and the chat were utilized to promote active learning activities in the online learning environment. As we prepare for teaching in the future, it is important to have formative assessment tools designed for all course formats to support assessment and improvement of teaching practices in college STEM classrooms."

Dog denial of entry reports from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2020, stored within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Quarantine Activity Reporting System, were reviewed. Basic descriptive statistics were used to analyze the data. Reason for denial, country of origin, and month of importation were all examined to determine which countries of origin resulted in the largest number of denials, and whether there was a seasonal change in importations during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020), compared to previous years (2018 and 2019). During 2020, CDC denied entry to 458 dogs. This represents a 52% increase in dogs denied entry compared to the averages in 2018 and 2019. Dogs were primarily denied entry for falsified rabies vaccination certificates (56%). Three countries exported 74% of all dogs denied entry into the United States, suggesting that targeted interventions may be needed for certain countries. Increased attempts to import inadequately vaccinated dogs from countries with canine rabies in 2020 may have been due to the increased demand for domestic pets during the COVID-19 pandemic. Educational messaging should highlight the risk of rabies and the importance of making informed pet purchases from foreign entities to protect pet owners, their families, and the public."

R.",Lauren A Maggio,2021-07-26,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundThe field of medical education remains poorly delineated such that there is no broad consensus of the articles and journals that comprise ""the field."" This lack of consensus has implications for conducting bibliometric studies and other research designs (e.g., systematic reviews); it also challenges the field to compare citation scores in the field and across others and for an individual to identify themselves as ""a medical education researcher."" Other fields have utilized bibliometric field delineation, which is the assigning of articles or journals to a certain field in an effort to define that field.

ProcessIn this Research Approach, three bibliometric field delineation approaches -- information retrieval, core journals, and journal co-citation -- are introduced. For each approach, the authors describe their attempt to apply it in the medical education context and identify related strengths and weaknesses. Based on co-citation, the authors propose the Medical Education Journal List 24 (MEJ-24), as a starting point for delineating medical education and invite the community to collaborate on improving and potentially expanding this list.

PearlsAs a research approach, field delineation is complicated, and there is no clear best way to delineate the field of medical education. However, recent advances in information and computer science provide potentially more fruitful approaches to deal with the complexity of the field. When considering these emerging approaches, researchers should consider collaborating with bibliometricians.

Bibliometric approaches rely on available metadata for articles and journals, which necessitates that researchers examine the metadata prior to analysis to understand its strengths and weaknesses, and to assess how this might affect their data interpretation. While using bibliometric approaches for field delineation is valuable, it is important to remember that these techniques are only as good as the research teams interpretation of the data, which suggests that an expanded research approach is needed to better delineate medical education, an approach that includes active discussion within the medical education community."

The vastness of the scientific literature has been commonly blamed for this phenomenon, despite recent improvements in information retrieval and text mining. Its actual negative impact on scientific progress, however, has never been quantified. This analysis attempts to do so by exploring its effects on biomedical discovery, particularly in the discovery of relations between diseases, genes and chemical compounds. Results indicate that the probability that two scientific facts will enable the discovery of a new fact depends on how far apart these two facts were published within the scientific landscape. In particular, the probability decreases exponentially with the citation distance. Thus, the direction of scientific progress is distorted based on the location in which each scientific fact is published, representing a path-dependent bias in which originally closely-located discoveries drive the sequence of future discoveries. To counter this bias, scientists should open the scope of their scientific work with modern computational approaches."

A.; Driessen, E.; Maggio, L. A.",Lauren A Maggio,2021-07-28,scientific communication and education,"PurposeRecent calls to improve transparency in peer review have prompted examination of many aspects of the peer review process. Peer review systems often allow confidential comments to editors that could reduce transparency to authors, yet this option has escaped scrutiny. Our study explores 1) how reviewers use the confidential comments section and 2) alignment between comments to the editor and comments to authors with respect to content and tone.

MethodsOur dataset included 358 reviews of 168 manuscripts submitted between January 1, 2019 and August 24, 2020 to a health professions education journal with a single blind review process. We first identified reviews containing comments to the editor. Then, for the reviews with comments, we used procedures consistent with conventional and directed qualitative content analysis to develop a coding scheme and code comments for content, tone, and section of the manuscript. For reviews in which the reviewer recommended ""reject,"" we coded for alignment between reviewers comments to the editor and to authors. We report descriptive statistics.

Results49% of reviews contained comments to the editor (n=176). Most of these comments summarized the reviewers impression of the article (85%), which included explicit reference to their recommended decision (44%) and suitability for the journal (10%). The majority of comments addressed argument quality (56%) or research design/methods/data (51%). The tone of comments tended to be critical (40%) or constructive (34%). For the 48 reviews recommending ""reject,"" the majority of comments to the editor contained content that also appeared in comments to the authors (65%); additional content tended to be irrelevant to the manuscript. Tone frequently aligned (85%).

ConclusionFindings indicate variability in how reviewers use the confidential comments to editor section in online peer review systems, though generally the way they use them suggests integrity and transparency to authors."

H.",Christoph H Emmerich,2021-08-03,scientific communication and education,"Laboratory workflows and preclinical models have become increasingly diverse and complex. Confronted with the dilemma of assessing a multitude of information with ambiguous relevance for their specific experiments, scientists run the risk of overlooking critical factors that can influence the planning, conduct and results of studies and that should have been considered a priori. Negligence of such crucial information may result in sub-optimal study design and study execution, bringing into question the validity of generated outcomes. As a corollary, a lot of resources are wasted on biomedical research that turns out to be irreproducible and not sufficiently robust for further project development.

To address this problem, we present  PEERS (Platform for the Exchange of Experimental Research Standards), an open-access online platform that is built to aid scientists in determining which experimental factors and variables are most likely to affect the outcome of a specific test, model or assay and therefore ought to be considered during the design, execution and reporting stages.

The PEERS database is categorized into in vivo and in vitro experiments and provides lists of factors derived from scientific literature that have been deemed critical for experimentation. Most importantly, the platform is based on a structured and transparent system for rating the strength of evidence related to each identified factor and its relevance for a specific method/model. In this context, the rating procedure will not solely be limited to the PEERS working group but will also allow for a community-based grading of evidence.

To generate a proof-of-concept that the PEERS approach is feasible, we focused on a set of in vitro and in vivo methods from the neuroscience field, which are presented in this article. On the basis of the Open Field paradigm in rodents, we describe the selection of factors specific to each experimental setup and the rating system, but also discuss the identification of additional general items that transcend categories and individual tests. Moreover, we present a working format of the PEERS prototype with its structured information framework for embedding data and critical back end/front end user functionalities. Here, PEERS not only offers users the possibility to search for information to facilitate experimental rigor, but also draws on the engagement of the scientific community to actively expand the information contained within the platform through a standardized approach to data curation and knowledge engineering.

As the database grows and benefits become more apparent, we will expand the scope of PEERS to any area of applied biomedical research.

Collectively, by helping scientists to search for specific factors relevant to their experiments, and to share experimental knowledge in a standardized manner, PEERS will serve as the ultimate exchange and analysis tool to enhance data validity and robustness as well as the reproducibility of preclinical research. PEERS offers a vetted, independent tool by which to judge the quality of information available on a certain test or model, identifies knowledge gaps and provides guidance on the key methodological considerations that should be prioritized to ensure that preclinical research is conducted to the highest standards and best practice."

This is not only harmful for students learning in the short-term but may impact on students career prospects and widen social inequalities. Delaying school start times has been shown to improve sleep but whether this translates to better achievement is unresolved. The current evidence is limited due to a plethora of outcome measures and the many factors influencing sleep and grade/score trajectories. Here, we studied whether 0.5-1.5 years of exposure to a flexible school start system, with the daily choice of an 8AM or 8:50AM-start (intervention), allowed secondary school students (n=63-157, 14-19 years) to improve their quarterly school grades in a 4-year longitudinal pre-post design. We investigated whether sleep, changes in sleep or frequency of later starts predicted grade improvements in the flexible system. Our mixed model regressions with 5,111-16,724 official grades as outcomes did not indicate meaningful grade improvements in the flexible system per se or with previously observed sleep variables (nor their changes) - the covariates academic quarter, discipline and grade level had a greater, more systematic effect in our sample. Importantly, this finding does not preclude improvements in learning and cognition in our sample. However, at the  dose received here, intermittent sleep benefits did not obviously translate into detectable grade changes, which is in line with several other studies and highlights that grades are suboptimal to evaluate timetabling interventions despite their importance for future success.

Significance statementEarly school start times worldwide clash with teenagers delayed sleep-wake rhythms. This mismatch results in sleep restrictions below healthy amounts, which compromises health and performance and further aggravates social disparities. Since adequate sleep is important for learning and concentration, there is the strong expectation that counteracting sleep deprivation with delayed school starts results in better academic achievement. We add important high-resolution, longitudinal data to this unresolved scientific debate. When controlling for confounders, our results do not support that improved sleep leads to grade changes within 1.5 years in a flexible start system. While grades are suboptimal to measure later school start effects on performance, they nevertheless open doors to higher education worldwide and thus determine future trajectories."

Implicit within the treaty is the idea that mega-biodiverse countries will provide genetic resources and grant access to them and scientists in high-income countries will use these resources and share back benefits. However, little research has been conducted on how this framework is reflected in real-life scientific practice. Currently, parties to the CBD) are debating whether or not digital sequence information (DSI) should be regulated under a new benefit-sharing framework. At this critical time point in the upcoming international negotiations, we test the fundamental hypothesis of provision and use by looking at the global patterns of access and use in scientific publications. Our data reject the provider-user relationship and suggest far more complex information flow for digital sequence information. Therefore, any new policy decisions on digital sequence information should be aware of the high level of use of DSI across low- and middle-income countries and seek to preserve open access to this crucial common good."

A.; Stanhope, J.; Breed, M. F.",Martin F Breed,2021-08-06,scientific communication and education,"Harnessing new technologies is vital to achieve global imperatives to restore degraded ecosystems. We explored the potential of genomics as one such tool. We aimed to understand barriers hindering the uptake of genomics, and how to overcome them, via exploratory interviews with leading scholars in both restoration and its sister discipline of conservation - a discipline that has successfully leveraged genomics. We also conducted an examination of research trends to explore some insights that emerged from the interviews, including publication trends that have used genomics to address restoration and conservation questions. Our qualitative findings revealed varied perspectives in harnessing genomics. For example, scholars in restoration without genomics experience felt genomics was over-hyped. Scholars with genomics experience emphatically emphasised the need to proceed cautiously in using genomics in restoration. Both genomics-experienced and less-experienced scholars called for case studies to demonstrate the benefits of genomics in restoration. These qualitative data contrasted with our examination of research trends, which revealed 70 restoration genomics studies, particularly studies using environmental DNA as a monitoring tool. We provide a roadmap to facilitate the uptake of genomics into restoration, to help the restoration sector meet the monumental task of restoring huge areas to biodiverse and functional ecosystems."

L.",Ashley L Juavinett,2021-08-10,scientific communication and education,"Understanding the skill sets required for career paths is a prerequisite for preparing students for those careers. Neuroscience career paths are rapidly changing as the field expands and increasingly overlaps with computational and data-heavy job sectors. With the steady growth in neuroscience trainees and the diversification of jobs for those trainees, it is important to assess whether or not our training is matching the skill sets required in the workforce. Here, we surveyed hundreds of neuroscience professionals and graduate students to assess their use and valuation of a range of skills, from bench skills to communication and management. We find that professionals with neuroscience degrees can be clustered into three main groups based on their skill sets: academic research, industry research and technical work, and non-research. Further, we find that while graduate students do not use or highly value management and communication skills, almost all neuroscience professionals report strongly needing those skills. Finally, coding and data analysis skills are widely used in academic and industry research and predict higher salaries. Our findings can help trainees assess their own skill sets as well as encourage educational leaders to offer training in management and communication-skills which may help catapult trainees into the next stages of their careers."

MethodsWe searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, and CBM databases from inception to July 2021. Meta-analysis was conducted using STATA version 14.0 and Review Manager version 5.3 softwares. We calculated the weighted mean differences(WMD) to analyze the change of ocular axial length (AL) between orthokeratology combined with 0.01% atropine (OKA) and orthokeratology (OA) alone. The Cochran s Q-statistic and I2 test were used to evaluate potential heterogeneity between studies. To evaluate the influence of single studies on the overall estimate, a sensitivity analysis was performed. We also performed sub group and meta-regression analyses to investigate potential sources of heterogeneity. We conducted Begger s funnel plots and Egger s linear regression tests to investigate publication bias.

ResultsNine studies that met all inclusion criteria were included in this meta-analysis. A total of 191 children in OKA group and 196 children in OK group were assessed. The pooled summary WMD of AL change was -0.90(95%CI=-1.25[~]-0.55) with statistical significance(t=-5.03, p<0.01), which indicated there was obvious difference between OKA and OK in myopic children. Subgroup analysis also showed that OKA treatment resulted in significantly less axial elongation compared to OK treatment alone according to SER. We found no evidence for publication bias.

ConclusionsOur meta-analysis indicates 0.01% atropine atropine is effective in slowing axial elongation in myopia children with orthokeratology."

C.; Shiffman, D. S.",Lisa  B  Whitenack,2021-08-18,scientific communication and education,"Despite evidence of their importance to marine ecosystems, at least 25% of all chondrichthyan species are estimated or assessed as threatened with extinction. In addition to the logistical difficulties of effectively conserving wide-ranging marine species, shark conservation is believed to have been hindered in the past by public perceptions of sharks as dangerous to humans. Shark Week is a high-profile, international programming event that has potentially enormous influence on public perceptions of sharks, shark research, shark researchers, and shark conservation. However, Shark Week has received regular criticism for poor factual accuracy, fearmongering, bias, and inaccurate representations of science and scientists. This research analyzes the content and titles of Shark Week episodes across its entire 32 years of programming to determine if there are trends in species covered, research techniques featured, expert identity, conservation messaging, type of programming, and portrayal of sharks. We analyzed titles from 272 episodes (100%) of Shark Week programming and the content of all available (201; 73.9%) episodes. Our data demonstrate that the majority of episodes are not focused on shark bites, although such shows are common and many Shark Week programs frame sharks around fear, risk, and adrenaline. While anecdotal descriptions of disproportionate attention to particular charismatic species (e.g. great whites, bull sharks, and tiger sharks) are accurate and supported by data, 79 shark species have been featured briefly at least once. Shark Weeks depictions of research and of scientists are biased towards a small set of (typically visual and expensive) research methodologies and (mostly white, mostly male) scientists, including presentation of many white male non-scientists as experts. While sharks are more often portrayed negatively than positively, limited conservation messaging does appear in 53% of episodes analyzed. Results suggest that as a whole, while Shark Week is likely contributing to the collective perception of sharks as monsters, even relatively small alterations to programming decisions could substantially improve the presentation of sharks and shark science and conservation issues."

The succession and composition of grasslands ecosystems worldwide have significantly been affected by the accelerated changes in the environment due to natural and anthropogenic activities. Therefore, understanding spatial data on the succession of grassland vegetation species and communities through mapping and monitoring is essential to gain knowledge on the ecosystem and other ecosystem services. This study used a random forest machine learning classifier on the Google Earth Engine platform to classify grass vegetation species with Landsat 7 ETM+ and ASTER multispectral imager (MI) data resampled with the current Sentinel-2 MSI data to map and estimate the changes in vegetation species succession. The results indicate that ASTER IM has the least accuracy of 72%, Landsat 7 ETM+ 84%, and Sentinel-2 had the highest of 87%. The result also show that other species had replaced four dominant grass species totaling an area of about 49 km2 throughout the study."

A.; Sarrafzadeh, M.",Simon  Wakeling,2021-08-20,scientific communication and education,"Recent research demonstrates that Australia lags in providing open access to research outputs. In Australia, while the two major research funding bodies require open access of outputs from projects they fund, these bodies only fund a small proportion of research conducted. The major source of research and experimental development funding in Australian higher education is general university, or institutional, funding, and such funds are not subject to national funder open access policies. Thus, institutional policies and other institutional supports for open access are important in understanding Australias OA position. The purpose of this paper is, therefore, to understand the characteristics of Australian institutional open access policies and to explore the extent they represent a coherent and unified approach to delivering and promoting open access in Australia. Open access policies were located using a systematic web search approach and then their contents were analysed. Only half of Australian universities were found to have an open access policy. There was a wide variation in language used, expressed intent of the policy and expectations of researchers. Few policies mention monitoring or compliance and only three mention consequences for non-compliance. While it is understandable that institutions develop their own policies, when language is used which does not reflect national and international understandings, when requirements are not clear and with consequences, policies are unlikely to contribute to understanding of open access, to uptake of the policy, or to ease of transferring understanding and practices between institutions. A more unified approach to open access is recommended."

Pre-activity lectures introduced fundamentals of protein secondary structure and provided context for the research projects, while a homework assignment familiarized students with 3D visualization of biomolecules using UCSF Chimera, a free protein structure viewer. The activity is an online survey in which students compare structure elements in papain, a well-characterized cysteine protease from Carica papaya, to novel homologous proteases identified from the genomes of an extremophilic microbe (Halanaerobium praevalens) and two carnivorous plants (Drosera capensis and Cephalotus follicularis). Students were then able to identify, with varying levels of accuracy, a number of structural features in cysteine proteases that could expedite the identification of novel or biochemically interesting cysteine proteases for experimental validation in a university laboratory. Student responses to a post-activity survey were largely positive and constructive, describing points in the activity that could be improved and indicating that the activity helped them learn about protein structure."

Different combinations of symptom variables yield different combinations of herbs to form a myriad of prescriptions, and they have undergone repeated confirmation and are worthy objects of excavation and analysis. Herbal studies on stroke have developed from genomics to transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics, yet more thought is needed on putting time in a wider perspective of the symptoms and herbs for stroke in Chinese medicine.

Due to this, we studied the dynamic structure of TCM prescriptions on stroke, using over 270 TCM prescription books containing 2231 prescriptions related to stroke recorded from 341 to 2000 CE. We labeled the functions of the prescriptions with the symptoms based on subject terms in MESH Neurologic Manifestations, then standardized the herbs in the prescriptions, and finally connected the co-occurring symptoms and herbs in the prescriptions to build an undirected complex network. The Stroke Symptom-Herb Networks (SSHNs) can be seen from its network characteristics that it is not a random network and has small-world characteristics. It has experienced two peaks in its nearly 1700-year history, during the Song dynasty, the Ming and Qing dynasties. From 600 years onwards, the core herb cluster has been initially formed. The comparison of sub-network similarities allowed us to identify several symptoms with similar herb clusters.

We divided the community based on modularity, and by analyzing the community evolution, we found a more fixed historical evolutionary trend with Hemiplegia and Sialorrhea nodes and their associated symptom and herb nodes. In the time series analysis, we found many symptom-herb combinations that were consistently closely related to historic time depends on assessing the similarity between the symptoms and the herbs. The complex network provides a distinctive perspective for understanding the symptom-herb relationships embedded in TCM prescriptions in remote antiquity."

L.",Christopher LR Barratt,2021-08-24,scientific communication and education,"TitleResearch Funding for Male Reproductive Health and Infertility in the UK and USA [2016 - 2019]

Study questionWhat is the research funding for male reproductive health and infertility in the UK and US between 2016 to 2019?

Summary answerThe average funding for a research project in male reproductive health and infertility was not significantly different to that for female-based projects ({pound}653,733 in the UK and $779,707 in the US). However, only 0.07% and 0.83% of government funds from NIHR (UK) and NICHD (USA) was granted for male reproductive health, respectively.

What is known alreadyThere is a marked paucity of data on research funding for male reproductive health.

Study design, size, durationExamined government databases over a total 4-year period from January 2016 to December 2019.

Participants/materials, setting, methodsInformation on the funding provided to male-based and female-based research was collected using public accessed web-databases from the UKRI-GTR, the NIHRs Open Data Summary, and the US NIH RePORT. Funded projects that began research activity between January 2016 to December 2019 were recorded, along with their grant and project details. Strict inclusion-exclusion criteria were followed for both UK and US data with a primary research focus of male infertility, reproductive health and disorders, and contraception development. Funding support was divided into three research groups: male-based, female-based, and not-specified research. Between the 4-year period, the UK is divided into 5 funding periods, starting from 2015/16 to 2019/20, and the US is divided into 5 fiscal years, from 2016 to 2020.

Main results and the role of chanceBetween January 2016 to December 2019, UK agencies awarded a total of {pound}11,767,190 to 18 projects for male-based research and {pound}29,850,945 to 40 projects for female-based research. There was no statistically significant difference in funding average between the two research groups (P=0.56, W=392). The US NIH funded 76 projects totaling $59,257,746 for male-based research and 99 projects totaling $83,272,898 for female-based research. There was no statistically significant difference in funding average between the two groups (P=0.83, W=3834).

Limitations, reasons for cautionThe findings of this study cannot be used to generalize and reflect global funding trends towards infertility and reproductive health as the data collected followed a narrow funding timeframe from government agencies and only two countries. Other funding sources such as charities, industry and major philanthropic organizations were not evaluated.

Wider implications of the findingsThis is the first study examining funding granted by main government research agencies from the UK and US for male reproductive health. This study should stimulate further discussion of the challenges of tackling male infertility and reproductive health disorders and formulate appropriate investment strategies.

The objective of this study was to assess the measurement properties, summarize and describe the instruments that evaluate the use of EBP in health professionals, currently available through the update of the systematic review. The study was conducted and reported according to recommendations of the PRISMA checklist. A systematic search was conducted in the databases: PubMed, Embase, CINAHL and ERIC. In addition, three groups of search terms: EBP terms; evaluation; cross-cultural adaptation and measurement proprieties. They included studies that showed assessment tools of EBP in healthcare workers in general publication of full-text scientific articles, which tested the measurement properties and publication of an article in English. Searches included published studies from 2006 until July 2020. Evaluation of the methodological quality of the studies was conducted according to the COSMIN initiative. 92 studies were included. Forty new instruments have been identified to assess EBP. From these, most were developed for nursing professionals and physiotherapists. More than 48% of studies have American and Australian English as their native language. Only 28% of the studies included students in the samples. Reliability was considered appropriate (sufficient) in 76% of the instruments. The COSMIN checklist classified 7 (seven) instruments as being suitable for use in the target audience. However, Fresno Test remains the most appropriate instrument for assessing the use of EBP in healthcare professionals. 40 new instruments that assess EBP have been identified. Most are consistent and reliable for measuring the use of EBP in healthcare professionals. The Fresno Test, in a list of seven reliable and valid instruments for analysis, remains the most used and the one that most assesses the domains of EBP."

In this paper we describe the use of a series of peer teaching workshops as a strategy to respond to the bioinformatics training needs at a research-intensive institution. In addition to the data collected from the workshops, we also used personal experiences of researchers who participated as peer teachers to understand the incentives, challenges, and benefits of peer teaching. Developing communication skills such as confidence in teaching, explaining complex concepts, and better understanding of the topic emerged as primary benefits that the teachers obtained from this experience. Lack of time for teaching and the struggles of classroom management were identified as two major challenges. We suggest that peer teaching can be beneficial not only to train researchers in bioinformatics, but also as a professional development opportunity for graduate students and postdoctoral trainees."

Baille,2021-08-31,scientific communication and education,"Increasing commercial and recreational use of the worlds ocean leads to growing concerns on vessel and marine mammal encounters. For endangered species, like the North Atlantic right whale (NARW), vessel strikes can be responsible for the majority of the recorded deaths. Reducing the number of vessel strikes is key to improve North Atlantic right whale protection and a number of mitigation methods have been proposed and implemented. In this manuscript, we developed an agent-based model to assess the effectiveness of surface-based whale detection methods for vessel strike mitigation. We find that the effectiveness of such systems varies highly depending on the vessels speed and maneuverability. We also find that if vessel-based whale detection systems are used in conjunction with other mitigation measures such as general speed restrictions, they can be very effective and could lead to a significant decrease in vessel strikes when deployed at a large-scale."

J.",Ewan St. John Smith,2021-09-06,scientific communication and education,"Chronic gastrointestinal (GI) tract conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are common conditions associated with disordered bowel movements and significant pain. However, discussion of bowel habits is often regarded as taboo and public understanding of what exactly IBD, IBS and related conditions are, and how they impact the lives of those individuals with such conditions is poorly understood. To provide a platform for enhancing public engagement of chronic bowel conditions, a short film was made (Gut Reaction) examining the lives of four individuals with different bowel conditions and what scientists and clinicians are doing to help alleviate the pain experienced by such individuals. This film was then screened at a science festival where a pre- and post-film survey was conducted alongside follow up semi-structured interviews with a small subset of those who had expressed willingness to engage in such an interview. Although films have been used for public engagement and health campaigns, there is a lack of a robust evaluation of such methods. As such, there is no knowledge of impacts and outcomes, jeopardising funding of such projects. Overall, the pre- and post-film surveys demonstrated that the film had increased the attendees understanding of chronic bowel conditions, how they are treated, what research is on-going and the likelihood of discussing bowel conditions with friends and family. The follow-up interviews were analysed through the constant comparative coding process. The analysis revealed that participants have a strong belief that bowel conditions need to be part of normal conversations, and the understanding of such conditions, and the people who experience them, needs to be improved by society. Our participants hold that this is crucial for people who experience from such conditions, not least to be able to access help sooner and suffer less. Finally, our participants discussed two strategies to achieve this societal openness and tackle the sense of shame around these issues: one involving role models and the other the media. In summary, Gut Reaction appeared to have met its objectives of improving the viewers awareness and understanding of chronic bowel conditions, as well as removing some of the stigma and taboo that surround discussions about these conditions."

Recent studies have found that journal articles that were previously posted to bioRxiv received a higher number of citations or mentions/shares on other online platforms compared to articles in the same journals that were not posted. However, the exact causal mechanism for this effect has not been established, and may in part be related to authors biases in the selection of articles that are chosen to be posted as preprints. We aimed to investigate this mechanism by conducting a mixed-methods survey of 1,444 authors of bioRxiv preprints, to investigate the reasons that they post or do not post certain articles as preprints, and to make comparisons between articles they choose to post and not post as preprints. We find that authors are most strongly motivated to post preprints to increase awareness of their work and increase the speed of its dissemination; conversely, the strongest reasons for not posting preprints centre around a lack of awareness of preprints and reluctance to publicly post work that has not undergone a peer review process. We additionally find weak evidence that authors preferentially select their highest quality, most novel or most significant research to post as preprints, however, authors retain an expectation that articles they post as preprints will receive more citations or be shared more widely online than articles not posted."

Yet we are only beginning to understand what contributes to graduate student anxiety. Biology Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTAs) have simultaneous roles as teachers, researchers, students, and employees, and factors associated with these tasks may contribute to anxieties in graduate school, particularly in relation to teaching and research responsibilities. To explore factors related to GTA teaching and research anxieties, and guided by social cognitive career theory, we interviewed 23 Biology GTAs at a research-intensive southeastern university. Thematic analysis of interview transcripts revealed five major factors related to GTA anxieties: negative impact on self, negative impact on others, lack of self-efficacy, role tension, and personal anxieties. Lack of self-efficacy was most prevalent for research anxieties, compared to teaching anxieties, where the impact on others (e.g. students) was most prevalent. In research contexts, GTAs with academic career aspirations expressed less anxiety about role tensions compared to GTAs with non-academic career goals. By investigating GTA anxieties, this work can inform professional development or mental health interventions for GTAs and encourage greater awareness and dialogue about mental health issues in academia."

To combat shortages of N95 respirators, many institutions were forced to decontaminate and reuse respirators. While several reports have evaluated the impact on filtration as a measurement of preservation of respirator function after decontamination, the equally important fact of maintaining proper fit to the users face has been understudied. In the current study, we demonstrate the complete inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 and preservation of fit test performance of N95 respirators following treatment with dry heat. We apply scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements, Raman spectroscopy, and contact angle measurements to analyze filter material changes as a consequence of different decontamination treatments. We further compared the integrity of the respirator after autoclaving versus dry heat treatment via quantitative fit testing and found that autoclaving, but not dry heat, causes the fit of the respirator onto the users face to fail, thereby rendering the decontaminated respirator unusable. Our findings highlight the importance to account for both efficacy of disinfection and mask fit when reprocessing respirators to for clinical redeployment."

As an example, and support for future conferences, the decision process to switch during the COVID-19 pandemic from onsite to online, the conception and tools, the experiences of the organisers and the feedback of the participants are described.

MethodsThe CERN tool ""Indico"" served as the central conference management system including public homepage, submission and payment system, abstract review and decision platform, and conference material repository. Zoom, YouTube Live and Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) were utilised for keynotes and other presentation sessions, including livestreaming of pre-recorded presentations. Gather was implemented for poster sessions and individual meetings. An anonymous survey included Likert-type questions on acceptance and quality of the tools and instructions, open questions related to positive and negative issues, and ideas for the next online-conference.

ResultsThe event was evaluated well, with mostly fluently working technical solutions. A few participants indicated problems switching from YouTube to Zoom between presentations and discussions. Opinions on pre-recordings of talks were divided. Participants required more time for socialising. Guidelines and materials were mostly rated helpful.

Lessons LearnedSimplifying the livestreaming, presenters choice between pre-recording or presenting live, more time for socialising and breaks are discussed. Tools for conducting an online conference should be introduced to the participants in advance. Indico is rated as a very helpful tool for planning and conducting an online-conference."

This studys primary result--that most genetic diversity in humans can be accounted for by within-population differences, not between-population differences--along with Lewontins outspoken, politically-charged interpretations thereof, has become foundational to the scientific and cultural discourse pertaining to human genetic variation. The article has an unusual bibliometric trajectory in that it is much more salient in the bibliographic record today compared to the first 20 years after its publication. Here, we show how the papers fame was shaped by four factors: 1) citations in influential publications across several disciplines; 2) Lewontins own popular books and media appearances; 3) the renaissance of population genetics research of the early 1990s; and 4) the serendipitous collision of scientific progress, influential books/papers, and heated controversies in the year 1994. We conclude with an analysis of Twitter data to characterize the communities and conversations that continue to keep this study at the epicenter of discussions about race and genetics, prompting new challenges for scientists who have inherited Lewontins legacy."

C.; Maggio, L.; Murray, H.; Willinsky, J. M.",Lauren  Maggio,2021-09-24,scientific communication and education,"PurposeThere is a growing desire for health professions educators to engage learners in more meaningful instruction. Many have tapped Wikipedia to offer an applied approach to engage learners, particularly as it relates to evidence-based medicine (EBM). However, little is known about the benefits and challenges of using Wikipedia as a pedagogical tool from the collective experience of educators who have sought to improve their instructional practice with it. This study aims to uncover and synthesize the perspectives of health professions education (HPE) instructors who have incorporated Wikipedia in their HPE courses.

MethodsApplying a constructivist approach, the authors conducted semi-structured interviews with 17 participating HPE instructors who had substantively integrated Wikipedia into their curriculum. Participants were interviewed about their experiences of integrating Wikipedia editing into their courses. Thematic analysis was conducted on resulting transcripts.

ResultsAuthors observed two broad themes among participants expressed benefits of teaching with Wikipedia: 1) provides a meaningful instructional alternative that also benefits society and develops learners information literacy and EBM skills, and 2) supports learners careers and professional identity formation. Identified challenges included: 1) high effort and time, 2) issues with sourcing references, and 3) challenging interactions with skeptics, editors, and students.

DiscussionFindings build on known benefits, such as providing a real-world collaborative project that contextualizes students learning experiences. They also echo known challenges, such as the resource-intensive nature of teaching with Wikipedia. At the same time, findings extend the current literature by revealing a potential opportunity to approach crowd-sourced information tools, like Wikipedia, as a vehicle to engage and enculturate HPE students within a situated learning context. These findings present implications for HPE programs considering implementing Wikipedia and faculty development needed to help instructors harness crowd-sourced information tools pedagogical opportunities as well as anticipate their challenges."

L.; Thomas-Walters, L.; Bach, A.; Nuttall, M.; Bunnefeld, N.",Jeroen  Minderman,2021-09-26,scientific communication and education,"1O_LIModels have become indispensable tools in conservation science in the face of increasingly rapid loss of biodiversity through anthropogenic habitat loss and natural resource exploitation. In addition to their ecological components, accurately representing human decision-making processes in such models is vital to maximise their utility. This can be problematic as modelling complexity increases, making them challenging to communicate and parameterise.
C_LIO_LIGames have a long history of being used as science communication tools, but are less widely used as data collection tools, particularly in videogame form. We propose a novel approach to (1) aid communication of complex social-ecological models, and (2) ""gamesource"" human decision-making data, by explicitly casting an existing modelling framework as an interactive videogame.
C_LIO_LIWe present players with a natural resource management game as a front-end to a social-ecological modelling framework (Generalised Management Strategy Evaluation, GMSE). Players actions replace a model algorithm making management decisions about a population of wild animals, which graze on crops and can thus lower agricultural yield. A number of non-player agents (farmers) respond through modelled algorithms to the players management, taking actions that may affect their crop yield as well as the animal population. Players are asked to set their own management goal (e.g. maintain the animal population at a certain level or improve yield) and make decisions accordingly. Trial players were also asked to provide any feedback on both gameplay and purpose.
C_LIO_LIWe demonstrate the utility of this approach by collecting and analysing game play data from a sample of trial plays, in which we systematically vary two model parameters, and allowing trial players to interact with the model through the game interface. As an illustration, we show how variations in land ownership and the number of farmers in the system affects decision-making patterns as well as population trajectories (extinction probabilities).
C_LIO_LIWe discuss the potential and limitations of this model-game approach in the light of trial player feedback received. In particular, we highlight how a common concern about the game framework (perceived lack of ""realism"" or relevance to a specific context) are actually criticisms of the underlying model, as opposed to the game itself. This further highlights both the parallels between games and models, as well as the utility of model-games to aid in communicating complex models. We conclude that videogames may be an effective tool for conservation and natural resource management, and that although they provide a promising means to collect data on human decision-making, it is vital to carefully consider both external validity and potential biases when doing so.

A systematic review.,"Schulz, M.; Kopaczka, M.; Tolba, R.; Zieglowski, L.",Rene  Tolba,2021-09-28,scientific communication and education,"The Open Field test is a common tool to measure anxiety and behavioral changes in rodents. However, scientific findings of rodent experiments may not translate adequately to humans and it has been shown that larger animal models might perform better in that regard. As a result, the number of published studies involving the Open Field test in domestic pig models is increasing. The aim of our review was to investigate the Open Field set-ups in published studies as well as similarity between performance and parameters published. Following the PRISMA guidelines for reviews we selected 69 studies for data extraction in this systematic review. We were able to determine specific set-up conditions such as size, duration and daytime for most of the included studies and found a high variability within these test specifiers. Results indicate a non-uniform performance of set-up including size, timing, parameters and additional combined tests such as the novel object test. We would like to point out the need for standardization of Open Field test for pigs in order to improve result, comparability and reduce inconsistencies."

P.; Guzman Pena, K.; Escobar, D.",Juliana  Lopez-Angarita,2021-09-29,scientific communication and education,"Parrotfish (Family Scaridae) are a family of herbivorous fishes crucial to coral reef health, particularly for Caribbean reefs due to their declining coral cover. However, despite parrotfish are fully protected in some countries, they are still heavy fished in most of their Caribbean range. The consequences of this targeted fishery in the Colombian Caribbean are not fully understood due to a lack of local conservation and management resources. This research aimed to evaluate and enhance the conservation status and protection of parrotfish among local communities in the National Natural Park Corales del Rosario and San Bernardo. Underwater visual census surveys (UVC) were undertaken to evaluate reef fish community structure, and participatory education campaigns and activities were carried out with local communities to raise awareness about parrotfish ecology and their functional role in conserving Caribbean coral reef ecosystems of Colombia. UVC showed parrotfish to be dominant in the fish community, yet there was evidence of exploitation of large adults by selective fishing. Conflicts exist between the community and environmental authorities because fishing regulations are not clear, and the level of enforcement is insufficient. Parrotfish are sold to tourists, as  red snapper to fulfil high seafood demand since commercially valuable fish are now scarce. However, following intensive awareness-raising activities developed as part of this study, the community has started to recognize the vital ecological role of parrotfish in coral reef systems, and are suggesting a redrafting of fishing legislation by the environmental authorities, in order to recognise and incorporate the traditional fishing rights of human communities living within the MPA. Lobbying for the protection of parrotfish and inclusion of local communities in decision-making will take time, but this research represents the crucial first steps towards sustainable practice and cooperative alliances in the Colombian Caribbean."

Liebal,2021-09-30,scientific communication and education,"Biotechnology has experienced innovations in analytics and data processing. As the volume of data and its complexity grows, new computational procedures for extracting information are developed. However, the rate of change outpaces the adaptation of biotechnology curricula, necessitating new teaching methodologies to equip biotechnologists with data analysis abilities. To simulate experimental data, we created a virtual organism simulator (silvio) by combining diverse cellular and sub-cellular microbial models. silvio was utilized to construct a computer-based instructional workflow with important steps during strain characterization and recombinant protein expression. The instructional workflow is provided as a Jupyter Notebook with comprehensive explanatory text of biotechnological facts and experiment simulations using silvio tools. The students conduct data analysis in Python or Excel. This instructional workflow was separately implemented in two distance courses for Masters students in biology and biotechnology. The concept of using virtual organism simulations that generate coherent results across different experiments can be used to construct consistent and motivating case studies for biotechnological data literacy."

J.; Fegley, M. E.",Megan E Fegley,2021-10-01,scientific communication and education,"Two major COVID-19 pandemic challenges presented for in-person instruction included adhering to social distancing guidelines and accommodating remote learners who were temporarily isolated or permanently participating from afar. At Binghamton University, our First-year Research Immersion (FRI) program was challenged with providing students with a wet lab course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE), an intense hands-on experience that emphasized student teamwork, lab protocol development, iteration, troubleshooting and other elements of the process of science that could not be replicated in a fully remote environment. We developed an innovative technology approach to maximize all students connection to the lab research experience utilizing dedicated mobile devices (iPod Touch) and video conferencing software (Zoom) to synchronously connect remote learners to in-person learners, peer mentors and instructors in our FRI research labs. In this way, despite limited lab capacities and fluctuating remote learning populations, we were able to connect remote learners to their peers and mentors in real-time and give them responsibilities that allowed them to be engaged and feel like meaningful participants in the research process. Although our students reported a preference for in-person labs, they noted this hybrid model was better than other traditionally employed remote-learning lab options. We believe lessons learned here can be applied to improve access to research in all situations and allow us to be prepared for other catastrophic disruptions to the educational system."

S.; Padureanu, L.",Catalin S Toma,2021-10-04,scientific communication and education,"The objective of our study was to obtain an updated image of the dynamic of retractions and retraction notes, retraction reasons for questionable research and publication practices, countries producing retracted articles, and the scientific impact of retractions by studying 4844 PubMed indexed retracted articles published between 2009 and 2020 and their retraction notes.

RESULTSMistakes/inconsistent data account for 32% of total retractions, followed by images(22,5%), plagiarism(13,7%) and overlap(11,5%).

Thirty countries account for 94,79% of 4844 retractions. Top five are: China(32,78%), United States(18,84%), India(7,25%), Japan(4,37%) and Italy(3,75%).

The total citations number for all articles is 140810(Google Scholar), 96000(Dimensions).

Average exposure time(ET) is 28,89 months. Largest ET is for image retractions(49,3 months), lowest ET is for editorial errors(11,2 months).

The impact of retracted research is higher for Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom, United States, and other nine countries and lower for Pakistan, Turkey, Malaysia, and other six countries, including China.

CONCLUSIONSMistakes and data inconsistencies represent the main retraction reason; images and ethical issues show a growing trend, while plagiarism and overlap still represent a significant problem. There is a steady increase in QRP and QPP article withdrawals. Retraction of articles seems to be a technology-dependent process.

The number of citations of retracted articles shows a high impact of papers published by authors from certain countries. The number of retracted articles per country does not always accurately reflect the scientific impact of QRP/QPP articles.

The country distribution of retraction reasons shows structural problems in the organization and quality control of scientific research, which have different images depending on geographical location, economic development, and cultural model."

H.",Christian Bianchi  Strømme,2021-10-12,scientific communication and education,"Open Science (OS) comprises a variety of practices and principles that are broadly intended to improve the quality and transparency of research, and the concept is gaining traction. Since OS has multiple facets and still lacks a unifying definition, it may be interpreted quite differently among practitioners. Moreover, successfully implementing OS broadly throughout science requires a better understanding of the conditions that facilitate or hinder OS engagement, and in particular, how practitioners learn OS in the first place. We addressed these issues by surveying OS practitioners that attended a workshop hosted by the Living Norway Ecological Data Network in 2020. The survey contained scaled-response and open-ended questions, allowing for a mixed-methods approach. Out of 128 registered participants we obtained survey responses from 60 individuals. Responses indicated usage and sharing of data and code, as well as open access publications, as the OS aspects most frequently engaged with. Men and those affiliated with academic institutions reported more frequent engagement with OS than women and those with other affiliations. When it came to learning OS practices, only a minority of respondents reported having encountered OS in their own formal education. Consistent with this, a majority of respondents viewed OS as less important in their teaching than in their research and supervision. Even so, many of the respondents suggestions for what would help or hinder individual OS engagement included more knowledge, guidelines, resource availability and social and structural support; indicating that formal instruction can facilitate individual OS engagement. We suggest that the time is ripe to incorporate OS in teaching and learning, as this can yield substantial benefits to OS practitioners, student learning, and ultimately, the objectives advanced by the OS movement."

The impact and feasibility of the intervention was evaluated in a prospective randomised controlled feasibility trial.

ResultsA total of 49 parent-daughter dyads completed baseline knowledge assessment (n=24 control, n=25 intervention), and 35 dyads completed knowledge assessment at week 2 (n=17 control, n=18 intervention). The intervention was associated with a statistically significant increase in HPV, and HPV vaccine knowledge and intention to vaccinate. All intervention participants found the video interesting, while 96% found it useful.

ConclusionsThis intervention was found to be affordable, practicable, effective (cost-effective), acceptable, safe, and equitable, in this feasibility study."

M.; Kaya, D.; Grogan, K. E.",Kathleen E Grogan,2021-10-18,scientific communication and education,"In order to successfully obtain a faculty position, postdoctoral fellows or  postdocs, must submit an application which requires considerable time and effort to produce. These job applications are often reviewed by mentors and colleagues, but rarely are postdocs offered the opportunity to solicit feedback multiple times from reviewers with the same breadth of expertise often found on an academic search committee. To address this gap, this manuscript describes an international peer reviewing program for small groups of postdocs with a broad range of expertise to reciprocally and iteratively provide feedback to each other on their application materials. Over 145 postdocs have participated, often multiple times, over three years. A survey of participants in this program revealed that nearly all participants would recommend participation in such a program to other faculty applicants. Furthermore, this program was more likely to attract participants who struggled to find mentoring and support elsewhere, either because they changed fields or because of their identity as a woman or member of an underrepresented population in STEM. Participation in programs like this one could provide early career academics like postdocs with a diverse and supportive community of peer mentors during the difficult search for a faculty position. Such psychosocial support and encouragement has been shown to prevent attrition of individuals from these populations and programs like this one target the largest  leak in the pipeline, that of postdoc to faculty. Implementation of similar peer reviewing programs by universities or professional scientific societies could provide a valuable mechanism of support and increased chances of success for early-career academics in their search for independence."

A key objective of the CRE-PF was establishment of a unique national training scheme, CREATE, for early-career researchers (ECRs) in respiratory research. CREATE ECRs are broadly drawn from two main fields of researchers: clinicians and scientists, where clinicians tend to be involved in part-time translational research and scientists are involved in broad scientific research including laboratory or genetic research, health economics or population research.

MethodsWe describe the CREATE Program which, with limited budget and the assistance of key organisations, has provided funding opportunities (scholarships, fellowships, prizes, travel and collaboration grants), professional development (mentoring program, symposia, presentation opportunities and on-line training) and fostered a connected, supportive research community for respiratory ECRs.

ResultsThe CREATE program has successfully fostered the development of the supported researchers, contributing substantially to the future of pulmonary fibrosis research in Australia. During the life of the program the CRE-PF has offered 10 PhD scholarships and five postdoctoral fellowships, awarded 13 travel grants and three grants to promote collaboration between ECRs from different institutes. A mentoring program has been established and CREATE Symposia have been held in association with key meetings. During COVID-19 restrictions, a series of virtual research meetings has offered 12 CREATE ECRs from seven universities the opportunity to present their research to a national audience.

CREATE research-related achievements are impressive, including over 80 first-author publications by ECRs, and many conference presentations. Contributions to the research community, measured by committee membership, is also strong.

ConclusionsIn spite of a very limited budget, wide geographic distribution of participants and the multi-disciplinary nature of the cohort, we have succeeded in providing a unique, supportive academic development environment for CREATE ECRs. Lessons learned in the process of developing this program include the importance of leveraging funding, being flexible, building networks and seeking and responding to ECR input."

Post-treatment of such an effluent prior to its applicability in irrigation can be of significant importance. In this study, the wastewater from a natural treatment plant was treated using a lab-scale filtration system with zeolite as a filter material. Three different column depths (0.5 m, 0.75 m, and 1 m) were used to investigate the effect of column depth on the treatment efficiency of the media. The suitability of the raw wastewater and the treated effluent from each column for irrigation purposes was investigated. The water quality parameters investigated were; electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), sodium (Na+), calcium (Ca2+), and magnesium (Mg2+). From the analysis results, it was observed that the column depth had a significant influence on the removal efficiency of the pollutants. Where the removal efficiency was observed to be increasing with the increase in the column depth. The highest removal efficiency (94.58%) was achieved from the combination of electrical conductivity and 1 m column depth, while the lowest removal efficiency (10.05%) was observed from the combination of calcium and 0.5 m column depth. The raw wastewater fell mostly into a ""very high"" hazard, which is class four (C4) based on electrical conductivity and class four (S4) based sodium adsorption ratio; making it unsuitable for irrigation purposes. However, the status improved after the treatment using different column depths."

An equal number of professors recruited at other Italian universities and of researchers who never attained professorship in Italy were randomly chosen in the same disciplines as each Florentine professor among individuals possessing National Scientific Qualification, a prerequisite for professorship. The H-indexes at the time of qualification (T1), of the Florence call (T2), and the current (T3) time were obtained from Scopus.

Non-recruited researchers were more likely (Chi-square test) to show a higher H-index than both Florentine (T1 p=0.0005, T2 p=0.0015, T3 p=0.0095) and non-Florentine professors (T1 p=0.0078, T2 p=0.0245, T3 p=0.0500). Fifty-four non-recruited scientists serve in foreign universities, 100 at national/international research centers. The remaining 32 scientists (25 who keep producing despite precarious employment, and seven who have stopped publishing) were, at any rate, as likely as Florentine (T3 p=0.69) and non-Florentine professors (T3 p=0.14) to show a higher H-index.

This study suggests that Italian academia does not recruit professors according to their qualitative/quantitative ability to publish, a detriment to knowledge for the nationwide system and on a global scale."

While it is well-established that microbes, such as bacteria and fungi most often exist in multicellular biofilm communities, descriptions in standard biology textbooks continue to focus on the single-celled form of microbial life. We have developed an analogy-based instructional tool to introduce and explain biofilms to high school and undergraduate students. The module employs an analogy with beehives, given that biofilms and beehives are both  superorganism states, to explain key biofilm features such as development and structure, chemical communication, division of labor and emergent properties. We delivered this analogy based learning tool to a cohort of 49 high school and undergraduate students, and based on participant feedback and learnings, present a formal evaluation of the instructional tool. Further, we outline prerequisites and learning approaches that can enable the delivery of this module in classroom and virtual learning settings, including suggestions for pre-lesson reading, student-centred interactive activities, and specific learning objectives. Taken together, this instructional analogy holds potential to serve as an educational tool to introduce biofilms in high school and undergraduate curricula in a relatable and comprehensible manner."

It is increasingly critical to nurture a lifelong concern for forest health both locally and globally. Here, in two experiments, we demonstrate that school age children (6-18 yrs. old; N>1000;) of three nationalities (China, D. R. Congo and U.S.) do not have levels of intrinsic motivation to allow for successful cooperation in common-pool goods games requiring them to maintain a forest. We instead find that the size, timing, and certainty of receiving individual payoffs from cooperation significantly boost the odds of successful conservation efforts. We also provide evidence that the experience of playing this game increases longer term motivation to conserve forests. Results have implications for designing policy and curriculum to encourage collective action for forest conservation.

However, a disconnect exists between the stated goals for science outreach and its actual impact. In order to examine one potential source of this disconnect, we undertook a survey-based study to explore whether barriers to participation (either intrinsic or extrinsic) in science outreach exist within the academic community. We received responses to our survey from 530 individuals, the vast majority of whom engage in some type of science outreach activity on an annual basis. Those who engage in outreach report doing so for both personal and altruistic reasons, and having high (yet varied) levels of comfort with performing outreach activities. Respondents also report the existence of several significant yet surmountable barriers to participation, including lack of time and funding. Our findings demonstrate that both levels of participation in, and attitudes toward, science outreach within the academic community are generally favorable, suggesting that the general ineffectiveness of science outreach is due to other causes. We place our findings within the context of the broader science outreach, science communication and public engagement literature. We make recommendations on how existing approaches and infrastructure can, and must, be changed in order to improve the practice."

One of the most important related factors is the idea of making research output freely available: the so-called Open Access (OA) option. OA is considered very important in spreading of knowledge, breaking down barriers in benefit of research, and increasing the impact of research outputs within the scientific community.

Here, we carried out a comparison between Non-Open Access (NOA) and OA medical Journals in terms of growing rate, geographical distribution, and the impact on scientific community.

We collected the bibliometric data on the scientific Journals indexed in Scopus starting from 2001 to 2016 published either as NOA or OA. Then, we analysed the number of Journals, their geolocalization, their impact on the scientific community, and the parameters as SJR, H index, and cites for document (2 years).

As a result, we found that while the number of NOA Journals is virtually stable, that of OA is dramatically increasing, with a growing rate higher than 400% in 2016. Then, the majority of OA Journals are published in developing Countries (Brazil, India, South Africa, South Korea, New Zealand, Serbia, and Poland) and their impact within researchers is lower compared to the NOA Journals.

In conclusion, our data provide an updated and unprecedented picture of OA adoption in medical field, with its lights and shadows.

Article HighlightsO_LIWe are seeing in medicine a huge increase in the number of Journals that use OA;
C_LIO_LIThis trend is mainly due to the increase in publishing Journals in Countries with emergent economies;
C_LIO_LIThe use of OA for Journals in the medical field, did not guarantee a vantage in term of bibliometric parameters.

R.",Tal  Seidel Malkinson,2021-11-10,scientific communication and education,"Editorial decision-making is a fundamental element of the scientific enterprise. We examined whether contributions to editorial decisions at various stages of the publication process is subject to gender disparity, based on analytics collected by the biomedical researcher-led journal eLife. Despite efforts to increase women representation, the board of reviewing editors (BRE) was men-dominant (69%). Moreover, authors suggested more men from the BRE pool, even after correcting for mens numerical over-representation. Although women editors were proportionally involved in the initial editorial process, they were under-engaged in editorial activities involving reviewers and authors. Additionally, converging evidence showed gender homophily in manuscripts assignment, such that men Senior Editors over-engaged men Reviewing Editors. This tendency was stronger in more gender-balanced scientific disciplines. Together, our findings confirm that gender disparities exist along the editorial process and suggest that merely increasing the proportion of women might not be sufficient to eliminate this bias."

M.; Albers, C. J.; Schilthuizen, M.; Smeets, I.",Michiel J. D. Hooykaas,2021-11-11,scientific communication and education,"While biodiversity decline continues and laypeoples knowledge about species is limited, especially in children, high-quality communication is needed to raise awareness. For this, communicators should be aware of current knowledge levels in their target groups. We compared biodiversity communicators' estimates of the average species literacy level in primary school children with the actual level. Moreover, we explored the importance that communicators placed on species literacy and the level that they desired. Estimations of childrens average knowledge level varied widely and differed from the actual level. In particular, communicators overestimated the species literacy level. Although most biodiversity communicators agreed that knowledge about species is important, their view differed as to why species literacy would be important. Moreover, communicators differed with respect to the relative importance attached to different knowledge components. Professionals may thus benefit from a detailed framework of species literacy that illustrates different aspects and values. Most importantly, our findings suggest that to bridge the gap between actual and desired knowledge levels in children effectively, biodiversity communicators first need to become more aware of current perceptions in young audiences."

B.",Nancy B Schwartz,2021-11-21,scientific communication and education,"In the interest of advocating for the postdoctoral community in the United States, we present results from survey data collected before and during the COVID-19 pandemic on the same population of postdocs. In 2019, 5,929 postdocs in the US completed a comprehensive survey, and in 2020, a subset completed a follow-up survey several months into the pandemic. The results show that the pandemic has substantially impacted postdocs mental health and wellness irrespective of gender, race, citizenship, or other identities. Postdocs also reported a significant impact on their career trajectories and progression, reduced confidence in achieving career goals, and negative perceptions of the job market compared to pre-COVID-19. International postdocs also reported experiencing distinct stressors due to the changes in immigration policy. Notably, having access to Postdoctoral Associations and Postdoctoral Offices positively impacted postdocs overall well-being and helped mitigate the personal and professional stresses and career uncertainties caused by the pandemic.

Animal cognition/behavior research has multiple benefits; it provides fundamental knowledge on animal biology and evolution but can also have applied conservation and welfare applications. Zoos provide an excellent yet relatively untapped resource for animal cognition research, because they house a wide variety of species - many of which are under threat - and allow close observation and relatively high experimental control compared to the wild. Multi-zoo collaboration leads to increased sample size and species representation, which in turn leads to more robust science. However, there are salient challenges associated with zoo-based cognitive research, which are subject-based (e.g., small sample sizes at single zoos, untrained/unhabituated subjects, site effects) and human-based (e.g., time restrictions, safety concerns, and perceptions of animals interacting with unnatural technology or apparatus). We aim to increase the understanding and subsequent uptake of animal cognition research in zoos, by transparently outlining the main benefits and challenges. Importantly, we use our own research (1) a study on novelty responses in hornbills, and (2) a multi-site collaboration called the  ManyBirds project to demonstrate how challenges may be overcome. These potential options include using  drop and go apparatuses that require no training, close human contact or animal separation. This article is aimed at zoo animal care and research staff, as well as external researchers interested in zoo-based studies.

Rather we need to ask: Why do so many international students come to US universities for science, what are we doing right in science, and how do we stay ahead in science education? Poor scores on international assessments belie the fact that the U.S. has the best science education system in the world. Our study of 6,200 high school teachers in 1998 and 2018 documented striking success in retooling classrooms for labbased instruction in biotechnology and provided a pre-COVID-19 snapshot of what is right with American biology education. However, it also highlights the need revitalize our precollege teaching resource with a renewed National Science Foundation commitment to in-service training."

A.; Stirner, M.; Schmahl, C.; Sicorello, M.",Christian  Paret,2021-11-30,scientific communication and education,"Replicability and reproducibility of scientific findings is paramount for sustainable progress in neuroscience. Preregistration of the hypotheses and methods of an empirical study before analysis, the sharing of primary research data, and compliance with data standards such as the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS), are considered effective practices to secure progress and to substantiate quality of research. We investigated the current level of adoption of open science practices in neuroimaging and the difficulties that prevent researchers from using them.

Email invitations to participate in the survey were sent to addresses received through a PubMed search of human functional magnetic resonance imaging studies between 2010 and 2020. 283 persons completed the questionnaire.

Although half of the participants were experienced with preregistration, the willingness to preregister studies in the future was modest. The majority of participants had experience with the sharing of primary neuroimaging data. Most of the participants were interested in implementing a standardized data structure such as BIDS in their labs. Based on demographic variables, we compared participants on seven subscales, which had been generated through factor analysis. It was found that experienced researchers at lower career level had higher fear of being transparent, researchers with residence in the EU had a higher need for data governance, and researchers at medical faculties as compared to other university faculties reported a higher need for data governance and a more unsupportive environment.

The results suggest growing adoption of open science practices but also highlight a number of important impediments."

S.; Wilks, J.; Jacque, B.",EmilyKate  McDonough,2021-12-01,scientific communication and education,"To broaden participation in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM), we must understand the factors that shape perspectives and beliefs around career selection. Good measurement of these factors is crucial to quantify how effectively educational interventions impact student attitudes towards STEM. Adolescents are particularly suited for quantifying intervention efficacy because students build their identities during these formative years and make important career choices. To better quantify intervention efficacy at the high school level, we developed an instrument entitled Student Attitudes Surrounding STEM (SASS), which builds upon the social cognitive career theory (SCCT) framework for understanding career selection. Questionnaire responses were collected from 932 high school students and split into samples of 400 for exploratory factor analysis and 532 for confirmatory factor analysis. The 37 questions clustered into six factors: Self-Efficacy-Experience, Self-Efficacy-Academic, Outcome Expectations, Interests, Negative Perceptions of Scientists, and Career Awareness. Adequate construct validity for the factors indicated in the SASS model was suggested by the fit indices and theoretical considerations. Furthermore, the analyses supported criterion validity, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability. This tool represents a novel integration of three latent variables into SCCT: Negative Perceptions of Scientists, Career Awareness, and an experience factor for Self-Efficacy."

However, students from underrepresented groups (UR) are less likely to be mentored or have access to mentors, particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. We developed and implemented a workshop, to provide the necessary foundation for students to be better prepared for establishing future mentorships throughout graduate and professional school.

MethodsFaculty well-versed in the area of effective mentorship from multiple universities developed and delivered a 1.5-hour workshop to address the roles of a mentor, especially when it comes to UR students, and how students may effectively work with multiple mentors. This workshop was delivered to a group of students from the HBCU Winston Salem State University, and a pre/post-Likert scale-based survey was administered.

ResultsWe analyzed the raw data with nonparametric tests for comparison within paired samples. Wilcoxon matched-pairs and signed-rank tests showed statistically significant growth in student self-ratings related to the workshop learning objectives.

ConclusionsThe ""How to Handle More than One Mentor to Achieve Excellence"" workshop was well received as a component of pre-graduate and pre-professional training. Incorporating workshops like this may increase student preparedness around developing and cultivating healthy mentorship relationships throughout STEM training.

V.; Strickland, C.; Talmy, D.; von Arnim, A. G.; Wiggins, G.",Louis J Gross,2021-12-05,scientific communication and education,"Substantial guidance is available on undergraduate quantitative training for biologists, including reports focused on biomedical science, but far less attention has been paid to the graduate curriculum. In this setting, we propose an innovative approach to quantitative education that goes beyond recommendations of a course or set of courses or activities. Due to the diversity of quantitative methods, it is infeasible to expect that biomedical PhD students can be exposed to more than a minority of the quantitative concepts and techniques employed in modern biology. We developed a novel prioritization approach in which we mined and analyzed quantitative concepts and skills from publications that faculty in relevant units deemed central to the scientific comprehension of their field. The analysis provides a prioritization of quantitative skills and concepts and could represent an effective method to drive curricular focus based upon program-specific faculty input for biological science programs of all types. Our results highlight the disconnect between typical undergraduate quantitative education for life science students, focused on continuous mathematics, and the concepts and skills in graphics, statistics, and discrete mathematics that arise from priorities established by biomedical science faculty.

One Sentence SummaryWe developed a novel approach to prioritize quantitative concepts and methods for inclusion in a graduate biomedical science curriculum based upon approaches included in faculty-identified key publications."
10.1101/2021.12.03.471055,Characteristics and data reporting of rare disease clinical trials: Getting better but still room for improvement,"Mair, N. K.; Gottowik, J.; Rodriguez-Esteban, R.; Seabrook, T. J.",Nina K Mair,2021-12-07,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundIt is estimated that there are more than 7,000 rare diseases (RDs) worldwide, impacting the lives of approximately 400 million people and only 5% have an approved therapy. Facing special challenges, including patient scarceness, incomplete knowledge of the natural history and only few specialized clinical sites, clinical trials (CT) are limited, making the data from trials critical for research and clinical care. Despite the introduction of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Amendment Act (FDAAA) in 2007 requiring certain CTs to post results on the registry ClinicalTrials.gov within 12 months following completion, compliance has been reportedly poor. Here, we describe general characteristics of RD CTs, identify trends, and evaluate result reporting practices under the FDAAA aiming to draw awareness to the problem of non-compliance.

MethodsCTs conducted between 2008 and 2015 were extracted from the public U.S. trial registry ClinicalTrials.gov using the text mining software I2E (Linguamatics). Disease names were matched with rare disease names from the Orphanet Rare Disease Ontology (ORDO, v2.5, Orphanet). Statistical analyses and data visualization were performed using GraphPad Prism 7 and R (v3.5). The Students t-test was employed to calculate significance using p-value cut-offs of <0.05 or <0.001.

ResultsWe analyzed 1,056 RD CTs of which 55.7% were phase 2, 7.7% phase 2/3 and 36.7% phase 3 trials. The studies were mostly one- and two-armed experimental CTs with the majority (60.2%) being funded by industry. Cystic fibrosis and sickle cell disease represented the most frequently investigated diseases (25.0% and 16.5%). Industry-led phase 2 RD CTs were significantly (p<0.0001) shorter than their equivalent led by academia/non-profit (22 vs. 33 months). Screening CTs completed before the end of 2015, we found that of the 725 analyzed studies, 55.2% predominantly phase 2 CTs, did not report results. Taking their potential applicability to the FDAAA into account, 25.2% industry-funded and 28.0% academia/non-profit-funded trials failed to disclose results on ClinicalTrial.gov.

ConclusionRD CTs tend to be comparatively small, industry-funded studies focusing on genetic and neurologic conditions. Sponsor-related differences in study design, duration, and enrollment were observed. There are still substantial shortcomings when it comes to result publication."

SEF participation showed significant ethnic diversity. For survey students, the approximate distribution was Asian-32%; Black-11%; Hispanic-20%; White-33%; Other-3%. Comparing the SEF level at which students competed from school to district to region to state levels, we observed that black students made up only 4.5% of the students who participated in SEF beyond the school level, whereas students from other ethnic groups were more equally represented at all levels. The lower percentage of Black students resulted from a combination of lower overall participation in SEF and lower percentage of those students who did participate to advance to SEFs beyond the school level. Students who advanced to SEFs beyond the school level frequently received help from scientists, coaching for the interview, and were not required to participate in SEF. Black students received the least help from scientists, were least likely to receive coaching for the interview, and were most likely to be required to participate in SEF. They also were most likely to receive no help from parents, teachers, or scientists. Asian and Hispanic students (63.8% and 56.8%) indicated a greater interest in careers in science and engineering (S&E) compared to Black and White students (43.7% & 50.7%). In addition to career interest, the most important experiences that correlated with students who indicated that SEF increased their interests in S&E were getting help from the internet, books and magazines; getting help fine tuning the report; and overcoming obstacles by doing more background research, making a timeline, and perseverance. Black students did not report a positive effect of any of these strategies but experienced time pressure as more of an obstacle than did other students. Our findings identify a wide range of student experiences associated with positive SEF outcomes that could be enhanced for all students but especially Black students. More involvement of scientists in helping students who participate in SEFs would be particularly valuable."

In response, we launched the Diversity and Science Lecture series, a cross-institutional platform where junior life scientists present their research and comment on equity, diversity, and inclusion in STEM. We characterize speaker representation from 79 profiles and investigate topic noteworthiness via quantitative content analysis of talk transcripts. Nearly every speaker discussed interpersonal support, and three-fifths of speakers commented on race or ethnicity. Other topics, such as sexual and gender minority identity, were less frequently addressed but highly salient to the speakers who mentioned them. We found that significantly co-occurring topics reflected not only conceptual similarity, such as terms for racial identities, but also intersectional significance, such as identifying as a Latina/Hispanic woman or Asian immigrant, and interactions between priorities and identities, including the heightened value of friendship to the LGBTQ community, which we reproduce using transcripts from an independent seminar series. Our approach to scholar profiles and talk transcripts serves as an example for transmuting hundreds of hours of scholarly discourse into rich datasets that can power computational audits of speaker diversity and illuminate speakers personal and professional priorities."

This paper provides an overview of the course structure, showing how the constituent elements have been designed and refined over successive iterations of the course. We detail how FSFE students: 1. Work closely with discipline specialists to develop a small group project that tests an hypothesis to answer a genuine scientific question in the field; 2. Learn critical skills of data management and communication; and 3. Analyse, interpret and present their results in the format of a scientific symposium. This process is repeated in an iterative  cognitive apprenticeship model, supported by a series of workshops that name and explicitly instruct the students in  hard and  soft skills critical relevant for research and other careers. FSFE students develop a coherent and nuanced understanding of how to approach and execute ecological studies. The sophisticated knowledge and ecological research skills that they develop during the course is demonstrated through high quality presentations and peer-reviewed publications in an open-access, student-led journal. We outline our course structure and evaluate its efficacy to show how this novel combination of field course elements allows students to gain maximum value from their educational journey, and to develop cognitive, affective and reflective tools to help apply their skills as scientists."

Mentoring shapes every trainee and their career path in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Productive mentoring relationships cultivate rapport, stimulate moments of introspection, and provide constructive feedback. Effective mentoring in STEM allows trainees, especially underrepresented minorities (URMs), to flourish in welcoming and supportive environments. However, URM trainees often experience inadequate mentoring due to their mentors inexperience with URM groups, poor mentorship training, or a lack of understanding of their mentees journey. To promote diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM education and research, it is essential for mentors and mentees to work together with creativity, authenticity, and networking. In this workshop, we will focus on mentees perspective on how mentors can enhance their training, professional and career development, and improve their focus. We analyzed data on feedback obtained from students interested in pursuing graduate education who attended a recent workshop. Our results show that despite low initial expectations for the workshop, many students were satisfied with the knowledge they learned. The future of increasing the URM representation in STEM lies in providing adequate community support and mentorship throughout the careers of URM professionals."

MethodsIn Survey 1, we asked each lab member to identify and rank up to 10 values that are important for a healthy lab environment. They were then asked to rate how well the lab embodied those values at two time points: before the COVID-19 pandemic while working onsite, and at the time of the survey while working remotely (10 months into the pandemic). In a series of live group sessions, we reviewed relevant literature and the survey results to finalize ten themes. We then reflected on each theme and proposed action items to address any deficiencies. Finally, we conducted Survey 2 after the self-assessment to judge the groups finalized themes, implemented changes, and overall satisfaction with the assessment process.

ResultsThemes identified were attitude, accountability, teamwork/collaboration, communication, diversity/inclusion, emotional intelligence, integrity, training, well-being, and adaptability in crisis-management. All lab members liked the self-assessment process and felt their voices were heard. On average, there was a 12% increase in satisfaction across all themes from the start to end of the lab assessment.

ConclusionWe successfully assessed the culture of our lab and subsequently improved lab member satisfaction. The success of this team project suggests that other scientific labs could benefit from similar interactive self-assessments."

J.; Dangremond Stanton, J.",Julie  Dangremond Stanton,2021-12-10,scientific communication and education,"STEM instructors are encouraged to adopt active learning in their courses, yet our understanding of how active learning affects different groups of students is still developing. One group often overlooked in higher education research is students with disabilities. Two of the most commonly occurring disabilities on college campuses are attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and specific learning disorders (SLD). We investigated how the incorporation of active-learning practices influences the learning and self-advocacy experiences of students with ADHD and/or SLD (ADHD/SLD) in undergraduate STEM courses. Semi-structured interviews with 25 STEM majors with ADHD/SLD were conducted and data were analyzed using qualitative methods. Most participants perceived themselves to learn best in a STEM course with at least some elements of active learning. Participants described how they perceived active learning to support or hinder their learning and how active learning affected their self-advocacy. Active-learning barriers could be attributed to a combination of instructional factors. These factors included how a particular active-learning practice was implemented within a STEM course and limited awareness of universal design for learning. Defining the supports and barriers perceived by students with ADHD/SLD is a crucial first step in developing more inclusive active-learning STEM courses.

The SMBT has been used to assess upper-body power in various populations and to establish concurrent validity for other measures of upper-body power such as the bench press power test and the plyometric push-up. The SMBT is less costly and simpler to incorporate into a field test battery than other upper body power assessments. While the SMBT is a valid, reliable field test for upper-body power, normative reference standards for most populations, including adolescent (12-15 years old) physical education students, do not exist.

PurposeThis study reports distances thrown in the SMBT to establish normative reference values in male and female physical education students, ages 12-15 years old.

MethodsOne hundred thirteen untrained male and female physical education students aged 12-15 years performed the SMBT field test three times on a single testing day. Participants threw a 2kg medicine ball with a 19.5 cm diameter while seated at a 90{degrees} after recording height, body mass, and BMI.

ResultsParticipant data was separated by age gender for analysis. Mean and standard deviation for the SMBT for males was 4.3{+/-}0.7m and 5.2{+/-}0.8 m for ages 12-13 and 14-15, respectively, and for females was 3.4{+/-}0.5m and 3.7{+/-}0.5m for ages 12-13 and 14-15, respectively. Pearson correlation coefficients for between-trials comparisons for males and females ranged from r=0.85-0.97. Pearson correlation coefficients for average SMBT and age of participants was r=0.93. Normative reference values as percentile ranks for the SMBT scores for age groups 12-13 and 14-15 among males and females, respectively, were also established.

ConclusionThe data presented provides an initial set of normative reference standards for coaches and students to determine upper-body muscular power using the SMBT."

By performing BERT model and text classification with XLNET with which uses to classify text and purpose of the texts (i.e.) tweets. So that I can get a deep understanding of the texts. When developing the system, I used two models the XLNet and DistilBERT for the text sorting task, but the outcome was XLNET out-performs the given approach to the best accuracy achieved. Now I discover a whole lot vital for as it should be categorizing tweets as encompassing self-said COVID-19 indications. Whether or not a tweets associated with COVID-19 is a non-public report or an information point out to the virus. Which gives test accuracy to an F1 score of 96%."

Pasricha,2021-12-24,scientific communication and education,"In the present study, three basic aspects related to COVID-19 are presented.

O_LIThe occurrence of coronavirus infection is analyzed statistically as number of coronaviruses infected alveolar cells compared to normal alveolar cells in human lungs. The mole concept is used to estimate the number of normal alveolar cells per human lung. The number of coronavirus infections in infected alveolar cells is estimated from the published Lower Respiratory Tract (LRT) load data. The Poisson probability distribution is aptly applied to imply the incubation period of the coronavirus infection to be within day-3 to day-7, with the cumulative probability of 75%. The incubation period within day-0 to day-10 has a cumulative probability of 98%. It implies a 10-day quarantine to isolate an uninfected individual as a precautionary measure.
C_LIO_LIThree vaccines to combat COVID-19, which adopt distinct paradigms while preparing them, are analyzed. These are Modernas mRNA-1273, Oxford-AstraZenecas ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and Bharat BioTechs COVAXIN. The mole concept is used to estimate the antigen mass density per dose of each of these vaccines as 10 g cm-3, 0.1 g cm-3 and 1 g cm-3, respectively. The vaccines are deemed to be compatible to neutralize the infection.
C_LIO_LIA statistical analysis is performed of the Modernas mRNA-1273 vaccine efficacy of 94.1% and Oxfords ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine efficacy of 62.1% in terms of groups of volunteers testing negative to vaccine by chance. In the Moderna vaccination testing scenario, since the probability of negative response of vaccine is small, the Poisson probability distribution for 95% cumulative probability is used to describe the vaccination testing in 300 samples of 47 volunteers each. Thus, 87% of samples have average group of 3 volunteers testing negative to vaccine. About 6% of samples have all volunteers testing positive to vaccine. In the Oxford vaccination testing scenario, since the probability of negative response of vaccine is finite, the Gaussian probability distribution for 95% probability is used to describe the vaccination testing in 75 samples of 120 volunteers each. Thus, 68% of samples have average group of 45 volunteers testing negative to vaccine. No sample has all volunteers testing positive to vaccine. A vaccine, irrespective of its efficacy being high or low, is necessary for mass immunization.

A.; Saborido, C. M.",Helena  Mouriño,2022-01-04,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundQuadrivalent Inactivated Vaccine (QIV) is expected to replace Trivalent Inactivated Vaccine (TIV) over time. In Portugal, TIV is free of charge for risk groups, which include older adults. In its turn, QIV - which provides broader protection as it includes an additional lineage B strain - was introduced in Portugal in October 2018, but only from the influenza season 2019/20 was provided free of charge for the risk groups. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of switching from TIV to QIV from the National Health Service perspective in the Portuguese elderly mainland population ([&ge;] 65 years old).

MethodsA decision tree model was developed to compare TIV and QIV, based on Portuguese hospitalization data for the 2015/16 influenza season. The primary health economic outcome under consideration was the Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER). In addition, a one-Way Sensitivity Analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of model parameters on the ICER; Probabilistic Sensitivity Analysis was also carried out to analyze the robustness of the base case results.

ResultsThe high cost of QIV (approximately three times the cost of TIV) would lead to a total increment of 5,283,047 {euro}, and the resulting ICER would be 26,403,007{euro}/QALY, mainly above the usual willingness-to-pay threshold.

ConclusionsFrom the National Health Service perspective, our findings reveal that QIV is not cost-effective for the Portuguese elderly population due to the high cost. If the QIV costs were the same as the TIV, then QIV would be cost-effective."

In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic prompted institutions hosting summer URE programs to offer them remotely, raising questions about whether undergraduates who participate in remote research can experience scientific integration. To address this, we investigated indicators of scientific integration for students who participated in remote life science URE programs in summer 2020. We found that these students experienced gains in their scientific self-efficacy and scientific identity similar to results reported for in-person UREs. We also found that these students perceived high benefits and low costs of doing research at the outset of their programs, and their perceptions did not change despite the remote circumstances. Yet, their perceptions differed by program, indicating that programs differentially affected students perceptions of the costs of doing research. Finally, we observed that students with prior research experience made greater gains in self-efficacy and identity, as well as in their perceptions of the alignment of their values with those of the scientific community, in comparison to students with no prior research experience. This finding suggests that additional programming may be needed for undergraduates with no prior experience to benefit from remote research."

P.",Juan Pablo Alperin,2022-01-05,scientific communication and education,"Review, promotion, and tenure (RPT) processes at universities typically assess candidates along three dimensions: research, teaching, and service. In recent years, some have argued for the inclusion of a controversial fourth criterion: collegiality. While collegiality plays a role in the morale and effectiveness of academic departments, it is amorphic and difficult to assess, and could be misused to stifle dissent or enforce homogeneity. Despite this, some institutions have opted to include this additional element in their RPT documents and processes, but it is unknown the extent of this practice and how it varies across institution type and disciplinary units. This study is based on two sets of data: survey data collected as part of a project that explored the publishing decisions of faculty and how these related to perceived importance in RPT processes, and 864 RPT documents collected from 129 universities from the United States and Canada. We analysed these RPT documents to determine the degree to which collegiality and related terms are mentioned, if they are defined, and if and how they may be assessed during the RPT process. Results show that when collegiality and related terms appear in these documents they are most often just briefly mentioned. It is less common for collegiality and related terms to be defined or assessed in RPT documents. Although the terms are mentioned across all types of institutions, there is a statistically significant difference in how prevalent they are at each. Collegiality is more commonly mentioned in the documents of doctoral research-focused universities (60%), than of masters universities and colleges (31%) or baccalaureate colleges (15%). Results from the accompanying survey of faculty also support this finding: individuals from R-Types were more likely to perceive collegiality to be a factor in their RPT processes. We conclude that collegiality likely plays an important role in RPT processes, whether it is explicitly acknowledged in policies and guidelines or not, and point to several strategies in how it might be best incorporated in the assessment of academic careers."

P.",Deepti  Ramadoss,2022-01-07,scientific communication and education,"In July 2020, four months into the disruption of normal life caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, we assessed the institutional climate within the School of Medicine. Voluntary surveys were completed by 135 graduate students in 11 PhD-granting programs and by 83 members of the graduate training faculty. Several themes emerged. PhD students work hard, but the number of hours spent on research-related activities has declined during the pandemic. The students are worried about the pandemics impact on their research productivity, consequent delays in their graduation, and diminished future job prospects. Many late stage PhD students feel they do not have adequate time or resources to plan for their future careers. Symptoms of anxiety and/or depression are prevalent in 51% of the students, based on answers to standardized questions. Most students report they have strong mentoring relationships with their faculty advisors and like their programs, but they identify to a lesser extent with the medical school as a whole. Faculty think highly of their graduate students and are also worried about the pandemics impact upon productivity and the welfare of students. Students are interested in access to an Ombuds office, which is currently being organized by the medical school. Moving forward, the school needs to address issues of bias, faculty diversity, support for mentor training, professional development, and the imposter syndrome. We must also work to create a climate in which many more graduate students feel that they are valued members of the academic medicine community."

Results of the present study indicate that increasing growth trend in the annual number of publications. A significant correlation (p<0.05) between the number of articles and per capita GDP (Gross Domestic Production) was also observed. Senior authors dominated in terms of the article count, citation count, h index, and other author productivity indices. Journal of the National Science Foundation of Sri Lanka had the highest article count (n=33). Aquatic studies in Sri Lanka were more locally funded. Sri Lanka had strong research collaborations with Japan, South Korea and Australia. During 2000-2019, the transition of aquatic studies from lacustrine field studies to molecular lab-based studies were observed. The findings of the present study may provide a comprehensive understanding on the current context and future directions of aquatic studies in Sri Lanka."

O.",Morufu Olalekan Raimi,2022-01-14,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundHistorically, ships have played an important role in transmitting infectious diseases around the world. The spread of cholera pandemics in the 19th century was thought to be linked to trade routes and facilitated by merchant shipping. The international maritime traffic of people and goods has often contributed to the spread of pathogens affecting public health.

ObjectivesTo assess level of awareness and knowledge of international Health regulation (IHR 2005) content among port health officer

MethodsThe study design was descriptive cross-sectional evaluation, questionnaires were used to capture the respondents knowledge, awareness and sanitary condition of ship in accordance with (IHR 2005)

ResultsOn awareness and knowledge, Majority of the respondent (77.1 %) demonstrate good awareness of the IHR (2005), while 22.9% had not and some even testified of hearing the said document for the first time. Despite the fact that majority of respondent were aware but only 24.6% of them can actually demonstrate good knowledge of IHR (2005) and its intent to protect and prevent spread of disease along the international route.

ConclusionThere is need to improve the knowledge of port health officers by expand training and guidance on application of the IHRs to frontline officer at point of entries. Also ensure more thorough inspection and avoid influence of ship agent during inspection of ship."

P.",Deepti  Ramadoss,2022-01-18,scientific communication and education,"In July 2021, sixteen months into the Covid-19 pandemic, the institutional climate for PhD training in the School of Medicine was assessed for a second time. This survey of graduate students occurred 1 year after initial surveys of graduate students and training faculty in July 2020. The 2021 survey was completed by 99 PhD students in 11 PhD-granting programs. To allow comparisons between years, most of the 2021 questions were repeated with only minor edits. A few items were added to assess impacts of school-wide town hall meetings, a new PhD career club program, and enlarged mental health services. Several themes emerged. Students remain extremely concerned about the pandemics impact upon their training and long-term career prospects. They worry specifically about pandemic related reductions in research productivity and networking opportunities. Many students successfully adapted to laboratory research under pandemic restrictions but suffer from the continuing lack of social interaction even after in-person work hours increased. Symptoms of anxiety and/or depression persist amongst 46% of the students, as compared to 51% in 2020. Nearly 80% of students continue to report strong satisfaction with mentoring relationships with their dissertation advisors, but to lesser extents with programs (66%), departments or centers (71%), the School of Medicine (32%) and the University (49%). Students (26%) express interest in the Ombuds office that was announced in late 2021. Some students wrote that the medical school could do a better job in embracing diversity and inclusion and in mentor training, and many stated that town hall meetings do not serve them well. Coping mechanisms shared by some students demonstrate impressive resilience. These results present a mixed picture. While aspects of biomedical PhD training have begun to recover as the pandemic continues, long-term consequences of the disruption raise challenges that must be addressed by efforts to restore and improve the learning environment required for 21st century research education."

Exploration involves identifying potential effects (high sensitivity), which are then tested more rigorously during confirmation (high specificity). Here, we examine different experimental strategies and their ability to balance sensitivity and specificity to identify relevant effects. In simulations based on empirical data, we specifically compare a conventional p-value based approach with a method based on an a priori determined smallest effect size of interest (SESOI). Using a SESOI increases transition rates from exploration to confirmation and leads to higher detection rates across the trajectory. In particular, specificity in the SESOI trajectory increases if number of true effects are low. We conclude that employing a SESOI is superior to a p-value based approach in many contexts. Based on our findings, we propose a reconsideration of planning and conducting preclinical experiments, especially when the prior probability of true hypotheses is low."

A.; Jeffrey, A.; Haustein, S.; Samuel, A.",Lauren A Maggio,2022-01-24,scientific communication and education,"IntroductionAcademia uses scholarly metrics, such as the h-index, to make hiring, promotion, and funding decisions. These high-stakes decisions require that those using scholarly metrics be able to recognize, interpret, critically assess and effectively and ethically use them. This study aimed to characterize educational videos about the h-index to understand available resources and provide recommendations for future educational initiatives.

MethodsThe authors analyzed videos on the h-index posted to YouTube. Videos were identified by searching YouTube and were screened by two authors. To code the videos the authors created a coding sheet, which assessed content and presentation style with a focus on the videos educational quality based on Cognitive Load Theory. Two authors coded each video independently with discrepancies resolved by group consensus.

ResultsThirty-one videos met inclusion criteria. Twenty-one videos (68%) were screencasts and seven used a ""talking head"" approach. Twenty-six videos defined the h-index (83%) and provided examples of how to calculate and find it. The importance of the h-index in high-stakes decisions was raised in 14 (45%) videos. Sixteen videos (52%) described caveats about using the h-index, with potential disadvantages to early researchers the most prevalent (n=7; 23%). All videos incorporated various educational approaches with potential impact on viewer cognitive load. Most videos (n=21; 68%) displayed amateurish production quality.

DiscussionThe videos featured content with potential to enhance viewers metrics literacies such that many defined the h-index and described its calculation, providing viewers with skills to recognize and interpret the metric. However, less than half described the h-index as an author quality indicator, which has been contested, and caveats about h-index use were inconsistently presented, suggesting room for improvement. While most videos integrated practices to facilitate balancing viewers cognitive load, few (32%) were of professional production quality. Some videos missed opportunities to adopt particular practices that could benefit learning."

Literacy in coding, statistics, and mathematical modeling enables students to engage in systems-thinking and the analysis of large data sets. Here we present a flexible tool illustrating concepts in mathematical modeling, coding, and biology for integration into both traditional  cookbook and inquiry-driven labs for freshmen biology students. We developed simple and complex mathematical models of potato catechol oxidase, a popular system to teach enzyme kinetics in undergraduate biology labs. We integrated both models into a freely-available web app for simulation and parameter estimation. The models are usable even if experimental details are unknown or poorly controlled, so that even novice students can work through the problem. We illustrate this by estimating the kinetic parameters of catechol oxidase in the complex model using data obtained from two sections of a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) freshman biology lab. Worksheets with questions motivating model building and simulation comprehension are provided. The effect of these exercises on students opinions of math, biology, and coding are evaluated using pre- and post-test surveys and student feedback. Our results show that these tools illustrate enzyme kinetics mathematically, students are not intimidated by the degree of math or coding involved, and in some cases are interested to do more, despite being unaware of the focus of the lab when signing up."

S.; Padureanu, L.; Toma, B.",Catalin S Toma,2022-01-25,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundWithdrawal of problematic scientific articles after publication is one of the mechanisms for correcting the literature available to publishers, especially in the conditions of the ever-increasing trend of publishing activity in the medical field. The market volume and the business model justify publishers involvement in the post-publication quality control(QC) of scientific production. The limited information about this subject determined us to analyze retractions and the main retraction reasons for publishers with many withdrawn articles. We also propose a score to measure the evolution of their performance. The data set used for this article consists of 4844 PubMed retracted papers published between 1.01.2009 and 31.12.2020.

MethodsWe have analyzed the retraction notes and retraction reasons, grouping them by publisher. To evaluate performance, we formulated an SDTP score whose calculation formula includes several parameters: speed (article exposure time(ET)), detection rate (percentage of articles whose retraction is initiated by the editor/publisher/institution without the authors participation), transparency (percentage of retracted articles available online and clarity of retraction notes), precision (mention of authors responsibility and percentage of retractions for reasons other than editorial errors).

ResultsThe 4844 withdrawn articles were published in 1767 journals by 366 publishers, the average number of withdrawn articles/journal being 2.74. Forty-five publishers have more than ten withdrawn articles, holding 88% of all papers and 79% of journals. Combining our data with data from another study shows that less than 7% of PubMed journals withdrew at least one article. Only 10.5% of the withdrawal notes included the individual responsibility of the authors. Nine of the top 11 publishers had the largest number of articles withdrawn in 2020, in the first 11 places finding, as expected, some big publishers. Retraction reasons analysis shows considerable differences between publishers concerning the articles ET: median values between 9 and 43 months (mistakes), 9 and 73 months (images), 10 and 42 months (plagiarism & overlap).

The SDTP score shows, between 2018 and 2020, an improvement in QC of four publishers in the top 11 and a decrease in the gap between 1st and 11th place. The group of the other 355 publishers also has a positive evolution of the SDTP score.

ConclusionsPublishers have to get involved actively and measurably in the post-publication evaluation of scientific products. The introduction of reporting standards for retraction notes and replicable indicators for quantifying publishing QC can help increase the overall quality of scientific literature."

In this letter, we present and discuss the results of a survey that was created and disseminated by members of the Graduate Student and Postdoc Ambassador Program at the 11th symposium of the International Society of Root Research. This survey aimed to (1) provide an overview of the objectives, biological models and methodological approaches used in root phenotyping studies, and (2) identify the main limitations currently faced by plant scientists with regard to root phenotyping.

Our survey highlighted that (1) monocotyledonous crops dominate the root phenotyping landscape, (2) root phenotyping is mainly used to quantify morphological and architectural root traits, (3) 2D root scanning/imaging is the most widely used root phenotyping technique, (4) time-consuming tasks are an important barrier to root phenotyping, (5) there is a need for standardised, high-throughput methods to sample and phenotype roots, particularly under field conditions, and to improve our understanding of trait-function relationships."

Focusing on the field of ecology and evolutionary biology, we analyzed the academic performance (measured as h-index) as well as the duration before recruitment as a new faculty member and promotion to full professor of 145 principal investigators (PI) over the past 34 years in Taiwan. We found that PIs had higher performance and longer duration before recruitment more recently. Performance before promotion remained stable, whereas the duration increased over time. The origin and prestige of doctorate had no effect on the performance or duration either before recruitment or before promotion. We also found that the difference in performance before and after recruitment (""After"" performance -- ""Before"" performance) decreased in recent years, with PIs recruited in earlier years maintaining their performance after recruitment while those recruited in later years exhibiting a performance drop. While PIs performed equally well before and after recruitment irrespective of doctorate origin, those with domestic PhD degrees showed a decrease in performance after promotion compared to their counterparts with foreign degrees. Taken together, our findings reveal a prolonged career duration for researchers as a result of intensifying competition in academia, and highlight the increasingly crucial role of academic performance, rather than PhD degree itself, in determining academic success."

S.; Cvetkovic, M.; Treu, D.; Gitter, A.",Anthony  Gitter,2022-02-04,scientific communication and education,"The increasing prevalence and importance of machine learning in biological research has created a need for machine learning training resources tailored towards biological researchers. However, existing resources are often inaccessible, infeasible, or inappropriate for biologists because they require significant computational and mathematical knowledge, demand an unrealistic time-investment, or teach skills primarily for computational researchers. We created the Machine Learning for Biologists (ML4Bio) workshop, a short, intensive workshop that empowers biological researchers to comprehend machine learning applications and pursue machine learning collaborations in their own research. The ML4Bio workshop focuses on classification and was designed around 3 principles: (a) focusing on preparedness over fluency or expertise, (b) necessitating minimal coding and mathematical background, and (c) requiring low time investment. It incorporates active learning methods and custom open source software that allows participants to explore machine learning workflows. After multiple sessions to improve workshop design, we performed a study on 3 workshop sessions. Despite some confusion around identifying subtle methodological flaws in machine learning workflows, participants generally reported that the workshop met their goals, provided them with valuable skills and knowledge, and greatly increased their beliefs that they could engage in research that uses machine learning. ML4Bio is an educational tool for biological researchers, and its creation and evaluation provides valuable insight into tailoring educational resources for active researchers in different domains.

Through thematic analysis of interviews conducted with 19 health and science journalists in the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic, it applies a theoretical framework that conceptualizes COVID-19 preprint research as a form of post-normal science, characterized by high scientific uncertainty and societal relevance, urgent need for political decision-making, and value-related policy considerations. Findings suggest that journalists approach the decision to cover preprints as a careful calculation, in which the potential public benefits and the ease of access preprints provided were weighed against risks of spreading misinformation. Journalists described viewing unreviewed studies with extra skepticism and relied on diverse strategies to find, vet, and report on them. Some of these strategies represent standard science journalism, while others, such as labeling unreviewed studies as preprints, mark a departure from the norm. However, journalists also reported barriers to covering preprints, as many felt they lacked the expertise or the time required to fully understand or vet the research. The findings suggest that coverage of preprints is likely to continue post-pandemic, with important implications for scientists, journalists, and the publics who read their work."

Its roots are an excellent source of energy, and its leaves are rich in minerals, vitamins, and protein, which could substantially supplement the current starchy diets if properly detoxified since they contain some toxic anti-nutritional factors. The objective of this study was to provide information on the nutritional profile of cassava root and leaves and role of processing in enhancing and stabilizing their valuable nutrients. Two cassava varieties, kello and qulle, obtained from Areca Agricultural Research Center were used in this study. Roots and leaves were processed (fermented, boiled, and fluid bed dried), and nutritional, anti-nutritional, and functional properties were assessed using AOAC (Association of Official Analytical Chemists) standard procedures. As compared to leaves, roots had higher carbohydrate contents, ranging from 81.0 to 87.1 g/100g, whereas leaves had higher protein (21.2 to 28.4g/100g), total carotenoid (234.1 to 987.9 g/g), fiber (16.1 to 22.9 g/100g), Ca (499.8 to 545.4 mg/100g), K (1193.4 to 1211.0 mg/100g), Mg (274.5 to 340.5 mg/100g) and Fe (129.1 to 146.1 mg/kg) contents. Anti-nutritional factors were slightly higher in the leaves than in the roots, with toxic cyanides ranging from 10.1 to 61.0 mg/kg in the leaves and from 1.8 to 47.5 mg/kg in the roots. However, the processing of leaves decreased cyanide content from 61.0 mg/kg to 10.1 mg/kg. Similarly, other anti-nutritional factors, such as condensed tannins, oxalates, and phytate were reduced from 52.0 to 21.0 mg/100g, 156.5 to 25.9 mg/100g, and 35.9 to 4.0 mg/100g), respectively. Hence, the fermentation of leaves and roots followed by boiling and drying is an interesting approach to reduce anti-nutritional factors significantly and ensure their nutritional quality. This study revealed that variety kello had a relatively better nutritional profile than variety qulle, for both root and leaves, except for total carotenoid content, which was higher in the latter. Genetic background and processing methods can greatly affect the nutritional profile of cassava varieties, so it is critical to analyze diverse cassava germplasm and refine the processing method to identify highly nutritious and healthy varieties."

In the past, colleges and graduate schools played a primary role in preparing students for various areas of industry and medicine. The learning process and introduction of new concepts have recently extended beyond college education. High schools saw the rise of specialized career programs, while both high and middle school curricula got infused with challenging concepts. Nucleic acids, such as DNA and RNA, are broadly known for their role in the foundation of life. However, nucleic acid nanotechnology, an area of material science manipulating DNA and RNA to create complex structures with controlled properties, is less known. Herein, I report the results of a study investigating the perception of RNA nanotechnology among school students and suggest educational resources to improve understanding of RNA nanotechnology."

B.; Fontaneto, D.; Petillon, J.",Stefano  Mammola,2022-02-09,scientific communication and education,"Theres a secret pleasure in naming new species. Besides traditional etymologies recalling the sampling locality, habitat, or morphology of the species, etymologies may be tributes to some meaningful person (for example, the species collector, the authors husband or wife, or a celebrity), pop culture references, and even exercises of enigmatography. The possibility of choosing witty or even playful names for new species departs from the otherwise impersonal and old-fashioned writing style thats common in taxonomic papers; but, how has the descriptors choice for specific etymologies changed over the 300+ years since the introduction of the Linnaean binomial system of nomenclature? Using an unprecedented dataset of 48,464 etymologies (all valid species and subspecies of spiders described between 1757 and May 2020), we tested the hypothesis that species names given by taxonomists are deeply influenced by their cultural background. In particular, we asked whether naming practices change through space (continent in which the species was found) or have changed through time (year of description). We observed spatial and temporal differences in the way taxonomists name new species. In absolute terms, etymologies referring to morphology were the most frequently used. In relative terms, however, references to morphology peaked in 1850-1900 and then began to decline, with a parallel increase in etymologies dedicated to people and geography. Currently, these are the most widely used, with [~]38% of all etymologies of spider species described in the last ten years referring to geography, [~]25% to people, and [~]25% to morphology. Interestingly, there has been a dramatic increase in etymologies referring to pop culture and other cultural aspects in the last two decades, especially in Europe and the Americas. While such fashionable names often carry little or no biological information regarding the species itself, they help give visibility to the science of taxonomy, a discipline currently facing a profound crisis within academia. Taxonomy is among the most unchanged disciplines across the last centuries in terms of background, tools, rules, and writing style; but our analysis suggests that taxonomists remain deeply influenced by their living time and space."

R.",Lauren  Maggio,2022-02-10,scientific communication and education,"IntroductionMedical education has been described as a dynamic and growing field, driven in part by its unique body of scholarship. The voices of authors who publish medical education literature have a powerful impact on the discourses of the community. While there have been numerous studies looking at aspects of this literature, there has been no comprehensive view of recent publications.

MethodThe authors conducted a bibliometric analysis of all articles published in 24 medical education journals published between 2000-2020 to identify article characteristics, with an emphasis on author gender, geographic location, and institutional affiliation. This study replicates and greatly expands on two previous investigations by examining all articles published in these core medical education journals.

ResultsThe journals published 37,263 articles with the majority of articles published in 2020 (n=3,957, 10.7%) and the least in 2000 (n=711, 1.9%) representing a 456.5% increase. The articles were authored by 139,325 authors of which 62,708 were unique. Males were more prevalent across all authorship positions (n=62,828; 55.7%) than females (n=49,975; 44.3%). Authors listed 154 country affiliations with the United States (n=42,236, 40.4%), United Kingdom (n=12,967, 12.4%), and Canada (n=10,481, 10.0%) most represented. Ninety-three countries (60.4%) were low- or middle-income countries accounting for 9,684 (9.3%) author positions. Few articles were written by multinational teams (n=3,765; 16.2%). Authors listed affiliations with 4,372 unique institutions. Across all author positions, 48,189 authors (46.1%) were affiliated with a top 200 institution, as ranked by the Times Higher Education ranking.

DiscussionThere is a relative imbalance of author voices in medical education. If the field values a diversity of perspectives, there is considerable opportunity for improvement."

E.; Ali, Z.",Zahid  Ali,2022-02-14,scientific communication and education,"Broussonetia papyrifera (B. papyrifera) is an allergenic plant in the mulberry family that grows at varied elevations and climatic conditions worldwide. In northern Pakistan, B. papyrifera is abundant and it produces a substantial amount of pollen that disperses in the air causing allergies in some humans. Climate change affects pollen production. To investigate potential changes in pollens development and potential allergenicity, B. papyrifera pollens were collected in summer and in spring from different regions in Pakistan. Study samples were subjected to morphological analysis, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis for biochemical differences, and Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LCMS) for metabolome analysis. Morphological studies of the dried pollen by light microscopy showed seasonal and regional differences in pollens size and exine morphology. FTIR analysis showed inter-regional and inter-seasonal differences in the metabolome of the pollen. Differences in lipid and protein functional groups of pollen from different regions showed variation in the FTIR spectra. These differences in FTIR spectra correlated with the changing climatic conditions. Metabolome analysis of targeted pollen samples identified 33 organic compounds of seven different groups. Four unsaturated fatty acids were identified that have a potential role in allergic responses. The findings in this study are unique in demonstrating climatic variables that effect B. papyrifera pollen physiology (FTIR analysis) which also confirms differences in pollen-associated lipid metabolites identified by LCMS analysis. These results demonstrate information that may be used to predict potential changes in allergy risks from pollens of B. papyrifera in the future. The findings may provide a model for predicting variation in pollen structure and associated allergies in response to climate changes for other species."

MethodsAll residents who started their SRT programme from September 2015 to September 2018 were enrolled in this study. During the following years, they finished the programme and took examinations. The demographic information and exam scores of each subject were collected and analyzed.

ResultsWe found that the qualification rates of SRT programme differed significantly annually. Age, gender, the highest medical education degree, residents from different places, training duration and years of medical school study were also different significantly year by year. According to the scores of examinations, residents were divided into two groups: the qualified group and the non-qualified group. Age, the highest medical education degree, residents from different places, training duration, years of medical school study and prior medical work experience differed significantly between the two groups. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed the residents from different places and the training duration were factors that affected the qualification rate of SRT programme independently (P = 0.000 and 0.005, respectively).

DiscussionThe ""homogeneity"" of SRT had been achieved regardless of the individual discrepancy, while the resident from different places and the training duration were obstacles we need to overcome further. Therefore, we should further advance the process of the transition from ""Unit Persons"" to ""Society Persons"". And extending training duration will facilitate their qualification and be benefit to improve their competency."

A growing field working to strengthen those connections exists within the informal STEM learning (ISL) community which provides diverse learning and engagement environments outside the formal classroom. One of the largest funders of ISL initiatives is the National Science Foundation (NSF) which runs the Advanced Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program in the United States. The AISL program supports initiatives through six categories that include pilots and feasibility studies, research in service to practice, innovations in development, broad implementation, literature reviews, syntheses, or meta-analyses, and conferences. However, a number of questions remain unanswered with respect to the distribution and ultimately the broad impact of the awards. In this study, we analyzed publicly available awardee information across a 15-year period (2006-2021) to provide a preliminary analysis of how the AISL grants are distributed across individual states, organizations, and the principal investigators. Several states, organizations, and principal investigators stood out as prolific awardees. Massachusetts and California represented the largest share of awards at 14% and 13% respectively during that time. WGBH Educational Foundation located in Massachusetts and the Exploratorium located in California, received the largest number of awards during the 15 year period. Notably, 67% of the AISL awards list at least one co-principal investigator. Our report brings to light a number of new questions and charts new paths of exploration for future studies."

Additionally, the relative ease of use and implementation for some super-resolution microscopes provided hope that this technology would be widely available and accessible. Despite initial excitement, super-resolution microscopy is still largely limited to facilities that can afford expensive commercial instruments or with personnel experienced in optical engineering that can construct an instrument. Recently, the open scientific hardware movement has attempted to make scientific instrumentation more widely available and accessible in a similar way to the open software movement. The widespread availability and affordability of prototyping devices, such as three-dimensional printers and interfaces (e.g., Arduino) have all contributed to unlocking the potential of the open hardware movement, turning expensive ""black box"" hardware into open-source, affordable, and robust instrumentation. Many others have recognized the potential of describing low-cost implementations of super-resolution microscope designs. However, we have found these microscope designs lacking in the documentation and details required to meet the requirements of open-source hardware. In this paper, we attempt to provide the documentation, details, and instructions necessary for the construction of an open-source and low-cost super-resolution microscope at a targeted cost of <$15,000."

Professional satisfaction and patient care improve in a pleasant learning environment; where postgraduate physicians are encouraged, suitably supervised, and fostered. A negative learning environment can be detrimental to trainees and teams morale and can jeopardize the multidisciplinary working relationship.

ObjectivesThe objective of this study was to measure the Educational Environment (EE) of Psychiatry postgraduate training in the Midwest of Ireland training Deanery; what aspects of training are working well and what areas are seen as not optimal.

MethodsThis study took place between April and June 2021. A mixed methods approach was adopted, using the Postgraduate Hospital Educational Environment Measure (PHEEM) and semi-structured one-to-one interviews.

ResultsResponse rate was 88% (n=22). The total PHEEM score was 105.64{+/-}23.52, indicating a postgraduate EE with more positive than negative aspects, but with room for improvement. There were no differences in overall PHEEM and subscale scores between trainees gender, training grades or years of working experience. Three themes were identified that contribute to trainees perception of EE: the commitment of the trainees supervisors to the role they play in trainees overall development, the clinical workload of the trainee, and the day-to-day working conditions of the trainee. Definite disparities between work placements were evident in the collected data across these three themes.

ConclusionsAlthough the training program had an overall positive EE, specific answers and interview themes indicated some areas of weakness that may contribute to trainee dissatisfaction and possible burnout. Planned interventions targeting these areas and tracking changes in EE and burnout rates over time may be useful measures going forward.

Religious beliefs have already been described as affecting mind-body dualistic thinking. Another factor that may play a role is knowledge of evolutionary theory, but this relationship has not been explored. In this work, data on knowledge of evolutionary theory and supernatural and dualistic beliefs of 287 Argentinian students of psychology and medicine majors. were collected through a cross-sectional online survey. Information was analyzed to determine whether an association exists between knowledge of evolutionary theory, supernatural beliefs and dualism. We found significant statistical associations between supernatural beliefs and dualism (positive) and between both and knowledge of evolutionary theory (negative). Also, some heterogeneity was found within dualistic questions between theoretical ones and a hypothetical case. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that knowledge of evolutionary theory could challenge mind-body dualistic conceptions."

Bukhari,2022-03-10,scientific communication and education,"Working donkeys (Equus asinus) are vital to peoples livelihoods. They are essential for carrying goods, however globally, overloading is one of the primary welfare concerns of working donkeys. We studied mounted load carrying by donkeys and associated factors in Pakistan. A cross-sectional study of donkey owners (n = 332) was conducted, and interviews were undertaken based on a questionnaire. Owners estimated that the median weight of their donkeys was 110kg (interquartile range (IQR) 100-120kg), and that they carried a median mounted load of 81.5kg (IQR 63-99kg). We found that 87.4% of donkeys carried a load above 50% of their bodyweight ratio (BWR), the median BWR carried was 77.1% (IQR 54.5-90.7%), and 25.3% of donkeys carried above 90% BWR. Donkeys that were loaded at more than 50% BWR were more likely to sit, compared to donkeys loaded with less weight (p=0.01). Donkeys working in peri-urban and urban areas were more likely to carry a greater BWR than donkeys working in rural areas (P<0.001), as were those carrying construction materials or bricks, compared to agricultural materials (p=0.004). Age (p=0.03) and breed (p=0.01) were also associated with carrying a higher weight. Overloading based on current recommendations (50% BWR) was common, with the majority (87.4%) of donkeys reported to carry more than the recommended 50% limit. This survey provides evidence of on-the-ground working practices and factors associated with mounted load carrying, which is critical for developing evidence-based recommendations for loading, in order to improve the welfare of working donkeys."

L.",Tracey L Weissgerber,2022-03-15,scientific communication and education,"Recent work has raised awareness about the need to replace bar graphs of continuous data with informative graphs showing the data distribution. The impact of these efforts is not known. This observational meta-research study examined how often scientists in different fields use various graph types, and assessed whether visualization practices have changed between 2010 and 2020. We developed and validated an automated screening tool, designed to identify bar graphs of counts or proportions, bar graphs of continuous data, bar graphs with dot plots, dot plots, box plots, violin plots, histograms, pie charts, and flow charts. Papers from 23 fields (approximately 1,000 papers/field/year) were randomly selected from PubMed Central and screened (n=227,998). F1 scores for different graphs ranged between 0.83 and 0.95 in the internal validation set. While the tool also performed well in external validation sets, F1 scores were lower for uncommon graphs. Bar graphs are more often used incorrectly to display continuous data than they are used correctly to display counts or proportions. The proportion of papers that use bar graphs of continuous data varies markedly across fields (range in 2020: 4%-58%), with high rates in biochemistry and cell biology, complementary and alternative medicine, physiology, genetics, oncology and carcinogenesis, pharmacology, microbiology and immunology. Visualization practices have improved in some fields in recent years. Fewer than 25% of papers use flow charts, which provide information about attrition and the risk of bias. This study highlights the need for continued interventions to improve visualization and identifies fields that would benefit most."

M.",Shelley  Marie  Fischer,2022-03-15,scientific communication and education,"Composite indices have been widely used to rank the environmental performance of nations. Such environmental indices can be useful in communicating complex information as a single value and have the potential to generate political and media awareness of environmental issues. However, indices that are poorly constructed can hinder efforts to identify environmental failings. Here, we provide a critical review of the theoretical and methodological foundations of environmental indices to enhance our understanding of the accuracy and applicability of such indices. In the present study we classify existing indices according to ranking goal, measurement components, and weighting methods. Using New Zealand and Niger as case studies, we examine correlations between ranks in ten national level indices to outline how measurement components and the goal of ranking itself may provide a more, or less, optimistic view of the state of a countrys environment. Our results suggest that environmental indices that include human health, socioeconomic, and policy indicators (such as human access to sanitation and clean drinking water) are positively correlated with each other, and that those excluding human health, socioeconomic, and policy indicators are also positively correlated with each other, while these two types of environmental indices are negatively correlated to each other. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of indicators that do not relate to the actual state of natural environments can confound results. When choosing an existing environmental index - or developing a new one - it is important to assess whether the ranking goal and the included indicators are appropriate. This is important because the inclusion of confounding indicators in environmental indices may misrepresent the actual state of natural environments."

M.; Brook, R. K.",Amanda M MacDonald,2022-03-16,scientific communication and education,"Invasive wild pigs are a global problem and are established in large areas across Canada. Domestic European wild boar were first introduced to Canadian farms in the 1980s, and their escape and intentional release have since led to free-ranging populations, which have expanded rapidly in numbers and range. Wild pigs are associated with widespread damage to crops and natural environments, as well as risks of disease transmission. African Swine Fever (ASF) is a highly contagious viral disease of global concern, that can spread between domestic and free-ranging swine and cause catastrophic economic impacts. As ASF preparedness requires a detailed understanding of the distribution and movements of all pig types, this paper aimed to characterize an unregulated  grey swine market in Canada to understand risks to domestic swine production and potential contributions to free-ranging wild pig populations. Kijiji.ca is a free Canadian internet classified advertising service, almost exclusively cash-based with no receipts and few, if any, records kept of transactions. We monitored Kijiji for sales of domestic wild boar, pot-bellied pigs, and their hybrids across Canada over two months from April 28 - June 30, 2021. Data was collected from all advertisements, including how the seller labelled pigs breed, age, sex, number for sale, sexual intactness, presence of tattoos and/or ear tags, as well as the date and location of the posting. Locations were mapped and compared to the spatial distribution of existing free-ranging wild pigs in Canada to identify areas they were likely to facilitate new populations or potentially supplement and genetically diversify existing populations. We identified 151 advertisements on Kijiji, the most coming from Ontario (34.4%; n = 52) and Alberta (29.1%; n = 44), followed by Saskatchewan (11.3%; n = 17), British Columbia (10.6%; n = 16), Nova Scotia (7.3%; n = 11), New Brunswick (4.0%; n = 6), Manitoba (2.0%; n = 3), Quebec (0.7%; n = 1), and Prince Edward Island (0.7%; n = 1). No listings were observed in Newfoundland and Labrador, or Yukon, Nunavut and Northwest Territories. Overall, 62 (41%) of advertisements were within watersheds with existing wild pigs that may contribute to supplementing additional swine, and 89 (59%) were within watersheds where wild pigs have not yet been identified. African swine fever preparedness should include policies and action to address this unmonitored and unregulated sale of swine in Canada, including ear tags, tattoos, genetic analysis, and mandatory reporting."

It was developed in close collaboration with the academic evaluation community and international experts, introduced through detailed change management and finally tested in its utility by an independent research team of the Center for Science and Technology Studies Leiden (CWTS).

MethodsWe present the development of the SciCV pilot and its evaluation by the CWTS research group. The analysis comprised both quantitative and qualitative methods, with (i) surveys and semi-structured interviews with applicants and reviewers, (ii) text analysis of the narrative elements of SciCV, and (iii) participant observation in ten evaluation panel meetings.

ResultsNarrative elements and the inclusion of the academic age were rated as most useful new CV elements, while the inclusion of two metrics, the h-index and the relative citation ratio, were received more critically. The omission of a full publication list had similar numbers of supporters and opponents among applicants and reviewers. Less experienced and junior applicants and reviewers rated the new format generally more positively than more senior applicants and reviewers. The text analysis of narrative elements yielded no significant gender specific differences. The participant observation revealed that the new elements in SciCV broadened the information base used in the evaluation of applicants but did not fundamentally alter traditional, publication-centred evaluation practices.

ConclusionSciCV was a relevant and successful initiative for the SNSF, which showed that the implementation of a new, well-structured CV format is not only feasible but also something that many stakeholders welcome.The extensive experience and results obtained during the change process formed the basis for the development of SciCV 2.0 at the SNSF. It also offers a basis and guidance for other funding organisations planning similar initiatives."

R.",Stephen B Heard,2022-03-19,scientific communication and education,"Titles of scientific papers pay a key role in their discovery, and ""good"" titles engage and recruit readers. A particularly interesting aspect of title construction is the use of humour, but little is known about whether funny titles boost or limit readership and citation of papers. We used a panel of volunteer scorers to assess title humour for 2,439 papers in ecology and evolution, and measured associations between humour scores and subsequent citation (both self-citation and citation by others). Papers with funnier titles were cited less often, but this appears to result from a confound with paper importance. Self-citation data suggest that authors give funnier titles to papers they consider less important. After correction for this confound, papers with funny titles have significantly higher citation rates, suggesting that humour recruits readers. We also examined associations between citation rates and several other features of titles. Inclusion of acronyms and taxonomic names was associated with lower citation rates, while assertive-statement phrasing and presence of colons, question marks, and political regions were associated with somewhat higher citation rates. Title length had no effect on citation. Our results suggest that scientists can use creativity with titles without having their work condemned to obscurity."

This type of meeting format was rare pre-COVID-19 but started to become more common recently given the asynchronous global progression of the pandemic and the uneven access and distribution of vaccines that led to a large proportion of participants being unable to attend international conferences in person. Here we report the organization of a middle-sized (581 participants: 159 onsite, 422 online) international hybrid conference that took place in France in September 2021. We highlight particular organizational challenges inherent to this relatively new type of meeting format. Furthermore, we surveyed both in-person and online participants to better understand their conference experience and to propose improvements based on the feedback received. Finally, we compare the advantages and disadvantages of three types of conferences (onsite-only, online-only and hybrid) and suggest that hybrid events should be favored in the future because they offer the most flexibility to participants. We conclude by proposing suggestions and ways forward to maximize accessibility and inclusivity of hybrid conferences."

Yet, the underlying mechanism of how parenting is associated with career achievement gaps of academics remains unclear. Using data from a large-scale survey distributed to 7,764 scholars and their publication profiles from the Web of Science database, we analyze the gender differences in parenthood, academic achievements, and the mediation effect of work-family conflict and partner support in these gender gaps. Our results suggest that gender gaps in academic achievements are in fact ""parenthood gaps"". Specifically, we found significant gender gaps exist in all measures of objective and subjective career achievements of academics in the parent group but not in the non-parent group. Additionally, mothers are more likely than fathers to experience higher levels of work-family conflict, and receive lower levels of partner support, contributing significantly to the gender gaps in objective and subjective career achievements for the parent group. Findings from this study identify the forms and the impact of parenthood on gender disparities in career achievements of academics and shed light on possible interventions and actions for mitigating gender inequalities in academia."

Krebs,2022-03-27,scientific communication and education,"Publication of scientific findings is fundamental for research, pushing innovation and generating interventions that benefit society, but it is not without biases. Publication bias is generally recognized as journals preference for publishing studies based on the direction and magnitude of results. However, early evidence of a newly recognized type of publication bias has emerged in which journal policy, peer reviewers, or editors request that animal data be provided to validate studies produced using nonanimal-based approaches. We describe herein ""animal methods bias"" in publishing: a preference for animal-based methods where they may not be necessary or where nonanimal-based methods may be suitable, which affects the likelihood of a manuscript being accepted for publication. To gather evidence of animal methods bias, we set out to collect the experiences and perceptions of scientists and reviewers related to animal- and nonanimal-based experiments during peer review. We created a survey with 33 questions that was completed by 90 respondents working in various biological fields. Twenty-one survey respondents indicated that they have carried out animal-based experiments for the sole purpose of anticipating reviewer requests. Thirty-one survey respondents indicated that they have been asked by peer reviewers to add animal experimental data to their nonanimal study; 14 of these felt the request was sometimes justified, and 11 did not think it was justified. The data presented provide preliminary evidence of animal methods bias and indicate that status quo and conservatism biases may explain such attitudes by peer reviewers and editors."

Creating an inclusive environment in a lab setting that provides a sense of belonging to all is challenging. This is particularly true in a field like Biomedical Engineering/Bioengineering where diversity is multifaceted and includes peoples diverse personal/cultural backgrounds and also diverse scientific backgrounds. In a research lab, there is additional diversity in training, as most labs contain trainees at different levels (undergrad, grad, postdoc, high school). To aid in creating a sense of belonging in a research lab, we have devised a novel initiative based upon open group discussions on diversity, equity, and inclusion topics. The initiative included a first presentation/discussion by the PI to set the stage for defining diversity, equity, and inclusion, and provided examples of existing DEI issues within our field, such as lack of racial diversity in awards like the NIH New Innovator Award and among conference speakers. After the initial presentation, trainee-led, bi-weekly-structured discussions were maintained. First, discussions focused broadly on any DEI related topic to enhance general knowledge on DEI issues and provide discussion comfort among the group. Second, there was a period to deepen knowledge of a specific topic (in our example, microaggressions), which was followed up with a period of discussions on potential solutions (such as how to react when observing a microaggression and what to do in response to realizing ones own microaggression). Students reported that our discussions were the only ones they have had in their training thus far, and felt that these discussions made them feel like they belonged in the lab, made the lab more inclusive, enhanced their awareness of how to create inclusive spaces, and taught them about a variety of DEI topics. Overall, our DEI discussions have fostered open conversations within our lab group about DEI-related issues and topics at the lab, department, university, and countrywide levels and has established a space where students feel safe to voice their opinions and ask questions. We hope to ultimately use these DEI discussions to create actionable steps for addressing topics, e.g., microaggressions, in different scenarios that can be applied by group members in their future careers."
10.1101/2022.03.30.486442,Defining Predictors of Successful Early Career to Independent Funding Conversion Among Surgeon-Scientists,"Keswani, S. S.; Short, W. D.; Mehl, S. C.; Singampalli, K. L.; Parikh, U. M.; Potturu, M.; Masri, L.; Olutoye, O. O.; Cheng, L. S.; King, A.; Lee, T. C.",Walker Douglas Short,2022-04-01,scientific communication and education,"IntroductionThe National Institutes of Health (NIH) provides research funding to scientists at different stages of their career through a range of grant awards. Early-stage researchers are eligible for mentored Career Development (K) awards, to aid in the transition to independent NIH funding. Factors such as education, subspecialty, and time to funding have been studied as predictors of obtaining independent awards in nonsurgical specialties. However, in surgery, the importance of these factors has yet to be clearly elucidated. We aim to identify predictors of K to independent award conversion among surgeon-scientists to understand how to better support early-stage researchers transitioning to independent careers.

Materials and MethodsIn July 2020, the NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools database was queried for individuals affiliated with surgery departments who received NIH Career Development Awards (between 2000 and 2020). The following factors were analyzed: publications, institution, degrees, year of completion of training, and gender.

ResultsBetween 2000 and 2020, 228 surgeons received K Awards, of which 44% transitioned to independent funding. On average, surgeons received a K award 4.0 years after completing fellowship training and an independent award 5.4 years after receiving a K grant. The time to receiving a K award was predictive of successfully achieving independent funding, and those with independent funding had a significantly greater number of publications per year of their K-award.

ConclusionSurgeons successful in transitioning to independent NIH awards do so approximately 9 years after finishing fellowship. Publication track record is the main factor associated with successful conversion from a K award. Surgery departments should emphasize manuscript productivity and develop strategies to minimize time to independent funding to help K-awardees begin independent research careers."

P.; Hardy, R.; Hart, K. M.; Sasso, C. R.; Stokes, L.; Riley, K. L.",Nicholas  A.  Farmer,2022-04-07,scientific communication and education,"Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) provides a process that uses spatial data and models to evaluate environmental, social, economic, cultural, and management trade-offs when siting ocean industries. Aquaculture is the fastest-growing food sector in the world. The U.S. has substantial opportunity for offshore aquaculture development given the size of its exclusive economic zone, habitat diversity, and variety of candidate species for cultivation. However, many protected species rely upon habitats that overlap with promising aquaculture areas. Siting surveys, farm construction, operations, and decommissioning can alter the habitat and behavior of animals in the vicinity of these activities. Vessel activity, underwater noise, and physical interactions between protected species and farms can potentially increase the risk of injury or cause direct mortality. In 2020, the U.S. Gulf of Mexico was identified as one of the first regions to be evaluated for offshore aquaculture opportunities as directed by a Presidential Executive Order. We developed a generalized scoring model for protected species data layers that captures vulnerability using species conservation status and demographic information. We applied this approach to data layers for eight species listed under the Endangered Species Act, including five species of sea turtles, Rices Whale, Smalltooth Sawfish, and Giant Manta Ray. We evaluated several methods for scoring (e.g., arithmetic mean, geometric mean, product, lowest scoring layer) and created a combined protected species data layer that was used within a multi-criteria decision-making modeling framework for MSP. The product approach for scoring provided the most logical ordering of and the greatest contrast in site suitability scores. This approach provides a transparent and repeatable method to identify aquaculture site alternatives with the least conflict with protected species. These modeling methods are transferable to other regions, to other sensitive or protected species, and for spatial planning for other ocean-uses."

Tick-borne diseases continue to spread to new geographical regions affecting both animal and human health. In Ghana, there is limited information on the circulating tick-borne pathogens and their risk of infections. This military-to-military vector surveillance study focused on seven sites in Ghana: Navrongo, Airforce Base, 6th Battalion Infantry, Air Borne Force, Army Recruit Training School, 1st Battalion Infantry and 5th Battalion Infantry for detection of tick-borne pathogens. Ticks from these sites were collected by hand-picking with a pair of forceps from domesticated animals including cattle, sheep, goats and dogs. A total of 2,016 ticks were collected from two main ecological zones; the northern Sahel savannah and the coastal savannah. Amblyomma variegatum was the predominant species, accounting for 59.5% of the collected ticks. Next-generation sequencing allowed for Dugbe virus whole genome detection. This study reports the second detection of Dugbe virus in Ghana, which is closely related to Dugbe virus strains from Kenya and Nigeria. This study (sponsored by the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch-Global Emerg-ing Infections Surveillance Section) aimed to better inform Force Health Protection (FHP) decisions within the U.S. AFRICOM area of responsibility, the Ghana Armed Forces, and enhance global health security countermeasures. Further surveillance needs to be conducted within the country to determine the distribution of tick-borne pathogens to formulate effective control measures.

Author summaryThe prevalence of Dugbe virus in tick species within Ghana was investigated. This study involved seven sampling sites that covered two ecological zones, the northern Sahel savannah and the coastal savannah. About 2,000 ticks were collected from cattle, sheep, goats and dogs and identified using a dissecting microscope. The most predominant tick species was Amblyomma variegatum (59.5%) also known as the tropical bont tick. Using Next-generation sequencing, the full genome of Dugbe virus was for the first time in Ghana identified in A. variegatum. This positive Amblyomma variegatum was collected from the Greater Accra region of Ghana within a military site. The virus was found to be related to Dugbe virus strains from Kenya and Nigeria. Findings from this study show that the trade of livestock across borders facilitates the spread of tick-borne pathogens hence there is a need to enforce measures that prevent the importation of potentially harmful ticks and tick-borne pathogens."

However, although disparities across research fields and techniques are not unknown, they remain largely unexplored. The present scoping review aims to provide a first overview of statistical methods used in biochemical research involving immunoblotting (also referred to as western blotting), a technique frequently used to quantify proteins of interest. A reverse chronological systematic sampling was implemented to explore the PubMed online browser and analyse 2932 experimental conditions (i.e., experimental groups) in quantitative immunoblots from 64 articles published at the end of 2021. The statistical test (actual study size n = 67) and software (actual study size n = 61) used for each article and the sample size for each experimental condition were documented. The results indicate an omnipresence of parametric tests, mostly one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA, 15/67) and Students t-test (13/67), but for many articles the statistical procedure was not clearly divulged (23/67). GraphPad Prism was the most commonly used statistical package (36/61), but many (14/61) articles did not reveal the package used. Finally, the sample size was clearly disclosed in only 1054/2932 conditions in which its median value was 3 (IQR = [3 - 6]). This study suggests that the transparency of reporting might be suboptimal in immunoblotting research and prompts more comprehensive systematic reviews in future."

In this study we assess the nutritional content of all commercial plant-based products across multiple sectors (supermarkets, fast food & sit down restaurants, food delivery companies and manufacturers) in the US, UK and Canada. We identified 3488 unique products. Across all sectors, 45% of main meals had >15g protein, 60% had <10%kcal from saturated fat; 29% had >10g fibre per meal; 86% had <1000mg sodium. At restaurants, meat-based main meals were significantly higher in protein and sodium compared to vegetarian and vegan meals. The meat-based options were also significantly higher in saturated fat than the vegan but not vegetarian options. We conclude that plant-based items tend to be lower in saturated fat and sodium than their meat-based counterparts but improvements are needed to optimise their nutritional composition."

Here we report on a survey (N = 132) that highlights academics dissatisfaction with the status quo and their support for an alternative approach. We then describe our view of how amendments could and should work by drawing on the idea of an author-led version control system. Here authors would include a link in their published manuscripts to an updatable website (e.g. a GitHub repository or similar) that could be disseminated in the event of any amendment. Such a system is already in place for computer code and, as such, requires nothing but buy-in from the scientific community - a community that is already evolving towards various open science frameworks. This would remove a number of frictions that discourage amendments thus leading to an improved scientific literature and a healthier academic climate."

Through the analysis of Twitter posts, using the hashtag #BlackintheIvory, this study investigates the main themes identified among Black scholars in academia and their shared experiences with teaching, mentoring, collegiality, identity, service, and racism.

MethodsUsing the Twitter API, we isolated all publicly available tweets, which can include text, images, and links to websites, posted with the hashtag #BlackintheIvory on the Twitter website (www.twitter.com) from the inception of the hashtag in June 2020 to the end of December 2020. To evaluate the tweets, we categorized the tweets inductively. Based on the content of the posts, we identified 6 themes: Teaching, Mentoring, Collegiality, Identity, Service, and Racism.

ResultsOur search yielded a total of 12,538 original posts, including tweets between inception in June 2020 to December 2020 from profiles made public (excluding modified tweets and duplicate tweets). We selected and analyzed the top retweeted 2500 tweets, which is 20% (2500/12538) of the total number of downloaded tweets. The greatest percentage of posts were about Teaching (881; 35%), followed by Service (441; 18%) and Racism (414; 17%). The remaining tweets were categorized as Collegiality (388; 15%), Identity (210; 8%), and Mentoring (166; 7%) of the total number of tweets from June-December 2020.

ConclusionThe experiences, perspectives, and narratives among the Black diaspora within #BlackintheIvory are not uniform. The commonality exists within the structural systemic racism which impacts Black academics within the ivory tower, this study is a resounding wake-up call for action.

Modern data-driven research has the power to promote novel biomedical discoveries through secondary analysis of such data. Therefore, it is important to ensure data-driven research with great reproducibility and robustness for promoting a precise and accurate secondary analysis of the immunogenomics data. In scientific research, rigorous conduct in designing and conducting experiments is needed, specifically in scientific and articulate writing, reporting and interpreting results. It is also crucial to make raw data available, discoverable, and well described or annotated in order to promote future re-analysis of the data. In order to assess the data availability of published T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire data, we examined 11,918 TCR-Seq samples corresponding to 134 TCR-Seq studies ranging from 2006 to 2022. Among the 134 studies, only 38.1% had publicly available raw TCR-Seq data shared in public repositories. We also found a statistically significant association between the presence of data availability statements and the increase in raw data availability (p=0.014). Yet, 46.8% of studies with data availability statements failed to share the raw TCR-Seq data. There is a pressing need for the biomedical community to increase awareness of the importance of promoting raw data availability in scientific research and take immediate action to improve its raw data availability enabling cost-effective secondary analysis of existing immunogenomics data by the larger scientific community."

Public exams attempt to authentically involve students into the process of assessment through the use of pre-released portions of the exam. Using mixed-methods research techniques at a closely matched pair of institutions (a research-intensive university and a community college classroom), we observed signals of positive impact from the public exam on student learning experiences. Public exams appear to promote deeper thought, to direct students more efficiently to the core concepts in the discipline, and to decrease student anxiety around exams. The public exam experience does not show evidence for exacerbating gaps in exam outcomes for students from underrepresented backgrounds. This suggests that public exams are worth deeper investigation as an evidence-based and effective assessment style."

However, due to holidays, coordination of training dates among hospitals, and vacation of other reasons, the actual training time in the Department of Infectious Diseases might be insufficient.

ObjectiveI aimed to explore Flipped Teaching with Video Conference as the carrier in infectious disease training for internal medicine residents, to make up for the lack of actual training time of the Department of Infectious Diseases for those residents caused by vacation, and to ensure the smooth implementation and quality assurance of infectious disease training for those residents.

MethodsVertical management mode was adopted, management team and lecturer team were established, and training program and teaching implementation were formulated. Flipped Teaching based on Video Conference was carried out for internal medicine residents of dispatched hospitals who planned to participate in infectious diseases training of the designated hospital in April. The quantitative analysis was applied to this teaching evaluation, and the evaluation indexes were included into statistical analysis to evaluate the effect of the teaching model.

ResultsAll 19-member internal medicine residents participated in the Flipped Teach based on Video Conference from April 1 to 4, of which 12 residents were scheduled to participate in infectious diseases training from March 1 to April 30, and 7 residents were scheduled to participate in infectious diseases training from April 1 to May 31. A management team of 6 internal medicine residents was built, and a group of 12 lecturers were composed of 12 those residents who were scheduled to receive infectious diseases training in the designated hospital from March 1 to April 30. According to the requirements of training diseases in the Department of Infectious Diseases, 12 training contents were selected to carry out teaching, and the implementation rate of teaching plan was over 90%. A total of 197 feedback questionnaires were collected. The feedback that the teaching quality was ""good"" and ""very good"" accounted for more than 96%, and the attendance rate of the whole teaching process reached more than 94%. About this teaching, 6 internal medicine residents put forward 18 suggestions of ""Improvement suggestions"", accounting for 9.1%; and 11 internal medicine residents gave 110 suggestions of ""Praise highlights"", accounting for 55.8%. The overall evaluation feedback of flipped teaching was good, P<0.001.

ConclusionFlipped Teach based on Video Conference was generally effective in carrying out for internal medicine residents participating in the infectious diseases training, and it could be used as a supplementary training method for standardized training of internal medicine residents to make up for the shortage of actual training period in a certain stage."

D.; Lopez, P.",Sarah  Jovan,2022-04-22,scientific communication and education,"Heavy metals concentrations often vary at small spatial scales not captured by air monitoring networks, with implications for environmental justice in industrial-adjacent communities. Pollutants measured in moss tissues are commonly used as a screening tool to guide use of more expensive resources, like air monitors. Such studies, however, rarely address environmental justice issues or involve the residents and other decision-makers expected to utilize results. Here, we piloted a community science approach, engaging over 55 people from nine institutions, to map heavy metals using moss in two industrial-adjacent neighborhoods. This area, long known for disproportionately poor air quality, health outcomes, and racial inequities, has only one monitor for heavy metals. Thus, an initial understanding of spatial patterns is critical for gauging whether, where, and how to invest further resources towards investigating heavy metals. Local youth led sampling of the moss Orthotrichum lyellii from trees across a 250x250-m sampling grid (n = 79) and generated data comparable to expert-collected samples (n = 19). We mapped 21 chemical elements measured in moss, including 6 toxic  priority metals: arsenic, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, lead, and nickel. Compared to other urban O. lyellii studies, local moss had substantially higher priority metals, especially arsenic and chromium, encouraging community members to investigate further. Potential hotspots of priority metals varied somewhat but tended to peak near the central industrial core where many possible emissions sources, including legacy contamination, converge. Informed by these findings, community members successfully advocated regulators for a second study phase - a community-directed air monitoring campaign to evaluate residents exposure to heavy metals - as is needed to connect moss results back to the partnerships core goal of understanding drivers of health disparities. This follow-up campaign will measure metals in the PM10 fraction owing to clues in the current study that airborne soil and dust may be locally important carriers of priority metals. Future work will address how our approach combining bioindicators and community science ultimately affects success addressing longstanding environmental justice concerns. For now, we illustrate the potential to co-create new knowledge, to help catalyze and strategize next steps, in a complex air quality investigation."

Scientists are very selective in who they are following as compared to the general public. We also found that the type of tweets and retweets one posts may affect the number of followers, specifically, that a moderate to high level of professionalism and a high level of positivity is correlated with followers count. Moreover, female scientists send fewer negative tweets as compared to male scientists (31.1% for females and 34.7% for males). Our analysis could provide insights and launch a conversation on the advantages and limitations of using Twitter for disseminating scientific information and engaging in constructive discussion and collaborations within the scientific community."

E.; Vjestica, A.; Greshake Tzovoras, B.; Masselot, C.; Lawton, E.; Haenel, L.; Blondel, L.; Santolini, M.",Marc  Santolini,2022-04-26,scientific communication and education,"Resource allocation is essential to the selection and implementation of innovative projects in science and technology. With large stakes involved in concentrating large fundings over a few promising projects, current ""winner-take-all"" models for grant applications are time-intensive endeavours that mobilise significant researcher time in writing extensive project proposals, and rely on the availability of a few time-saturated volunteer experts. Such processes usually carry over several months, resulting in high effective costs compared to expected benefits. Faced with the need for a rapid response to the Covid19 pandemic in 2020, we devised an agile ""community review"" system to allocate micro-grants for the fast prototyping of innovative solutions. Here we describe and evaluate the implementation of this community review across 147 projects from the ""Just One Giant Labs OpenCOVID19 initiative"" and ""Helpful Engineering"" open research communities. The community review process uses granular review forms and requires the participation of grant applicants in the review process. Within a year, we organised 7 rounds of review, resulting in 614 reviews from 201 reviewers, and the attribution of 48 micro-grants of up to 4,000 euros. We show that this system is fast, with a median process duration of 10 days, scalable, with a median of 4 reviewers per project independent of the total number of projects, and fair, with project rankings highly preserved after the synthetic removal of reviewers. We investigate the potential bias introduced by involving applicants in the process, and find that review scores from both applicants and non-applicants have a similar correlation of r=0.28 with other reviews within a project, matching previous observations using traditional approaches. Finally, we find that the ability of projects to apply to several rounds allows to both foster the further implementation of successful early prototypes, as well as provide a pathway to constructively improve an initially failing proposal in an agile manner. Overall, this study quantitatively highlights the benefits of a frugal, community review system acting as a due diligence for rapid and agile resource allocation in open research and innovation programs, with particular implications for decentralised communities."

Explanations of the Lack of Research Citations in their Health Vlogs","Atef, N.",Noha  Atef,2022-04-26,scientific communication and education,"Doctor-influencers have the knowledge needed to understand scientific research, and they have the social media popularity to share it with large audiences. In this article, I explore the treatment of evidence in vlogs by Egyptian doctor-influencers: how they present it and what they use instead of it. I answer the following questions: 1) How do doctor-influencers present evidence on social media? 2) If evidence is not the research, then what is it? The data was collected through in-depth interviews with 12 Egyptian doctor-influencers from different specializations; two focus groups; and a critical discourse analysis of 48 of the influencers most popular and most engaging videos. I found that the doctor-influencers cited academic research only in the videos about medical controversies, new treatments, misinformation, or common medical mistakes. In most of their videos, the Egyptian doctor-influencers scarcely referred to medical research. This is because they believe that their audiences would not understand evidence due to their low educational attainment, weak research skills, and the language barrier (as most medical research is published in English rather than Arabic). These findings highlight the challenges of communicating science in societies with a low level of education. In these settings, communicators may need to move beyond mediating research studies on social media and instead focus on simplifying, translating, and connecting evidence-based information to the cultural context."

A.; Kleppner, S.; Tsao, P.; Leeper, N.",Adrienne  Mueller,2022-04-27,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundThe main mission of NIH-sponsored institutional training programs such as the T32 is to provide strong research and career training for early career scientists, while preparing those individuals to become leaders working to meet the health-related research needs of the nation. One of the main avenues to pursue health-related research is becoming research faculty at an academic institution. It is therefore important to know whether these programs are succeeding in this mission, or, if barriers exist that prevent trainees from pursuing these careers.

MethodsOur institution currently trains ~ 2400 post-doctoral scholars per year, approximately 5% of whom are enrolled in one of our 33 T32 programs. In this study, we 1) compare the professional outcomes of T32 trainees with non-T32 trainees at our institution, and 2) survey past and current T32 trainees in a subset of high-performing cardiovascular programs about the barriers and enablers they experienced to pursuing research-oriented careers.

ResultsFormer T32 trainees are significantly more likely to attain appointments as primarily research faculty members, compared to other trainees. Trainees report a perceived lack of stability, the paucity of open positions, and the  publish or perish competitive mentality of academia as their top reasons for abandoning careers in academia. However, they were still more likely to choose research over clinical careers after participating in a dedicated T32 program.

ConclusionsOur results support the conclusion that structured training programs strengthen the pipeline of young scientists pursuing careers in academic research, including those from underrepresented backgrounds. However, T32 postdoctoral researchers are held back from pursuing academic careers by a perceived lack of stability and high competition for faculty positions.

FundingThis research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors."

Using Bayesian hierarchical linear models, we examined students conceptual knowledge as measured by the Introductory Molecular and Cell Biology Assessment. The data came from the LASSO database and included 6,547 students from 87 introductory courses at 11 institutions. The model indicated that students with marginalized identities by race, gender, and class tended to start with lower scores than continuing-generation, White men. We conceptualized these differences as educational debts society owed these students due to racism, sexism, and classism. Instruction added to these educational debts for most marginalized groups, with the largest increases for students with multiple marginalized identities. After instruction, society owed Black and Hispanic, first-generation women an educational debt equal to 60-80% of the average learning in the courses. These courses almost all (85/87) used collaborative learning and half (45/87) supported instruction with learning assistants. While research shows collaborative learning better serves students than lecture-based instruction, these results indicate it does not repay educational debts due to racism, sexism, and classism."

Martin Sheldon,2022-05-06,scientific communication and education,"Presenting information in papers allows readers to see the evidence for the research claims. The amount of information presented to readers is increasing in high impact factor scientific journals. The aim of the present study was to determine whether there was a similar expansion in the amount of information presented to readers in subject-specific journals. We examined 878 research papers that were published in the journals Biology of Reproduction and Reproduction during the first six months of 1989, 1999, 2009, and 2019. Although there were few differences between the journals, we found that between 1989 and 2019 the number of figures increased 1.5-fold, the number of figure panels increased 3.6-fold, and the number of display items increased 5.6-fold. Amongst the display items, the number of images per paper increased 10-fold, and the number of graphs per paper increased 3.7-fold. The median paper in 1989 was 8 pages long, contained 6 tables and/or figures, with 1 image and 4 graphs. In 2019 the median paper was 12 pages long, contained 7 tables and/or figures, with 13 images and 15 graphs. This expansion of information in subject-specific journals implies that authors, reviewers, and editors need to help readers digest complex biological messages without causing information overload.

Lay summaryWe are living in an age of science and information. The amount of information presented in research papers has increased over time in the top science journals. Our research examined whether there has been a similar expansion in information in two influential subject-specific journals. We counted how much information was presented in 878 research papers across a 30-year period in the journals Biology of Reproduction and Reproduction. There were few differences between the two journals. But there was a striking increase in the information presented to readers in 2019 compared with 1989. The typical paper in 1989 was 8 pages long and contained 1 picture and 4 graphs. In 2019 the typical paper was 12 pages long and contained 13 pictures and 15 graphs. This expansion of information means that subject-specific journals must balance the presentation of complex biological messages with the risk of causing information overload."

Here, we describe our experience with the organization of a course in one of the longest-running extended bioinformatics series of work-shops, the Evomics Workshop on Population and Speciation Genomics that takes place biennially in the UNESCO world heritage town of [C]esky Krumlov, Czech Republic. We list the key ingredients that make this workshop successful in our view, and describe the routine for workshop organization that we have optimized over the years. We report the results of a survey conducted among past workshop participants that quantifies measures of effective teaching and provide examples of how the workshop setting has led to the cross-fertilisation of ideas and ultimately scientific progress.

D.",Piul S Rabbani,2022-05-18,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundEarly surgical exposure and research fellowships have been independently shown to influence medical students specialty choice, increase academic productivity, and impact residency match. However, to our knowledge there is no published guidance on the implementation of formal plastic surgery summer research programs for first year medical students. We present our institutional experience developing a plastic surgery summer research program over seven years (2013-2020) in an effort to inform program development at other institutions. We hypothesized that this early, formal exposure could spark interest in pursuing research activities throughout medical school and residency.

MethodsFrom 2013 to 2016, a sole basic science research arm existed. In 2017, a clinical research arm was introduced, with several supplemental activities including structured surgical skills sessions. A formalized selection process was instituted in 2014. Participant feedback was analyzed on a yearly basis. Long-term outcomes included continued research commitment, productivity, and residency match.

ResultsThe applicant pool has reached 96 applicants in 2019, with 85% from outside institutions. Acceptance rate reached 7% in 2020. With adherence to a scoring rubric for applicant evaluation, good to excellent interrater reliability was achieved (ICC = 0.75). Long-term outcomes showed that on average per year, 28% of participants continued departmental research activities and 29% returned for dedicated research. Upon finishing medical school, participants had a mean of 6.9{+/-}4.0 peer-reviewed publications. 62% of participants matched into a surgical residency program, with 54% in integrated plastic surgery.

ConclusionsA research program designed for first year medical students interested in plastic surgery can achieve academic goals. Students are provided with mentorship, networking opportunities, and tools for self-guided learning and career development."
10.1101/2022.05.21.492917,Twitter as a community communication tool for international neuroscience conferences,"Duncan, N. W.; Shean, R.",Niall W Duncan,2022-05-22,scientific communication and education,"Scientific conferences increasingly include online aspects. Some are moving to be entirely virtual while others are adopting hybrid models in which there are both in-person and virtual elements. This development of opportunities for people to attend conferences virtually has the potential to both reduce their environmental impact and to make access to them more equitable. An issue with virtual conference participation that has been raised, however, is that there is a reduction in informal communication between attendees. This is an important deficit as such informal contacts play a significant role in both knowledge transmission and professional network development. One forum where some informal communication around conferences does occur is Twitter, with this being encouraged by some conferences. It is not clear, though, to what extent the informal networks built around this service help reduce the problems of unequal access see with in-person conferences. Focusing on geographical equity, we looked at Twitter usage surrounding four international conferences between 2010 and 2021. It was found that engagement with conference hashtags increased steadily over time, peaking in 2019. Users represented 9% of conference attendees and were primarily located in Europe and North America, communicating primarily in English (97% of tweets). Hub nodes within the interaction network were also primarily located in these regions. East Asia had fewer users than would be expected based on neuroscience publication numbers from that region. What users there were in East Asia were engaged with less than were users in other regions. It was found that the overall interaction network showed a rich-club structure, where users with more connections tend to interact more with others with similar connections. Finally, it was found that users in Europe and North America tend to communicate with other users in their own regions whereas users in the rest of the world direct their interactions out of their region. These results suggest that although conference-related Twitter use has been successful to some degree in opening up access, there are some notable limitations in its usage that may mirror aspects of inequality inherent to in-person conferences. How to build equitable informal communication networks around virtual conferences remains a challenging question that requires further discussion."

During the COVID-19 pandemic, undergraduate researchers at our institution and many others lost their work-study research positions due to interruption of in-person research activities. This imposed a financial burden on the students and eliminated an important learning opportunity. To address these challenges, we created a paid, fully-remote, cohort-based research curriculum in computational protein design. Our curriculum used existing protein design methods as a platform to first educate and train undergraduate students and then to test research hypotheses. In the first phase, students learned computational methods to assess the stability of designed protein assemblies. In the second phase, students used a larger dataset to identify factors that could improve the accuracy of current protein design algorithms. This cohort-based program created valuable new research opportunities for undergraduates at our institute and enhanced the undergraduates feeling of connection with the lab. Students learned transferable and useful skills such as literature review, programming basics, data analysis, hypothesis testing, and scientific communication. Our program provides a model of structured computational research training opportunities for undergraduate researchers in any field for organizations looking to expand educational access.

The resources for carrying out and analyzing microbial evolution experiments have become more accessible. It is now possible to expand these studies beyond the research laboratory and into the classroom. We have developed a series of five connected and standards-aligned yeast evolution laboratory modules, called ""yEvo,"" for high school biology students. The modules have been designed to enable students to take agency in answering open-ended research questions. In Module 1, students evolve the bakers yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to tolerate an over-the-counter antifungal drug, and in subsequent modules, investigate how evolved yeasts adapted to this stressful condition at both the phenotype and genotype levels. Pre- and post-surveys from 72 students at two different schools and one-on-one interviews with students and teachers were used to assess our program goals to iteratively improve these modules over three years. We also measured changes in student conceptions of mutation and evolution, confidence in scientific practices, and interest in STEM and biology careers. Students who participated in our experimental evolution module showed improvements in activity-specific concepts, including the importance of variation in evolution and the random nature of mutation. They additionally reported increased confidence in their ability to design a valid biology experiment. Student experimental data replicated literature findings on mechanisms of clotrimazole resistance and has led to new insights into this phenomenon. This collaborative endeavor will serve as a model for other university researchers and K-16 classrooms interested in engaging in open-ended research questions using yeast as a model system."

B.; Zhao, Y.; Diaz Eaton, C.",Carrie  Diaz Eaton,2022-05-29,scientific communication and education,"In this article, we discuss the use of bipartite network analysis to understand and improve interdisciplinary teaching practice. We theorize mathematics and biology as part of a coevolving mutualistic ecosystem. As part of an interdisciplinary teaching initiative, we inventoried mathematics topics appearing in the marine biology classroom and their associated marine context. We then apply techniques of mutualistic bipartite networks analysis to this system to understand the use of mathematical concepts in a marine biology classroom. By analyzing the frequency and distribution of mathematics topics, we see that a variety of mathematical concepts are used across the course with most appearing only a few times. While this is an inherent trait of mutualistic coevolutionary networks, it can create a logistical challenge to supporting mathematics in the marine biology classroom. We find that marine biology topics containing the most mathematics are either close to the instructors research area or were introduced through externally developed educational resources. Finally, we analyze groups of topics that appear connected to each other more frequently to inform both interdisciplinary education development as well as disciplinary support. We also suggest ways to use network metrics to track interdisciplinary connections over time, helping us understand the impact of interventions on interdisciplinary teaching practice."

Design/methodology/approachThe data presented here is the portion relevant to COVID-19 collected in a survey of faculty job applicants at the end of the 2019-2020 job cycle in North America (spring 2020). An additional ""mid-pandemic"" survey was used in fall 2020 for applicants participating in the following job search cycle to inquire about how they were adapting their application materials. A portion of data from the 2020-2022 job cycle surveys was used to represent the ""late-pandemic"". Job posting data from the Higher Education Recruitment Consortium (HERC) is also used to study job availability.

FindingsExamination of faculty job postings from 2018 through 2022 found that while they decreased in 2020, the market recovered in 2021 and beyond. While the market recovered, approximately 10% of the faculty job offers reported by 2019-20 survey respondents were rescinded. Respondents also reported altering their application documents in response to the pandemic as well as delaying or even abandoning their faculty job search.

OriginalityThis paper provides a longitudinal perspective with quantitative data on how the academic job market changed through the major events of the COVID-19 pandemic in North America, a subject of intense discussion and stress, particularly amongst early career researchers."

In this context, correcting the research record, including retractions, has gained attention and space in the publication system. One question is the possible influence of retractions on the careers of scientists. It might be assessed, for example, through citation patterns or productivity rates for authors who have had one or more retractions. This is an emerging issue today, with growing discussions in the research community about impact. We have explored the influence of retractions on grant review criteria. Here, we present results of a qualitative study exploring the views of a group of six representatives of funding agencies from different countries and of a follow-up survey of 224 reviewers in the US. These reviewers have served on panels for the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, and/or a few other agencies. We collected their perceptions about the influence of self-correction of the literature and of retractions on grant decisions. Our results suggest that correcting the research record, for honest error or misconduct, is perceived as an important mechanism to strengthen the reliability of science, among most respondents. However, retractions and self-correcting the literature at large are not factors influencing grant review, and dealing with retractions in reviewing grants is an open question for funders."

In scientific conflicts, it can be difficult for outsiders to know whose evidence or interpretation to trust. In-text citation error rate can assist decision- and policy-making bodies, as well as the courts when conflicts reach the judicial branch of government, by quantifying absolute and relative accuracy of scientists presenting scientific evidence. I propose the use of in-text citation error rates as a scientometric tool to quantify the accuracy of an authors work. In-text citation error rates in excess of an established overall mean (e.g., 11% for minor errors and 7% for major errors in ecology), or differences in in-text citation error rates between opposing groups of scientists could be used to reveal excessive inaccuracies in an author or group. The spotted owl (Strix occidentalis) has been at the center of a multi-decadal conflict caused by competition among people over forest resources, with scientific experts representing opposing stakeholders often presenting conflicting evidence. I applied the in-text citation error rate tool to important papers in the spotted owl and forest fire debate and found evidence of greater error rates in works on one side of this debate. In-text citation error rate can be an effective tool for quantifying accuracy among scientists."

Training of doctoral students primarily occurs at institutions of higher education and these trainees comprise an important part of the workforce at these institutions. Federal investment in the support of doctoral students in the biological and biomedical sciences is distributed differently than the distribution of students across different types of institutions, e.g. Public vs Private. Institutions in states that historically receive less federal support for research also receive less support for doctoral student training. Analysis of F31 awardees at different types of institution reveal little difference in research productivity and subsequent receipt of additional NIH awards. Analysis of a large cohort of doctoral students at different types of institutions also reveal little difference in research productivity, with the exception of citations. Thus, training outcomes, which are related to the quality of the student and training environment, are similar across different institutions. Factors that correlate with F31 funding include R01 funding levels and program size. The findings suggest strategies for institutions to increase success at securing F31s and modification of policy to promote more equitable distribution of F31s across institutions."

This novel biological area is considered of extreme relevance for the development of solutions to global problems. However, its teaching is often inaccessible to students, since many educational resources and methodological procedures are not available for understanding of complex molecular processes. On the other hand, digital fabrication tools, which allow the creation of 3D objects, are increasingly used for educational purposes, and several computational structures of molecular components commonly used in synthetic biology processes are deposited in open databases. Therefore, we hypothesize that the creation of biomolecular structures models by handling 3D physical objects using computer-assisted design (CAD) and additive fabrication based on 3D printing could help professors in synthetic biology teaching. In this sense, the present work describes the design and 3D print of the molecular models of the first synthetic genetic circuit, the toggle switch, which can be freely downloaded and used by teachers to facilitate the training of STEM students in synthetic biology."

Informed by ethnographic research with Indian farmers, veterinarians, and poultry industry representatives, we evidence that both precipitation and vapour pressure are key climate variables that relate to outbreaks of haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS), anthrax (AX), and black quarter (BQ) across the Indian state of Karnataka. We also identify temperature and maximum temperature to be negatively correlated with the same diseases, indicating that a cooling (but still hot) climate with wetter, humid conditions is a prime risk factor for future outbreaks. Principal component analyses have revealed the SW India monsoon and winter periods to be the most strongly correlated with HS, AX and BQ outbreaks. We identify vapour pressure, a proxy for humidity, as having a positive relationship with these specific livestock diseases. The negative relationship between temperature and these diseases, combined with the positive correlation with rainfall and humidity, allow us to classify climate-associated risk using a combination of gridded meteorological time series and epidemiological outbreak data covering the same region and timespan of 1987-2020.

Risk maps were constructed following concerns over the growing impact of climate pressures raised by farmers during ethnographic study. Informed by their insights, we used current climate data and future climate projections as a risk classification tool to assess how disease risk varies in Karnataka in the present and possible future scenarios. Despite a relatively limited epidemiological dataset, clear relationships between precipitation, vapour pressure, and temperature with HS, AX and BQ, along with outbreak high-risk zones were defined. This methodology can be replicated to investigate other diseases (including in humans and plants) and other regions, irrespective of scale, as long as the climate and epidemiological data cover similar time periods. This evidence highlights the need for greater consideration of climate change in One Health research and policy and puts forward a case for, we argue, greater alignment between UNFCCC and One Health policy, for example, within the Tripartite Agreement (between OIE, FOA and WHO) on antimicrobial resistance as disease risk cannot be considered independent of climate change.

One Health Impact StatementThis research aims to investigate the relationship between factors related to climate (surface temperatures, rainfall, humidity) and outbreaks of livestock-related bacterial diseases. This is especially relevant to the One Health approach as it attempts to integrate findings between not only the science of disease but also the science of climate change as a driver of disease, and address problems that could arise within the public and private sectors (local farming, livestock health, government policy etc.). Providing spatial context to climate-associated disease risk across the Indian state of Karnataka will benefit local farmers that may already be, or transitioning to, more intensive livestock farming along with policy makers and private sector companies who are planning for future investments. This transdisciplinary approach springboards from ethnographic observations of famers lived experiences of challenges to their livelihoods and facilitates the use of climate datasets that may not have been primarily collected for or used by disease-related studies to map long-term epidemiological risk. This demonstrates the pragmatic impact that such transdisciplinary projects can have by providing interpretations of observed risks to animal health (highlighted by social scientists during engagement with practitioner communities) that Earth Scientists were then able to quantify, proving links that would be otherwise not have been evidenced. Using disease data sourced from local institutions, including Government of India facilitates as well academic research laboratories, can plan the application of pragmatic solutions to local farmers who are primarily impacted by the findings of the research."

O.; Nwankwo, J. C.; Owojuyigbe, A. M.; Aaron, O. I.; Okonji, A. M.",Marufat Oluyemisi Odetunde,2022-06-15,scientific communication and education,"IntroductionPalliative care demands a special skill from health care providers which begins with the right attitude and adequate knowledge during training. Little is known about knowledge and attitude of physiotherapy undergraduates towards palliative care. Objective of this study was to assess knowledge and attitude of clinical undergraduates of physiotherapy in Nigerian universities towards palliative care.

MethodThis was a cross sectional survey involving 281 (132 females and 149 males) clinical physiotherapy undergraduates from 10 purposively selected universities across Nigeria. Palliative care knowledge was assessed with a structured questionnaire while attitude was assessed using FROMMELT attitude towards care of the dying scale. Both questionnaires were administered online via Google forms. Socio-demographic data of each respondent was also collected. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Level of significance was set at p<0.05.

ResultsMajority of respondents were males (53%) aged 21-25 years (87.9%) from Obafemi Awolowo University (40.3%) and had above average knowledge (62%). Almost all, (99.6%) of the respondents displayed favourable attitude. There were significant associations between knowledge and university of respondents (p=0.001), attitude and age of respondents (p=0.003), as well as attitude and geopolitical zone of origin of respondents (p=0.006). There was significant correlation between knowledge and attitude of respondents (r =0.441, p =0.001).

ConclusionThere are knowledge gaps, but positive attitudes towards palliative care among clinical physiotherapy undergraduates in Nigeria. This signifies an essential and urgent need for inclusion, reform or improvement in palliative care education in the curriculum of undergraduate physiotherapy training in Nigerian universities."

T.; Odole, A. C.; Mbada, C. E.; Komolafe, M. A.",Marufat Oluyemisi Odetunde,2022-06-15,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundInterventions based on social cognitive theory are more patient-centered and focused on principles that can enlighten and encourage adoption of healthy habits. Addressing limited stroke literacy among stroke survivors based on social cognitive theory is an effective means to reduce secondary stroke risk. The use of trending Mobile Health (m-health) devices can be a valuable interventional approach to achieve this through improved stroke literacy.

ObjectivesThe objectives of this study were to develop and test effectiveness of m-health based educational package for stroke prevention among stroke survivors.

MethodThis was a multimodal methodology involving content development and effectiveness testing using Delphi protocol and pretest-posttest design respectively. Development involved items selection, rating and retention; script writing, translation and recording into an audio and video educational packages. Effectiveness testing involved 30 consenting, consecutively assigned SSVs in each of audio (AIG) and video (VIG) intervention group. Stroke literacy was assessed at baseline, 2nd and 4th week post-intervention. Participants socio-demographic data were also collected. Data was summarized using descriptive and inferential statistics. Alpha value was set at p<0.05.

ResultsMajority of the participants were male (63.3%), over 60 years old (51.7%), hypertensive (83.3%) and had tertiary education (31.7%). Knowledge of stroke risk factors improved between AIG and VIG from baseline (11 23{+/-}4 01 and 10.07{+/-}3.24) to 2nd week (17 73{+/-}0.78 and 15.30{+/-}1.78) and 4th week (17.97{+/-}0.18 and 16.77{+/-}1.01) post-intervention respectively. There were significant differences between the two groups (p<0.01).

ConclusionMobile-health education based on social cognitive theory effectively improves stroke literacy among SSVs and should be tested among larger samples in the community."

An especially harmful one of these unethical practices is the formation of publication cartels, where authors offer gift authorship to each other reciprocally. Here, by developing a simple model and a simulation of the publication process I investigate how beneficial cartels can be and what measure can be used to restrict them. My results indicate that publication cartels can significantly boost members productivity even if paper counts are weighted by the inverse of author number (the 1/n rule). Nevertheless, applying the 1/n rule generates conflicts of interest both among cartel members themselves and between members and non-members which might lead to the self-purification of the academic publishing industry."

C.; Coates, K.; Hubbard, K.",Dominic  Charles  Henri,2022-06-24,scientific communication and education,"The lack of diversity in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) is a significant issue for the sector. Many organisations and educators have identified lack of representation of historically marginalised groups within teaching materials as a potential barrier to students feeling that a STEM career is something that they can aspire to. A key barrier to addressing the issue is providing accessible and effective evidence-based approaches for educators to implement. In this study, we explore the potential for adapting presentation slides within lectures to  humanise the scientists involved, presenting their full names and photographs alongside a Harvard style reference. We adopt a questionnaire based methodology, and survey 161 undergraduates and postgraduates at a UK civic university. We first establish that students project implicit biases onto a hypothetical reference, with over 50% of students assuming the scientist was male and Western. We then explore what students think of the  humanised slide design, concluding that most students see it as good pedagogical practice, with some students positively changing their perceptions about diversity in science. We were unable to compare responses by ethnicity, but find evidence that female and non-binary students are more likely to see this as good pedagogical practice, perhaps reflecting white male fragility in being exposed to initiatives designed to highlight diversity. We conclude that humanised powerpoint slides are a potentially effective tool to highlight diversity of scientists within existing research-led teaching, but highlight that this is only a small intervention that needs to sit alongside more substantive work to address the lack of diversity in STEM."

S.",Casey S Greene,2022-06-28,scientific communication and education,"While we often think of words as having a fixed meaning that we use to describe a changing world, words are also dynamic and changing. Scientific research can also be remarkably fast-moving, with new concepts or approaches rapidly gaining mind share. We examined scientific writing, both preprint and pre-publication peer-reviewed text, to identify terms that have changed and examine their use. One particular challenge that we faced was that the shift from closed to open access publishing meant that the size of available corpora changed by over an order of magnitude in the last two decades. We developed an approach to evaluate semantic shift by accounting for both intra- and inter-year variability using multiple integrated models. Using this strategy and examining year-by-year changes revealed thousands of change points in both corpora. We found change points for tokens including  cas9,  pandemic, and  sars among many others. The consistent change-points between pre-publication peer-reviewed and preprinted text were largely related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We developed a web app for exploration (https://greenelab.github.io/word-lapse/) that enables users to investigate individual terms. To our knowledge, this analysis is the first to examine semantic shift in biomedical preprints and pre-publication peer-reviewed text, and it lays the foundation for future work to examine how terms acquire new meaning and the extent to which that process is encouraged or discouraged by peer review."

S.",Karishma Surendra Kaushik,2022-06-29,scientific communication and education,"It is increasingly recognized that microbes, such as bacteria, exist in communities or biofilms, both in the environment and human body. However, school biology curriculum continues to focus on the free-floating form of bacterial life, with minimal descriptions of biofilms. Consequently, there is a need to introduce biofilms to school students, to not only to develop a fundamental understanding of microbial life, but to also highlight the challenges posed by biofilm infections to antibiotic treatment. We have developed a hands-on activity in which students build a biofilm model, and use it to understand the role of the extracellular matrix in the antibiotic tolerance of biofilms. The activity uses simple, easy to obtain supplies, and can be conducted in an in-person or virtual format, with students participating from school or home. We conducted the activity in virtual mode for a group of 59 school students across India, and present feedback and learnings that could be used to execute and adapt this accessible and engaging science experience."

The unexpected shift of our gene expression laboratory course to a remote model provided the opportunity to assess how student learning of these skills and concepts would be affected in an entirely online environment. Our data suggest the reduced learning gains for skill-based techniques came with increased student learning of concepts and analysis, which may have aided stimulating student interest in gene expression studies."

Ian Hutchins,2022-07-07,scientific communication and education,"Insights from biomedical citation networks can be used to identify promising avenues for accelerating research and its downstream bench-to-bedside translation. Citation analysis generally assumes that each citation documents causal knowledge transfer that informed the conception, design, or execution of the main experiments. Citations may exist for other reasons. In this paper we identify a subset of citations that are unlikely to represent causal knowledge flow. Using a large, comprehensive feature set of open access data, we train a predictive model to identify such citations. The model relies only on the title, abstract, and reference set and not the full-text or future citations patterns, making it suitable for publications as soon as they are released, or those behind a paywall (the vast majority). We find that the model identifies, with high prediction scores, citations that were likely added during the peer review process, and conversely identifies with low prediction scores citations that are known to represent causal knowledge transfer. Using the model, we find that federally funded biomedical research publications represent 30% of the estimated causal knowledge transfer from basic studies to clinical research, even though these comprise only 10% of the literature, a three-fold overrepresentation in this important type of knowledge transfer. This finding underscores the importance of federal funding as a policy lever to improve human health.

Significance statementCitation networks document knowledge flow across the literature, and insights from these networks are increasingly used to form science policy decisions. However, many citations are known to be not causally related to the inception, design, and execution of the citing study. This adds noise to the insights derived from these networks. Here, we show that it is possible to train a machine learning model to identify such citations, and that the model learns to identify known causal citations as well. We use this model to show that government funding drives a disproportionate amount of causal knowledge transfer from basic to clinical research. This result highlights a straightforward policy lever for accelerating improvements to human health: federal funding."

R.; Hines, J. H.",Jacob H Hines,2022-07-07,scientific communication and education,"Much of our understanding of cell and tissue development, structure, and function stems from fluorescence microscopy. The acquisition of colorful and glowing images engages and excites users ranging from seasoned microscopists to STEM students. Fluorescence microscopes range in cost from several thousand to several hundred thousand US dollars. Therefore, the use of fluorescence microscopy is typically limited to well-funded institutions and biotechnology companies, research core facilities, and medical laboratories, but is financially impractical at many universities and colleges, primary and secondary schools (K-12), and in science outreach settings. In this study, we developed and characterized components that when used in combination with a smartphone or tablet, perform fluorescence microscopy at a cost of less than $50 US dollars per unit. We re-purposed recreational LED flashlights and theater stage lighting filters to enable viewing of green and red fluorophores including EGFP, DsRed, mRFP, and mCherry on a simple-to-build frame made of wood and plexiglass. These devices, which we refer to as glowscopes, were capable of 10 m resolution, imaging fluorescence in live specimens, and were compatible with all smartphone and tablet models we tested. In comparison to scientific-grade fluorescence microscopes, glowscopes may have limitations to sensitivity needed to detect dim fluorescence and the inability to resolve subcellular structures. We demonstrate capability of viewing fluorescence within zebrafish embryos, including heart rate, rhythmicity, and regional anatomy of the central nervous system. Due to the low cost of individual glowscope units, we anticipate this device can help to equip K-12, undergraduate, and science outreach classrooms with fleets of fluorescence microscopes that can engage students with hands-on learning activities."

Insistent petition for institutions to understand their students is about creating equitable opportunities for the diverse student bodies. However, ""at-risk"" students ubiquitously co-exist. This article conducted a scoping review of literature published locally and internationally that sought to understand ""at-risk"" students in higher education. The study examined the aims, participants, variables, data analytics tools, and the methods used when the topic on ""at-risk"" students is studied. Broadly, we sought the bigger picture of what matters, where, when, why, and how so. The Population, Concept, and Context (PCC) framework was considered for demarcating appropriate literature for the concept and context of ""at-risk"" students. The JBI protocol was chosen for selecting relevant literature published between 2010 and 2022, searched from the EBSCOhost and ScienceDirect databases. A search tool was developed using the litsearchr R package and screening proceeded guided by the PRISMA framework. Although 1961 articles were obtained after applying the search criteria, 84 articles satisfied the stipulated inclusion criteria. Although Africa is lagging, research on ""at-risk"" students is exponentially growing in America, Europe, and Asia. Notably, relevant articles use academic data to understand students at risk of dropping-out or failing in the first year. Often, statistical and machine learning methods were preferred. Most factors that determined whether a student is at risk of failing or dropping out were found to be highly correlated with high school knowledge. Also, being ""at-risk"" connoted ones geographical context, ethnicity, gender, and academic culture. It was noted that autonomously motivated students, with good time management, succeed. Ideally, institutions need to identify areas that need intervention, including courses where special tutoring programmes are needed. Institutions should detect staff who need further training. Nonetheless, psychosocial well-being programmes should augment institutional investments to improve students success. Precisely, institutional environments should be stimulating, conducive, and motivating."

Although previous reports have investigated accessible reporting practices that lead to reproducible research in other fields, to date no study has explored the extent of accessible and reproducible research practices in cardiovascular science literature.

MethodsTo study accessibility and reproducibility in cardiovascular research reporting, we screened 400 randomly selected articles published in 2019 in three top cardiovascular science publications: Circulation, the European Heart Journal, and the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (JACC). We screened each paper for accessible and reproducible research practices using a set of accessibility criteria including protocol, materials, data, and analysis script availability, as well as accessibility of the publication itself. We also quantified the consistency of open research practices within and across cardiovascular study types and journal formats.

ResultsWe identified that fewer than 2% of cardiovascular research publications provide sufficient resources (materials, methods, data, and analysis scripts) to fully reproduce their studies. After calculating an accessibility score as a measure of the extent to which an articles makes its resources available, we also showed that the level of accessibility varies across study types (p = 2e-16) and across journals (p = 5.9e-13). We further show that there are significant differences in which study types share which resources. We also describe the relationship between accessibility scores and corresponding author nationality.

ConclusionAlthough the degree to which reproducible reporting practices are present in publications varies significantly across journals and study types; current cardiovascular science reports frequently do not provide sufficient materials, protocols, data, or analysis information to reproduce a study. In the future, having higher standards of accessibility mandated by either journals or funding bodies will help increase the reproducibility of cardiovascular research.

In this document, we present the Minimum Information About Disorder Experiments (MIADE) guidelines to define the minimal fundamental parameters required for non-experts to understand the key findings of an experiment studying intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) or intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs). MIADE guidelines provide recommendations for data producers to describe the results of their experiments at source, for curators to annotate experimental data to community resources and for database developers maintaining community resources to disseminate the data. We give examples of the application of these guidelines in common use cases and describe the implementation of an update to the DisProt IDP database to allow MIADE-compliant annotation. The MIADE guidelines will improve the interpretability of experimental results for data consumers, facilitate direct data submission, simplify data curation, improve data exchange among repositories and standardise the dissemination of the key metadata on an IDP experiment by IDP data sources."

Searches on both bibliographic and organisation databases were conducted in English and were restricted to the period 2010-2019. Search results were screened for relevance at title, abstract and full text level, which identified 716 articles relevant to the research question. The systematic map revealed an increased publication output from 2012-2017, compared to 2010-2011 and 2018-2019. Most studies were conducted in Oromia, Amhara and SNNPR. A substantial body of evidence was found for trypanosomosis, ectoparasite infestation, fasciolosis, nematodiasis, echinococcosis, brucellosis and bovine brucellosis. This study suggests that despite the high output of epidemiological publications, further understanding of a considerable number of diseases is required and where evidence is abundant, synthesis of information should be carried out in order to better inform decisions on disease control priorities in the livestock sector."

Patients outcomes can be influenced by established family practices. As a result, the goal of this study is to determine diabetes FMs knowledge and practices in the areas of nutrition and exercise. On 200 FMs selected via convenient sampling from rural clinics in Senwabarwana, Limpopo Province, a quantitative approach and cross-sectional descriptive design were used. Close-ended questionnaires were used to collect data, which were then analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences Software v27.0 and descriptive and inferential statistical analysis. Only 31% of participants had great overall knowledge, according to the findings, and only 9% had good practice. Over half of the participants (53%) believe that overweight diabetes patients should skip meals in order to lose weight, and 3.5% and 19%, respectively, are familiar with exercise prescriptions and glucose measurements. Only 35,5% of people eat breakfast every day, whereas the overwhelming majority (87,5%) exercise. The findings of this study show that patients FMs need to enhance their diet and exercise diabetes care knowledge and practices.

In this context, a particularly pervasive gender bias is undercitation of publications authored by women, resulting in profound negative effects on academic visibility and career advancement. This bias has been well documented in fields where author gender distributions are strongly skewed towards men (e.g., astronomy, physics, neuroscience). By investigating citation practices in a field that has traditionally been more accessible to female scientists (Speech and Language Pathology, SLP), we demonstrate that gendered citation practices are mediated by author gender distribution, rather than being a universal pattern. Specifically, our results revealed a citation pattern in SLP that (a) overall tends to favor female authors, (b) persists after controlling for potential confounding factors and, (c) is particularly strong when female authors are citing publications involving female first and senior author teams. This research also implies that the implementation of effective measures to increase the number and influence of underrepresented individuals in specific fields of science may be suitable to mitigate downstream disadvantages for career advancement of either sex."

Such consortia are expected to target societal problems, be international, to engage in trans- or interdisciplinary research, to involve stakeholders and have specific plans for implementation. For example, Horizon Europe focuses on five missions that are being targeted by such type of consortia. This, however, does not seem to be the type of funding that active researchers appreciate the most: a recent letter signed by over 24.000 researchers clearly shows their preference for ERC grants. What are the underlying reasons for this difference? Here, we share insights on how natural science and medical researchers experience the impact of these funding schemes using interviews. Our findings highlight that the two different types of funding schemes have a different performative effect on research, and that ERC-type funding aligns most with how scientists think research should best be conducted."

Other recent studies have emphasized the importance of the latter, asking funding experts. Here, I explored how the impact of competitive research funding on science is being perceived by active researchers. More specifically, I have conducted a series of group sessions with researchers in two different countries with a different degree of competition for funding, in three disciplinary fields (medical sciences, natural sciences and the humanities), and with researchers in two different career stages (permanent versus temporary employment). Researchers across all groups experienced that competition for funding shapes science, with many unintended questionable side effects. Intriguingly, these questionable effects had little to do with the type of questionable research practices (QRPs) typically being presented in the research integrity literature. While the notion of QRPs focuses on publications and assumes that there would essentially be a correct way to do the science, researchers worried about the shaping of science via funding. According to my session participants, rather than ending up as really being wrong, this shaping could result in predictable, fashionable, short-sighted, and overpromising science. And still, this was seen as highly problematic: scientists experienced that the  projectification of science makes it more and more difficult to do any science of real importance: plunging into the unknown or addressing big issues that would need a long-term horizon to mature."

The 151 respondents unanimously agreed on the need to train the next generation of OoC researchers and that the training should be provided early, in interdisciplinary subjects and throughout the researchers career. We identified two key training priorities: (i) training scientists with a biology background in microfabrication and microfluidics principles and (ii) training OoC developers in pharmacology/toxicology. This makes training in OoC a transdisciplinary challenge rather than an interdisciplinary one. The data acquired and analyzed here serves to guide training initiatives for preparing competent and transdisciplinary researchers, capable of assuring the successful development and application of OoC technologies in academic research, pharmaceutical/chemical/cosmetic industries, personalized medicine and clinical trials on chip."

Mostajo-Radji,2022-08-11,scientific communication and education,"Project-based learning (PBL) has long been recognized as an effective way to teach complex biology concepts. However, not all institutions have the resources to facilitate effective project-based coursework for students. We have developed a framework for facilitating PBL using remote-controlled internet-connected microscopes. Through this approach, one lab facility can host an experiment allowing simultaneous interaction by many students worldwide. Experiments on this platform can be run on long timescales and with materials that are typically unavailable to high school classrooms. This allows students to perform novel research projects rather than just repeat standard classroom experiments. To investigate the impact of this program, we designed and ran six user studies with students worldwide. All experiments were executed in Santa Cruz and San Francisco, California, with observations and decisions made remotely by the students using their personal computers and cellphones. In surveys gathered after the experiments conclusion, students reported increased excitement for science and a greater desire to pursue a career in STEM. This framework represents a novel, scalable, and effective PBL approach that has the potential to democratize biology and STEM education around the world."

Two common types are Amoebic liver abscesses (ALA), caused by protozoa called entamoeba histolytica while several pus-forming bacteria cause pyogenic liver abscesses (PLA). Both cause debilitating morbidities and are diagnosed by pus culture-sensitivity tests. A contrast CT abdomen shows well-demarcated lesions in the liver. The telemedicine practice is on the rise where image processing is becoming a part and parcel of teleradiology to fill the gap between the number of radiologists versus the large patient pool. Cluster-based image segmentation is a useful step in grouping the image into the desired number of clusters. The k-means clustering (k-MC) technique is one popular method, used in this study on ALA and PLA contrast CT images. it observes that with the desired 2-clusters - a) normal liver tissue and b) the pus-filled tissue) parameters, the algorithm gives better results in PLA."

Buzbas,2022-08-12,scientific communication and education,"The scientific reform movement has proposed openness as a potential remedy to the putative reproducibility or replication crisis. However, the conceptual relationship between openness, replication experiments, and results reproducibility has been obscure. We analyze the logical structure of experiments, define the mathematical notion of idealized experiment, and use this notion to advance a theory of reproducibility. Idealized experiments clearly delineate the concepts of replication and results reproducibility, and capture key differences with precision, allowing us to study the relationship among them. We show how results reproducibility varies as a function of: the elements of an idealized experiment, the true data generating mechanism, and the closeness of the replication experiment to an original experiment. We clarify how openness of experiments is related to designing informative replication experiments and to obtaining reproducible results. With formal backing and evidence, we argue that the current ""crisis"" reflects inadequate attention to a theoretical understanding of results reproducibility."

The authors identified that the scientists shared a basic understanding of media logic classified in three patterns. Two patterns were previously identified by Olesk: 1) adaption (ability to explain research in a simple, engaging fashion but with a reactive approach to journalist interaction) and 2) adoption (proactively create and manage media interactions for strategic aims through a more active use of media logic). The other emerged as a new, third pattern, affiliation (enthusiastic contributors to journalists production practices and desire to engage in public outreach)."

F.",Aaron S Fox,2022-08-14,scientific communication and education,"A common approach in biomechanical analysis of running technique is to average data from several gait cycles to compute a  representative mean. However, the impact of the quantity and selection of gait cycles on biomechanical measures is not well understood. We examined the effects of gait cycle selection on kinematic data by: (i) comparing representative means calculated from varying numbers of gait cycles to  global means from the entire capture period; and (ii) comparing representative means from varying numbers of gait cycles sampled from different parts of the capture period. We used a public dataset (n = 28) of lower limb kinematics captured during a 30-second period of treadmill running at three speeds (2.5m {middle dot} s-1, 3.5m {middle dot} s-1 and 4.5m {middle dot} s-1).  Ground truth values were determined by averaging data across all collected strides and compared to representative means calculated from random samples (1,000 samples) of n (range = 5--30) consecutive gait cycles. We also compared representative means calculated from n (range = 5--15) consecutive gait cycles randomly sampled (1,000 samples) from within the same data capture period. The mean, variance and range of the absolute error of the representative mean compared to the  ground truth mean progressively reduced across all speeds as the number of gait cycles used increased. Similar magnitudes of  error were observed between the 2.5m {middle dot} s-1 and 3.5m {middle dot} s-1 speeds at comparable gait cycle numbers -- where the maximum errors were < 1.5 degrees even with a small number of gait cycles (i.e. 5-10). At the 4.5m {middle dot} s-1 speed, maximum errors typically exceeded 2-4 degrees when a lower number of gait cycles were used. Subsequently, a higher number of gait cycles (i.e. 25-30) was required to achieve low errors (i.e. 1-2 degrees) at the 4.5m {middle dot} s-1 speed. The mean, variance and range of absolute error of representative means calculated from different parts of the capture period was consistent irrespective of the number of gait cycles used. The error between representative means was low (i.e. <1.5 degrees) and consistent across the different number of gait cycles at the 2.5m {middle dot} s-1 and 3.5m {middle dot} s-1 speeds, and consistent but larger (i.e. up to 2-4 degrees) at the 4.5m {middle dot} s-1 speed. Our findings suggest that selecting as many gait cycles as possible from a treadmill running bout will minimise potential  error. Analysing a small sample (i.e. 5-10 cycles) will typically result in minimal  error (i.e. < 2 degrees), particularly at lower speeds (i.e. 2.5m {middle dot} s-1 and 3.5m {middle dot} s-1). Researchers and clinicians should consider the balance between practicalities of collecting and analysing a smaller number of gait cycles against the potential  error when determining their methodological approach. Irrespective of the number of gait cycles used, we recommend that the potential  error introduced by the choice of gait cycle number be considered when interpreting the magnitude of effects in treadmill-based running studies."

MethodsA total of 43 residents who participated in the Flipped Teaching based on Video Conference in April and June were included as the research objects. Online examination was conducted for these residents, and the demographic characteristics of these residents and their examination score were quantitatively analyzed, so as to clarify the correlation between the demographic characteristics of these residents and their examination score.

ResultsThe average score of 43 residents in the online examination was 72.0(64.0-79.0). 40 residents passed the exam, accounting for 93.0%. The bivariate correlations analysis showed that the age, gender, educational background, training batch and training phase of residents were not correlated with the examination score; all P > 0.05. The age, gender, educational background, training batch and training phase of these residents were not correlated with the examination score by single linear regression and multiple linear regression analysis; all P > 0.05.

ConclusionAge, gender, educational background, training batches and training phases of internal medicine residents are not related to the examination score after Flipped Teaching based on Video Conference. Demographic characteristics may not be related to the training effect of residents through preliminary study."

H.",James H Nurse,2022-08-16,scientific communication and education,"BACKGROUNDThe social media site Twitter has been widely embraced in medical circles for its ability to connect individuals and support rapid information sharing. Critics say that the messages shared may not accurately reflect what was said and that sharing meeting content could devalue conferences themselves. It is unclear how it is used at SSIEM and what value it may bring.

METHODSTwitters tweetdeck software was used to find all tweets containing the conference  hashtag #SSIEM2018. All tweets were reviewed to identify the author, see what had been shared and count replies, likes and retweets. Authors were grouped by professional background and tweet content was broken down by type of material shared and theme.

RESULTS122 relevant tweets were sent during the fortnight at the beginning of September 2018, creating over 400,000 impressions. There were a further 73 replies with approximately 13 engagements (likes, replies or retweets) per tweet. 36 people wrote tweets (rate: 3.4 per person [1-33]). One quarter of the tweets shared poster content and over one third of tweets related to Phenylketonuria materials. 50 of the tweets were produced by just two accounts, both intended to provide information to patients and their families.

DISCUSSIONTweets where no hashtag was used cannot be identified and restrictions within Twitter prevent certain analyses on tweet data greater than 30 days old. However, Twitter uptake within metabolic medicine is significantly behind other specialities where conference tweets can exceed 20,000. Information shared is typically intended for patients rather than other health professionals; this suggests a different uptake to more mainstream specialities. Presenting teams should be aware that their work may be received directly by patients and families and consider how best to present their messages for all who may receive them."

Marcus Lambert,2022-08-23,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundStructural mentoring barriers are policies, practices, and cultural norms that collectively disadvantage marginalized groups and perpetuate disparities in mentoring. While these mentoring barriers can be found early in the training pathway, failure to address or overcome these barriers at the postdoctoral training stage has a direct impact on faculty diversity and national efforts to retain underrepresented groups in research careers.

MethodsTo better understand the mentoring barriers faced by postdoctoral trainees, and possible ways to address them, a diverse sample of postdoctoral scholars (""postdocs"") from across the United States were asked to participate in focus groups to discuss their training experiences. We conducted five 90-minute focus groups with 32 biomedical postdocs, including 20 (63%) women and 15 (47%) individuals from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups (URG). Participants were well-represented across years of training, and 65% were at least somewhat likely to pursue a research-intensive faculty career, similar to previously reported national averages.

ResultsA social ecological framework was used to examine both the upstream and downstream manifestations of structural mentoring barriers, as well as mentor barriers, overall. Themes were categorized on four broad levels: Individual (attitudes, beliefs, knowledge, or behaviors that inform mentoring barriers), Interpersonal (mentoring barriers arising from dyadic, peer, or network relationships), Institutional (departmental, institutional, organizational mentoring barriers), or Systemic (mentoring barriers originating from policies or broad social and cultural norms). Notable structural barriers included (1) academic politics and scientific hierarchy, (2) inequalities resulting from mentor prestige, (3) the (over) reliance on one mentor, (4) the lack of formal training for academic and non-academic careers, and (5) the lack of institutional diversity and institutional mentor training. These structural barriers foster mentoring practices and behaviors that lead to poor work-life balance, poor communication, and research career attrition. To overcome these barriers, postdocs strongly encouraged developing a network or team of mentors and recommended institutional interventions that create more comprehensive professional development, mentorship, and belonging.

ConclusionsFor postdoctoral scientists, structural mentoring barriers can permeate down to institutional, interpersonal, and individual levels, impeding a successful transition to an independent research career. It has become clear that large-scale changes in mentoring must come from addressing the policies, practices, and cultural norms that perpetuate poor mentoring. This work provides strong evidence for promoting mentorship networks and cultivating a ""mentoring milieu"" that fosters a supportive community and a strong culture of mentorship at all levels."

There are various developmental trajectories of overweight/obesity in adulthood. It is unclear how the intergenerational mobility of socioeconomic status influences adult overweight/obesity in China.

MethodsWe used longitudinal data from ten waves of the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) between 1989 and 2015 for our analysis. The group-based trajectory modeling was used to identify BMI trajectories in adulthood. Multinomial logistic regression was adopted to assess the associations between SES and adult BMI trajectories.

ResultsAmong a total of 3,138 participants, three latent clusters, including normal-stable BMI (51.4%), progressive overweight group (39.8%), and progressive obesity group (8.8%), were identified. High fathers occupational position, high participants occupation position and educational attainment, respectively, were associated with greater obesity risk. Compared to a stable low life course SES trajectory, a stable high life course SES trajectory was associated with a 2.35-fold risk of obesity, and upward and downward social mobility trajectories increased the risk for overweight/obesity. Individuals in the highest relative to the lowest life course cumulative socioeconomic score group had around twice risk of obesity.

ConclusionsThe results emphasize the role of the high SES in early life and life-course SES accumulation, in the obesity intervention in China.

However, discrete data regarding the use/misuse of antimicrobials at pharmacies in LMICs are limited. This study was conducted to understand the knowledge, attitude, and practice of pharmacy employees on antimicrobial dispensing in Nepal.

MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional survey using a structured questionnaire on 801 pharmacy employees working in community and hospital pharmacies located in Lalitpur metropolitan city (LMC) of Kathmandu, Nepal between April 2017 and March 2019.

ResultsNot all respondents replied to all questions asked. A majority (92%, 738/801) of respondents agreed that the demand for non-prescription antimicrobials was common. Sixty nine percent (437/635) of participants responded that they would ask of prescription before dispensing. Suspected respiratory tract infection was the most common reason demanding for non-prescription antimicrobials, identified by 68% (535/792) of respondents. Azithromycin was the most commonly prescribed and sold antimicrobials, as reported by 46%, (361/787) and 48% (377/779) of participants respectively. A majority (87%; 696/800) of respondents agreed on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to be a global public health threat; 54% (429/796) perceived antimicrobial misuse to be an important driver of AMR, while only 39% (315/801) replied that judicious dispensing of antimicrobials can help curb AMR.

ConclusionOur study revealed that the unfounded dispensing and use of antimicrobials is prevalent among pharmacies in Kathmandu, Nepal. This overreliance on antimicrobials, notably azithromycin, may escalated the burden of AMR. We identified several drivers of inappropriate antimicrobial dispensing practice in pharmacies, which will aid public health authorities in addressing these issues. Further studies considering the role of other stakeholders, such as physicians, veterinarians, general public, and policy makers are required to obtain a more holistic perspectives on the practices of antimicrobial use so to curb the extant AMR crisis."

Analyzing assessment data comprises multiple steps and statistical techniques that consume much of researchers time and are error-prone. While education research continues to grow across many disciplines of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), the DBER community lacks tools to streamline education research data analysis. DBERlibR--an R package to streamline and automate DBER data processing and analysis--fills this gap. The package reads user-provided assessment data, cleans them, merges multiple datasets (as necessary), checks assumption(s) for specific statistical techniques (as necessary), applies various statistical tests (e.g., one-way analysis of covariance, one-way repeated-measures analysis of variance), and presents and interprets the results all at once. By providing the most frequently used analytic techniques, this package will contribute to DBER by facilitating the creation and widespread use of evidence-based knowledge and practices. The outputs contain a sample interpretation of the results for users convenience. User inputs are minimal; they only need to prepare the data files as instructed and type a function in RStudio to conduct a specific data analysis."

To determine how prepared people are to use this knowledge to make critical health-related decisions, we assessed the publics level of genomic literacy and whether this knowledge affects their engagement in behaviors related to genomics, such as getting genetic testing.

MethodsA survey assessing perceived and actual knowledge, attitudes, concerns, sources of information, and behaviors related to genomics was administered to national and regional samples of participants. A hierarchical linear regression tested whether knowledge and attitudes predicted engagement in behaviors related to genomics.

ResultsParticipants had good basic knowledge of genetics, though they were less familiar with the term ""the human genome."" They also displayed positive attitudes towards genomic research, despite expressing many concerns. Both greater knowledge and more positive attitudes significantly and independently predicted greater engagement in genetic testing and other related proactive health behaviors.

ConclusionKnowledge and concerns about genomics impact the publics ability and willingness to obtain genetic testing and engage in other proactive health behaviors. The publics genomic literacy could be enhanced by integrating their knowledge (e.g of DNA) with broader concepts (e.g. the human genome and genomics) and how they relate to health. Future research is needed on interventions that do this, to improve the publics genomic literacy through relationships that build trust"

Due to the recent uptake of CROTs - the CRediT taxonomy in particular- researchers from different disciplinary backgrounds have anticipated a positive impact on ethical issues related to the attribution of credit and responsibilities. Yet, they have also voiced concerns about CROTs shortcomings and ways in which they could be misunderstood or misused and have provided suggestions to improve them. These discussions have never been collated and consolidated. To fill this gap, the current scoping review collates and explores published viewpoints about the ethics of CROTs. Ovid Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched. In total, 30 papers met the inclusion criteria and were subsequently analyzed using an inductive approach. We identified eight themes and 20 specific issues related to the ethics of CROTs and provided four recommendations for CROT developers: 1) Compile comprehensive instructions that explain how CROTs should be used and that note common pitfalls of employing them in practice; 2) Improve the coherence of used terms, 3) Provide translations of roles in languages other than English, and 4) Communicate a clear vision about future development plans."

M.",Wayne Marcus Getz,2022-09-02,scientific communication and education,"We introduce an extension to Conways Game of Life (GoL) that allows more than 2 states (dead/alive; 0/1) to be specified. State 0 is reserved for dead or lifeless cells, and states 1 to n - 1 for cells that are ""alive."" Associated with state{sigma} is the value v{sigma} of cells such that v0 = 0, v1 = 1, and for{sigma} = 2, ..., n - 1 the cell value v{sigma} is free to be assigned any positive integer value. The value Vij of the Moore neighborhood surrounding cells at array locations (i, j) (i = 1, ..., r rows, j = 1, ..., c) is the sum of state values of the 8 cells that touch the cell at location (i, j) (4 north, south, east and west side cells and 4 NE, NW, SE, and SW corner cells; except for boundary cells, which have 5 neighbors on an edge or 3 neighbors on a corner, and noting that torroidal arrays have no boundaries). The game is based on a set of rules involving the values Vij that determine whether cells at locations (i, j) in state{sigma} , stay in this state or progress to state{sigma} + 1,{sigma} = 0, ..., n - 2, or die (remain dead in the case of dead cells). Specifically, for two non-negative constants 0 [&le;] p{sigma}L [&le;] p{sigma}U, if Vij < p{sigma}L, Vij [isin] [p{sigma}L, p{sigma}U] or Vij > p{sigma}U then a cell in state{sigma} at location (i, j) respectively stays in state{sigma} , progresses to state{sigma} + 1, or dies. In this paper, we illustrate some of the properties of such games of life with three, four and six states, identifying still-life, oscillator, glider and replicator pattern sequences. We also examine the long term behavior of patterns arising from random and regular (stripped diagonals) starting configurations, as well as set-piece motifs. Most importantly, we introduce two freely downloadable, Numerus runtime alterable model platforms (Numerus RAMPs) that can be used to simulate the three and four state GoLs discussed in this paper, and provide a guide on how these RAMPs can be used to explore the behavior of our GoLs."

Chundawat,2022-09-03,scientific communication and education,"The analysis of particles bound to a surface by flexible tethers can facilitate understanding of various biophysical phenomena (e.g., molecular dynamics of DNA-protein or protein-ligand binding interactions, DNA extensibility and polymer biophysics). Being able to model such systems theoretically can aid in understanding experimentally observed motions and furthermore the limitations of such models can provide insight into modeling complex systems that basic theory sometimes cannot account for. The simulation of tethered particle motion (TPM) allows for efficient analysis of complex behaviors exhibited by such systems, however this type of experiment is rarely taught in undergraduate science classes. We have developed a MATLAB simulation package intended to be used in academic contexts to concisely model and graphically represent the behavior of different tether-particle systems. We show how analysis of the simulation results can be used in biophysical research employing single molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS). Here, our simulation package is capable of modeling any given particle-tether-substrate system and allows the user to generate a parameter space with static and dynamic model components. Our simulation was successfully able to recreate generally observed experimental trends using a recently developed SMFS technique called Acoustic Force Spectroscopy (AFS). Further, the simulation was validated through consideration of the conservation of energy of the tether-bead system, trend analyses, and comparison of particle positional data from actual TPM in silico experiments conducted to simulate data with a parameter space similar to the AFS experimental setup. Overall, our TPM simulator and graphical user interface is suitable for use in an academic context and serves as a template for researchers to set up TPM simulations to mimic their specific SMFS experimental setup."

J.; Maloy, J. P.; Owens, M. T.",Melinda T Owens,2022-09-03,scientific communication and education,"Active learning, including student thinking and discussion in class, has been shown to increase student learning gains. However, it is less clear how variations in how instructors implement active learning affect student gains. Our study aims to investigate the extent to which the time spent on individual episodes of active learning activities influences student performance. We hypothesized that instructors who let students spend more time on peer discussion and individual thinking on practice problems associated with particular learning objectives will have better student exam scores on exam questions addressing those objectives. To test this hypothesis, we obtained a large data set of classroom recordings and student exam scores from an introductory biology course at a large four-year university, where three instructors shared identical teaching materials and exams for different course offerings.

Contrary to our hypothesis, although the three instructors spent significantly different amounts of time on episodes of thinking and peer discussion, there was no correlation between the total time spent on active learning activities and student performance on exam questions. Linear mixed-effects modeling of the effect of length of episodes of student thinking and discussion on exam score found that the amount of course time spent on active learning activities did not reliably predict student performance on associated exam questions. This result held true even when only considering learning objectives with high variations in performance between offerings, difficult exam questions, exam questions requiring higher-order thinking skills, or within-instructor performance. Although our study was only conducted in one course, our results imply that time spent per individual episode of student thinking or peer discussion may not be the primary factor explaining the positive effects of active learning and that it may be worthwhile to explore other factors."

D.",Anton Sugolov,2022-09-06,scientific communication and education,"Teaching statistics through engaging applications to contemporary large-scale datasets is essential to attracting students to the field. To this end, we developed a hands-on, week-long workshop for senior high-school or junior undergraduate students, without prior knowledge in statistical genetics but with some basic knowledge in data science, to conduct their own genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The GWAS was performed for open source gene expression data, using publicly-available human genetics data. Assisted by a detailed instruction manual, students were able to obtain [~]1.4 million p-values from a real scientific study, within several days. This early motivation kept students engaged in learning the theories that support their results, including regression, data visualization, results interpretation, and large-scale multiple hypothesis testing. To further their learning motivation by emphasizing the personal connection to this type of data analysis, students were encouraged to make short presentations about how GWAS has provided insights into the genetic basis of diseases that are present in their friends and/or families. The appended open source, step-by-step instruction manual includes descriptions of the datasets used, the software needed, and results from the workshop. Additionally, scripts used in the workshop are archived on Zenodo to further enhance reproducible research and training."

Whether people are more concerned about freshwater mussels has a large role to play in promoting and supporting political decisions that protect their habitat. A pilot study was performed in the Midwest of the United States to evaluate the awareness people have about freshwater mussels both native and non-native. Using semi-structured face-to-face interviews, I explore whether ecological knowledge is still in place in the community, and what the relationship is between knowledge, age and urbanization. Multinomial logistic regression has shown that population size and age class are significant predictors of ecological knowledge. Present results suggest that common channels of ecological knowledge transmission have been interrupted long ago. As a result, local ecological knowledge is being substituted by modern ecological knowledge. Nevertheless, new processes of ecological knowledge acquisition emerge. Under this scenario, future management prospects would rely on state institutions which are implementing alternative dissemination pathways in modern socio-ecological systems."

Yet, an often neglected problem is the need for effectively communicating the species extinction crisis to diverse audiences in ways that catalyse immediate action. Here we generated a streamlined threatened species recovery report card methodology, which combined two input indicators including planning and funding, one output indicator capturing habitat protection, and one outcome indicator which highlights threatened species trajectories, to provide simple scores for all Australian threatened species. We show that just 41 (2.3%) of species achieved an A grade for the input indicator (i.e., recovery plans and federal funding), 240 (13.3%) achieved a C grade, and 1,521 (84.4%) achieved an F. Five hundred and twenty nine (29.3%) species achieved an A for the output indicator (i.e, habitat protection), 130 (7.2%) achieved a B, 158 (8.8%) achieved a C, 189 (10.5%) achieved a D, 212 (11.8%) achieved an E, and 584 (32.4%) achieved a F. While five (0.3%) species achieved an A for the output indicator (i.e., threat status improvement), every other species (99.7%) achieved an F. We provide a method to combine scores to test how individual jurisdictions are tracking and show that Australia is achieving an F for the input and outcome indicators, and a D for the output indicator. While the threatened species recovery report card highlighted a clear failure in many federal environmental legislation responsibilities, it provides a baseline from which different governments can track policy progress and outlines clear direction for immediate improvement including developing adequate recovery plans, funding the actions in the recovery plans, protecting habitat from further destruction, verifying recovery through monitoring and evaluation of species trajectories, and supporting transparency and collaboration on the execution on the plans through an improved data infrastructure. Without an immediate step change in how Australia communicates and faces its species crisis, we will leave a tragic legacy of extinction and fail our obligations to future generations of Australians, and the international community."

By conducting an online survey, which included a short-term Before-After-Control-Impact experiment, the author noted an overall increase in respondents ecological knowledge after exposure to a dissemination campaign. More importantly, exposure to information through social media affected peoples willingness to change their vote intention to support conservation-oriented policies. The current study results suggest that key stakeholders in biodiversity conservation (i.e., researchers, managers, and conservationists) adopting an active role to increase biodiversity valuation may lead to a new form of ecological knowledge acquisition in modern societies."

The mixed ownership system of university post achievements, which gives universities and inventors the freedom to dispose of the rights of scientific and technological achievements, and fundamentally stimulates the enthusiasm of all the achievement owners to transform their achievements, is an important exploration to promote the transformation of scientific and technological achievements. However, there are still many problems in the implementation of the mixed ownership of scientific and technological achievements in colleges and universities. Through the questionnaire survey and analysis, it is found that the four problems such as defects in the management system for the distribution of rights and interests of scientific and technological achievements, imperfect evaluation indicators of scientific and technological achievements, imbalance in the service system for the transformation of scientific and technological achievements, and lack of authoritative standards for the evaluation of the value of the transformation of scientific and technological achievements are the main problems hindering the development of mixed ownership of the current college post achievements. Based on the existing problems, it is proposed to continue to improve the management system, assessment system and service system of mixed ownership of scientific and technological achievements in colleges and universities. The research results can provide new evidence and policy enlightenment for the development of mixed ownership of scientific and technological achievements in colleges and universities in China."

Scientific, ethical, social and economic considerations linked to the use of animals raise concerns in a variety of societal contributors (regulators, policy makers, non-governmental organisations, industry, etc.).

The aim of this study was to record researchers voice about their vision on this science evolution, to reconstruct as truthful as possible an image of the reality of health and life science research, by using a key instrument in the hands of the researcher: the experimental models.

Hence, we surveyed European-based health and life sciences researchers, to reconstruct and decipher the varying orientations and opinions of this community over these large transformations. In the interest of advancing the public debate and more accurately guide the policy of research, it is important that policy makers, society, scientists and all stakeholders (1) mature as comprehensive as possible an understanding of the researchers perspectives on the selection and establishment of the experimental models, and (2) publicly share research community opinions, regarding the external factors influencing their professional work. Our results highlighted a general homogeneity of answers from the 117 respondents. However some discrepancies on specific key issues and topics were registered in the subgroups. These recorded divergent views might prove useful to research policy makers and regulators to calibrate their agenda and shape the future of the European health and life science research."

The SARS-CoV-2 Lentivirus Surrogate Neutralization Assay (SCLSNA) can be used in biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) laboratories and has been shown to be a reliable, alternative approach to the plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). In this study, we optimized and validated the SCLSNA to assess its ability as a comparator and pre-screening method to support the PRNT. Comparability between the PRNT and SCLSNA was determined through clinical sensitivity and specificity evaluations. Clinical sensitivity and specificity produced acceptable results with 100% (95% CI: 94-100) specificity and 100% (95% CI: 94-100) sensitivity against ancestral Wuhan spike pseudotyped lentivirus. The sensitivity and specificity against B.1.1.7 spike pseudotyped lentivirus resulted in 88.3% (95% CI: 77.8 to 94.2) and 100% (95% CI: 94-100), respectively. Assay precision measuring intra-assay variability produced acceptable results for High (1:[&ge;] 640 PRNT50), Mid (1:160 PRNT50) and Low (1:40 PRNT50) antibody titer concentration ranges based on the PRNT50, with %CV of 14.21, 12.47, and 13.28 respectively. Intermediate precision indicated acceptable ranges for the High and Mid concentrations, with %CV of 15.52 and 16.09, respectively. However, the Low concentration did not meet the acceptance criteria with a %CV of 26.42. Acceptable ranges were found in the robustness evaluation for both intra-assay and inter-assay variability. In summary, the validation parameters tested met the acceptance criteria, making the SCLSNA method fit for its intended purpose, which can be used to support the PRNT."

E.; Adomah-Afari, A.",Simon Peter Katongole,2022-09-17,scientific communication and education,"Misdiagnosis of inpatients is a major public health issue whose scope and causes are unknown in Sub-Saharan African countries. The purpose of this cross-sectional study, which was conducted in five hospitals in central Uganda, was to identify the factors associated with inpatient misdiagnosis in general hospitals in Central Uganda. Records of 2,431 patients admitted between July 1st, 2019 and June 30th, 2020 were specifically reviewed to obtain data on variables thought to be associated with misdiagnosis. The admission diagnosis assigned at the emergency or outpatient department was compared to the discharge diagnosis assigned immediately after the patients admission, with any difference considered a misdiagnosis. The disease, patient, health system, and environmental factors associated with misdiagnosis were identified using multivariable logistic regression analysis.

Misdiagnosis was found in the records of 223/2431 (9.2%) of the admitted patients. A patient admitted to Nakaseke hospital [aOR=1.95, 95% CI=1.17-3.25, p=0.01], being admitted at night [aOR=3, 95% CI=1.81-5.02, p0.01], male patient [aOR=1.89, 95% CI=1.35-2.64, p0.01], patients age groups 10-19 [AOR=2.3, 95% CI=2.3-9.25, p0.01]; 20-29 [AOR=8.15, 95% CI=4.18-15.89], p<0.01; 30-39; and 40-49;; AOR=8.12, 95% CI=3.99-16.54, p<0.01; AOR=7.88, 95% CI=3.71-16.73, p<0.01; and AOR=12.14, 95% CI=6.41-23.01, p<0.0]. Misdiagnosis was also associated with multimorbidity (aOR=4.71, 95% CI=1.91-11.65, p0.01) and patients treated for uncommon diseases (aOR=2.57, 95% CI=1.28-5.18, p0.01). Patients without underlying diseases [aOR=0.63; 95% CI=0.43-0.91, p=0.015] and those who were not referred [aOR=0.51; 95% CI=0.31-0.86, p=0] .011] were less likely to be related to misdiagnosis.

To improve diagnostic accuracy, hospitals should reorganize patient admission processes, conducted targeted training, develop policy or guidelines targeting factors predisposing to misdiagnosis, and the adopt a diagnostic error prevention culture."

While many new programs bridge the arts and sciences, conducting comprehensive examination of exiting art-science programs can produce more efficient training and program development guidance for improving visual communications in the sciences. Here, we recruited a variety of scientists and artists to collaborate in creating visual science communication products over three summers. Using survey data, we performed qualitative and quantitative analyses to define sources for negative and positive experiences and outcomes from the Vanderbilt Institute for Infection, Immunology, and Inflammation (VI4) Artist-in-Residence (AiR) program. Further, we analyze responses from participants, student-artists and faculty, to specify areas for improvement and areas successful in producing a positive experience and outcome in an AiR program. We found that time and virtual delivery of the program could be modified to improve the experience. Additionally, we found that student participants had more positive responses about ""learning something new"" from the program than faculty members. However, the most surprising aspect of our analysis suggests that for both ""way of thinking"" and ""science communication to the public or general audience,"" there may be more significant beneficial gains for faculty compared to students. We conclude this analysis with suggestions to enhance the benefits and outcomes of an AiR program and ways to minimize the difficulties, such as communication and collaboration, faced by participants and program designers."

W.",Michael W Hudoba,2022-09-17,scientific communication and education,"DNA origami is a rapidly emerging nanotechnology that enables researchers to create nanostructures with unprecedented geometric precision that have tremendous potential to advance a variety of fields including molecular sensing, robotics, and nanomedicine. Hence, many students could benefit from exposure to basic knowledge of DNA origami nanotechnology. However, due to the complexity of design, cost of materials, and cost of equipment, experiments with DNA origami have been limited mainly to research institutions in graduate level laboratories with significant prior expertise and well- equipped laboratories. This work focuses on overcoming critical barriers to translating DNA origami methods to educational laboratory settings. In particular, we present a streamlined protocol for fabrication and analysis of DNA origami nanostructures that can be carried out within a 2-hour laboratory course using low-cost equipment, much of which is readily available in educational laboratories and science classrooms. We focus this educational experiment module on a DNA origami nanorod structure that was previously developed for drug delivery applications. In addition to fabricating nanostructures, we demonstrate a protocol for students to analyze structures via gel electrophoresis using classroom-ready gel equipment. These results establish a basis to expose students to DNA origami nanotechnology and can enable or reinforce valuable learning milestones in fields such as biomaterials, biological engineering, and nanomedicine. Furthermore, introducing students to DNA nanotechnology and related fields can also have the potential to increase interest and future involvement by young students.

We recognized that the primary source of these challenges was the service-centric approach. So, we initiated the transformation of our bioinformatics core, Computational Sciences (CS), at the Jackson Laboratory (Jax) to be a science-centric collaborative research partner for our faculty and project stakeholders. We call our model as collaborative partnership model. With the effective replacement of the service model with the collaborative partnership model, CS now acts as both an effective collaborator and a co-driver of scientific research and innovation at Jax. In this paper, we describe the principles and practices we adopted to realize this transformation and present the resulting growth in the impact of CS in the research enterprise at Jax."

Results from repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance revealed that all of the self-reported perceptions of skills improved significantly upon completion of the course. Hierarchical regressions revealed that underrepresented minority learners had greater gains in their development of skills in career planning, resilience, and self-reflection. Qualitative analysis of learners responses to learning activities found that postdocs perceived networking and mentor support as contributing factors to their skill advancement while tensions among multiple obligations and concerns of uncertainties were significant challenges to applying those skills."

There is a lack of validated measures that capture user experience to inform of the technology utility. We aimed to establish a consensus of items and domains that different simulation experts would include in a measure for immersive technology use.

MethodsA 3-stage modified Delphi using online software was conducted to support the conceptual framework for the proposed measure. The first round was informed by prior work on immersive technology in simulation. In the first round, participants were asked to describe what we could measure in simulation-based education and technology. Thematic analysis generated key themes that were presented to the participants in the second round. Ranking of importance in round 2 was determined by mean rank scores. The final round was an online meeting for final consensus discussion and most important domains by experts were considered.

ResultsA total of 16 simulation experts participated in the study. A consensus was reached on the ideal measure in immersive technology simulation that would be a user questionnaire and domains of interest would be: what was learnt, the degree of immersion experienced, fidelity provided, debrief, psychological safety and patient safety. No consensus was reached with the barriers that this technology introduces in education.

ConclusionsThere is varied opinion on what we should prioritise in measuring the experience in simulation practice. Importantly, this study identified key areas that aids our understanding on how we can measure new technology in educational settings. Synthesising these results in to a multidomain instrument requires a systematic approach to testing in future research"

M.",Jiaxian Shen,2022-10-03,scientific communication and education,"As the scientific literature grows exponentially and research becomes increasingly interdisciplinary, accurate and high-throughput reference deduplication is vital in evidence synthesis studies (e.g., systematic reviews, meta-analyses) to ensure the completeness of datasets while reducing the manual screening burden. Existing tools fail to fulfill these emerging needs, as they are often labor-intensive, insufficient in accuracy, and limited to clinical fields. Here, we present RefDeduR, a text-normalization and decision-tree aided R package that enables accurate and high-throughput reference deduplication. We modularize the pipeline into text normalization, three-step exact matching, and two-step fuzzy matching processes. We also introduce a decision-tree algorithm, consider preprints when they co-exist with a peer-reviewed version, and provide actionable recommendations. Therefore, the tool is customizable, accurate, high-throughput, and practical.

Here we report on the numbers and diversity of content, viewers, and presenters from 2 years and 100 episodes of weekly livestreams. Presented topics encompass all areas of polar research, social issues related to climate change, and new technologies to deal with the changing world and climate ahead. We show that constant engagement by a group of co-hosts, and presenters from all topics, career stages, and genders enable a continuous growth of views and subscriptions, i.e. impact. After 783 days the channel gained 30,251 views and 828 subscribers and hosted well-known scientists while enabling especially early career researchers to improve their outreach and media skills. We show that interactive and science-related videos, both live and on-demand, within a pleasant atmosphere, can be produced voluntarily while maintaining high quality.

F.",Elisabet Benitez,2022-10-07,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundDuring 2019-2020 while COVID-19 pandemic, the Americas were facing the biggest dengue fever epidemic in recent history. Traditional vector control programs, based on insecticide application have been insufficient to control the spread of dengue fever. Several studies suggest refocusing on education with the aim of an integrated vector management strategy within the local ecological-community context. We aim to assess community perceptions, knowledge, attitude, preventive practice, and action through student-led science assignments regarding dengue fever, prevention, and socio-ecological factors in temperate Cordoba, Argentina.

MethodsThe study was conducted during the COVID-19 quarantine when schools switched to online education for the first time. Several activities through Google Classroom platform included a survey to one students family member, and an outdoor activity to assess their attitudes and to clean the backyard and gardens.

ResultsSignificant number of respondents developed good preventive practices and increased their knowledge about the vector and disease highlighting that 75% of responders knew that dengue fever was transmitted by a mosquito, 81.96% declared having obtained knowledge regarding dengue and vector through television, 56% affirm that dengue is a severe illness, 67% of respondents admitted that individuals play an important role in the prevention of dengue. Regarding mosquito control activities, 90% of respondents reported turning containers.

ConclusionsThis highlights the need for school programs with curricula to address vector biology and the prevention of vector-borne diseases not only during activity periods when mosquitoes batter people but all year long to do real prevention."

Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, ERIC and ASSIA were searched for articles published between 1996-2020 in Canada, United States, Australia, and New Zealand. The Joanna Briggs Institutes three-step search strategy was used as was the PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews. Data was charted and synthesized in three stages.

Results134 were included in this review. Data was extracted on four themes: 1) Article Characteristic; 2) Cultural Safety Concepts, Critiques and Rationale; 3) Characteristics of Cultural Safety Training; and 4) Evaluation Details of Cultural Safety Training. Findings suggest that research on cultural safety training programs in health, social work and education has grown significantly. Nursing and medicine professions have received a significant proportion of cultural training programs, compared with general/allied health, social work, and education. Across fields, professionals and students were targeted equally by training programs. Only half of evaluations of cultural safety and related intervention identified methodological limitations.

ImplicationsConsidering, comparing, and contrasting literature on cultural safety and related concepts and how they are applied in practice would advance this scholarly work, as would more robust evaluations of cultural safety and similar training interventions to understand their impact at the individual level. Finally, commitment to meaningfully engage Indigenous communities to develop, implement and evaluate such programs is urgently needed."

S.; Wang, J.; Roychowdhury, D.",Michael S Lauer,2022-10-07,scientific communication and education,"We analyzed changes in total costs for National Institutes of Health (NIH) awarded Research Project Grants issued from 1998 to 2003. The NIH uses a data-driven price index - the Biomedical Research and Development Price Index (BRDPI) - to account for inflation based increases in grant costs. The BRDPI was higher than the general rate of inflation from 1998 until 2012; since then, the rate of inflation for NIH-funded research has been similar to the general rate of inflation. Despite increases in nominal costs, recent years have seen increases in the absolute numbers of RPG and R01 awards. Real (BRDPI-adjusted) average and median RPG costs increased during the NIH-doubling (1998 to 2003), but have remained relatively stable since. Of note, though, the degree of variation of RPG costs has changed over time, with more marked extremes observed on both higher and lower levels of cost. On both ends of the cost spectrum, the agency is funding a greater proportion of solicited projects, with nearly half of RPG money going towards solicited projects. After adjusting for potential confounders in a wholly non-parametric machine learning regression, we find no independent association of time with BRDPI-adjusted costs."

S.",Rebeccah S Lijek,2022-10-07,scientific communication and education,"Undergraduate education on science publishing and peer review is limited compared to the focus on experimental research. Since peer review is integral to the scientific process and central to the identity of a scientist, we envision a paradigm shift that makes teaching peer review integral to undergraduate science education, and hypothesize that this may facilitate the development of students scientific literacy and identity formation. To this end, we developed a curriculum for biology undergraduates to learn about the mechanisms of peer review, then write and publish their own peer reviews as a way to authentically join the scientific community of practice. The curriculum was implemented as a semester-long intervention in one class and as a module intervention embedded into a discipline-based class on vaccines. Before and after both interventions, we measured students scientific literacy, including peer review ability, using quantitative methods. We also carried out a longitudinal qualitative assessment of students perceptions of their scientific literacy and identity using thematic analysis of students writing. Here, we present data on the improvement in peer review ability of undergraduates in both classes, and data on the curriculums interrelated impact on students development of scientific literacy, identity, and belonging in academic and professional spaces. These data suggest that undergraduates can and should be trained in peer review to foster the interrelated development of their scientific literacy, scientific identity, and sense of belonging in science."

K.; Sikweyiya, Y.",Wanangwa Manda,2022-10-11,scientific communication and education,"Early adolescence is a period characterized by enormous biological, cognitive, sexual, emotional, and social changes. Sexual curiosity and the desire to acquire sexual health (SH) information are part of these developments. Understanding the SH knowledge acquisition process is critical for designing interventions that can best support very young adolescents (VYAs). This study explored the SH knowledge acquisition processes among VYA girls aged 10 to 14 years who attended the DREAMs Girl Only Clubs (GOCs) and those who did not. The GOCs were a part of a larger comprehensive HIV prevention project called DREAMS (Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored, and Safe) which provided an evidence-based core package of interventions to VYAs to prevent HIV. In-depth interviews were conducted with 43 VYA girls aged 10-14 years in two rural southern districts of Zomba and Machinga in Malawi. Twenty-three VYA girls were GOC participants and 20 VYAs were not. Guided by the Social Ecological Model, a thematic analysis approach was used to analyze the data with the assistance of Nvivo 12 software. The SH knowledge acquisition processes were the interaction of various factors at the microsystem (biological factors, attitudes), mesosystem (parents, older relatives, friends), and exosystem levels (schools and GOCs). Factors influencing this interaction included the beginning of menstruation, supportive parents/adults on SH issues, trust and confidentiality in SH information sources, and preference for well-informed sources of information. Compared to Non-GOC participants, GOC participants demonstrated an in-depth knowledge of SH issues, and positive sexual behaviors such as HIV testing. Limitations to SH knowledge acquisition were adult messages focus on sexual relationship avoidance and on girls who have started menstruation; perception of adults not being knowledgeable about SH and school teachers hiding some SH information. VYA SH interventions that provide VYA with accurate SH information such as the GOCs have the potential to address the limitations that other sources have in reaching VYAs. Integrating such interventions with empowering parents, other adults, and teachers with comprehensive SH information and with skills on how to deliver SH information to VYAs can enhance their SH knowledge acquisition and influence positive behavior change."

A.; Pedrotti, M.; Menezes, P.; Vasconcelos, S. M.",Sonia MR Vasconcelos,2022-10-14,scientific communication and education,"Retractions are among the effective measures to strengthen the self-correction of science and the quality of the literature. When it comes to self-retractions for honest errors, exposure of ones own failures is not a trivial matter for researchers. However, self-correcting data, results and/or conclusions has increasingly been perceived as good research practice, although rewarding such practice challenges traditional models of research assessment. In this context, it is timely to investigate who have self-retracted for honest error in terms of country, field, and gender. We show results on these three factors, focusing on gender, as data is scarce on the representation of female scientists in efforts to set the research record straight. We collected 3,822 retraction records, including research articles, review papers, meta-analyses, letters, and others, from the Retraction Watch Database (2010-2021). We screened the dataset collected for research articles retracted for honest error, excluding retractions by publishers, editors, or third parties, and those mentioning any investigation issues. We then categorized the records according to country, field, and gender, after selecting research articles with a sole corresponding author. Our results show that female scientists account for 25% of self-retractions for honest error, with the highest share for women affiliated with US institutions."

W.; Ibrahim, A.; Clark, K.",Sarvenaz Sarabipour,2022-10-19,scientific communication and education,"Faculty at research institutions play a central role in advancing knowledge and careers, as well as promoting the well-being of students and colleagues in research environments. Faculty members must balance a host of activities - such as performing research, teaching, sourcing funds, administrative and service duties - with their roles as educators and mentors. Mentorship from experienced peers has been touted as critical for enabling these myriad roles to allow faculty development, career progression, and satisfaction. However, there is little information available on who supports faculty and best ways to structure a faculty mentorship program for early- and mid-career academics. Furthermore, the extent to which mentorship and mentoring programs have been offered to faculty members has not been widely characterized. It is also unclear what challenges faculty receiving mentorship may face and which aspects could be further improved. In the interest of advocating for increased and enhanced faculty mentoring and mentoring programs, we surveyed faculty (i.e., group leaders) around the world to gather data on whether and how they receive mentoring from peers, senior researchers, informal mentoring programs, or formal mentoring programs at their institutions. We received responses from 457 early- and mid-career faculty and found that a substantial portion of respondents either reported having no mentor or a lack of a formal mentoring scheme. Qualitative responses on the quality of mentorship revealed that the most common complaints regarding mentorship included lack of mentor availability, unsatisfactory commitment to mentorship, and non-specific or non-actionable advice. Our findings further identified key mentorship elements desired by faculty mentees. Based on these suggestions, we identify a need for training for faculty mentors as well as strategies for individual mentors, departments, and institutions for funding and design of more intentional and supportive mentorship programs for early- and mid-career faculty."

D.",Michael D Schaller,2022-10-19,scientific communication and education,"Historically women have been underrepresented in STEM careers. While the number of women receiving doctorate degrees in the biological sciences has exceeded the number of men since approximately 2005, there is still a disparity between the sexes at more advanced career stages. Achieving equity is an important social goal and there is an expected benefit to science since diverse groups outperform homogeneous groups. There are many factors that contribute to the disparity between men and women in science, including a disparity in research productivity. While many studies have documented this ""productivity paradox"" and examined factors driving this disparity, few studies have addressed differences in productivity between men and women doctoral students. This is an important population to assess since the individuals are in the formative stages of their academic career and differences in productivity could have a significant impact on career progression. This study addresses this question and identified more than 42,000 doctoral students in the biological and biomedical sciences working with over 16,000 advisors at 235 institutions in the United States and finds a disparity in research productivity between men and women. Men produce >10% more first author papers, >15% more total papers and their first author papers receive >17% more citations. The findings establish the generality of the gender gap in research productivity among doctoral students in the biological and biomedical sciences. Redressing this gap at the formative stage of young scientists careers, when they are establishing their credentials to advance in their field, is important to address the disparity between the sexes in the biomedical workforce."

R.",Allison D Binley,2022-10-21,scientific communication and education,"Community science (""citizen science"") represent a potentially abundant and inexpensive source of information for biodiversity research. However, analyzing such data has inherent challenges. To explore where and how community science data are translated into scientific knowledge, we conducted a literature review in a sample of 334 peer-reviewed scientific articles. Specifically, we investigated how the use of community science data varied among taxonomic groups and geographic regions, and what threats to biodiversity, if any, were examined. Community science data were used mostly for research on birds and invertebrates, and the data used were mainly from the United States and the United Kingdom. Literature in certain countries used a wider breadth of projects, while others made repeated use of comparably fewer datasets. Community science efforts were largely used to measure abundance, trends, distributions, and range shifts. However, few articles linked these metrics to any particular threats to biodiversity. Furthermore, community science data were used infrequently for research on threatened species and limited mostly to count data rather than collecting more specific information such as life history, phenological or genetic data, suggesting that community science may be underutilized for these key aspects of biodiversity conservation. We conclude that even with the rise of community science data use in research, there remains tremendous potential to better use these existing datasets for biodiversity research."

Respondents from biomedical fields completed surveys administered by the National Institutes of Health Broadening Experiences in Scientific Training (NIH BEST) programs across 17 US institutional sites. Graduate and postdoctoral demographic and survey response data were examined to evaluate the impact of intersectional identities on trainee career self-efficacy. The study hypothesized that race, ethnicity and gender, and the relations between these identities, would impact trainee career self-efficacy. The analysis demonstrated that racial and ethnic group, gender, specific career interests (academic principal investigator vs. other careers), and seniority (junior vs. senior trainee level) were, to various degrees, all associated with trainee career self-efficacy and the effects were consistent across graduate and postdoctoral respondents. Implications for differing levels of self-efficacy are discussed, including factors and events during training that may contribute to (or undermine) career self-efficacy. The importance of mentorship for building research and career self-efficacy of trainees is discussed, especially with respect to those identifying as women and belonging to racial/ethnic populations underrepresented in biomedical sciences. The results underscore the need for change in the biomedical academic research community in order to retain a diverse biomedical workforce."

Many academic institutions have adopted course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) to improve student access to research opportunities. However, potential instructors of a CURE might still face financial or practical hurdles that prevent implementation. Bioinformatics research offers an alternative that is free, safe, compatible with remote learning, and may be more accessible for students with disabilities. Here, we describe a bioinformatics CURE that leverages publicly available datasets to discover novel proteins that target an instructor-determined genomic locus of interest. We use the free, user-friendly bioinformatics platform Galaxy to map ChIP-seq datasets to a genome, which removes the computing burden from students. Both faculty and students directly benefit from this CURE, as faculty can perform candidate screens and publish CURE results. Students gain not only basic bioinformatics knowledge, but also transferable skills, including scientific communication, database navigation, and primary literature experience. The CURE is flexible and can be expanded to analyze different types of high-throughput data or to investigate different genomic loci in any species."

Graphicacy, the ability to understand graphs, thus became a fundamental cultural skill. Here, we introduce a new measure of graphicacy that assesses the ability to detect a trend in noisy scatterplots (""does this graph go up or down?""). In 3943 educated participants, responses vary as a sigmoid function of the t-value that a statistician would compute to detect a significant trend. We find a minimum level of core graphicacy even in unschooled participants living in remote Namibian villages (N=87) and 6-year-old 1st-graders who never read a graph (N=27). However, the sigmoid slope (the ""graphicacy index"") varies across participants, increases with education, and tightly correlates with statistical knowledge, showing that experience contributes to refining graphical intuitions. Our tool is publicly available online and allows to quickly evaluate intuitive graphics skills.

STATEMENT OF RELEVANCEThe rising cost of gas, the number of Covid deaths, the evolution of temperatures during the summer months: we often face graphs depicting these phenomena. The scientific literature has shown that human adults can intuit, within milliseconds, the statistical trend of these graphs. However, we do not know if these intuitions generalized to unschooled people and, most importantly, how to measure their variations in the population. In this study we show that intuitive graphics skills are present even in 6-year-old children who never saw a graph and in the Himba of Namibia, an indigenous people with no access to formal schooling. Furthermore, we developed a quantitative assessment of such intuitive graphics skills (which we called the ""graphicacy index""), that everyone can easily obtain for free, through a short (10 minutes) online test: https://neurospin-data.cea.fr/exp/lorenzo-ciccione/graphicacy-index/. In summary, our study provides the first attempt to formally quantify human intuitions of statistical graphs."

The apps allow users to create high-quality 3D models from photos taken with a phone or tablet. Metaverse and 3D digitization are the future of technology. Implementation of these approaches into the anatomy can change education style. Also, 3D printing technology along with the digitization of real-sized organs enables researchers and clinicians to study with 3D printed organs in class, even with augmented reality glasses. In this study, we first aimed to 3D digitized an animal organ with its real sizes to print in a 3D printer. Next, we wanted to digitize decellularized form of the organ, which suggests researchers study extracellular matrix and vascularization. This digitization of the different organ forms can improve the progression of artificial organ studies. Free and easy-to-use iOS or Android applications for 3D digitization enable medical students to study not only animal organs but cadavers. Hereby, we are suggesting organ scanning can be done on a daily basis in a standard laboratory. It is aimed to enable medical students to work effectively in anatomy lessons in Metaverse or in real cases, thanks to the anatomical library created with the accessibility brought by easy usability."

We explored the potential of using simulation games to engage with sheep farmers on the ongoing challenge of reducing lameness. Working with UK stakeholders, we developed a game in which players are challenged with identifying all the lame sheep in a simulated flock. Here, we evaluate the games potential to act as a tool for to help assess, train and understand farmers ability to recognise the early signs of lameness.

MethodsParticipants in the UK were invited to play the game in an online study, sharing with us their in-game scores alongside information relating to their real-life farming experience, how they played the game, and feedback on the game. Mixed methods were used to analyse this information in order to evaluate the game. Quantitative analyses consisted of linear modelling to test for statistical relationships between participants in-game recall (% of the total number of lame sheep that were marked as lame), and the additional information they provided. Qualitative analyses of participants feedback on the game consisted of thematic analysis and a Likert Scale questionnaire to contextualise the quantitative results and identify additional insights from the study.

ResultsQuantitative analyses identified no relationships between participants (n = 63) recall scores and their real life farming experience, or the lameness signs they looked for when playing the game. The only relationship identified was a relationship between participants recall score and time spent playing the game. Qualitative analyses identified that participants did not find the game sufficiently realistic or engaging, though several enjoyed playing it and saw potential for future development. Qualitative analyses also identified several interesting and less-expected insights about real-life lameness recognition practices that participants shared after playing the game.

DiscussionSimulation games have potential as a tool in livestock husbandry education and research, but achieving the desired levels of realism and/or engagingness may be an obstacle to realising this. Future research should explore this potential further, aided by larger budgets and closer collaboration with farmers, stockpeople and veterinarians."

Teachers and students had to face a new reality for which they were not prepared adapting in an improvised way new methods and strategies to teach and to learn. Within virtual education, exams reduced in some cases to multiple choice tests while others tried to mimic traditional (pen and paper) exams. In this paper, these two kind of evaluations are compared. Although the results appear to be similar, a deeper look shows that their structure is completely different and some groups of students are unfairly harmed or benefited depending on the assessment applied. Beyond analyzing the reasons of this discrepancy, it is determined that for some type of evaluation, at least 21.1% of students maybe passing a course irregularly meanwhile, at least 5.5% could be failing a course despite their actual capabilities."

M.; McCandliss, B.",Fang Wang,2022-11-10,scientific communication and education,"Learning to read depends on the ability to extract precise details of letter combinations, which convey critical information that distinguishes tens of thousands of visual word forms. To support fluent reading skill, one crucial neural developmental process is ones brain sensitivity to statistical constraints inherent in combining letters into visual word forms. To test this idea in early readers, we tracked the impact of two years of schooling on within-subject longitudinal changes in cortical responses to different properties of words (coarse tuning for print, and fine tuning to visual word forms and whole word representations) and their growth in reading skill. Three stimulus contrasts--words versus pseudofonts, words versus pseudowords, pseudowords versus nonwords--were presented while high-density EEG Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs, n=31) were recorded. Internalization of abstract visual word form structures over two years of reading experience resulted in a near doubling of SSVEP amplitude, with increasing left lateralization. Longitudinal changes in brain responses to such word form structural information were linked to the growth in reading, especially in rapid automatic naming for letters. No such changes were observed for whole word representation processing and coarse tuning for print. Collectively, these findings indicate that sensitivity to visual word form structure develops rapidly through exposure to print and is linked to growth in reading skill.

This has also meant that the number of corresponding publications has become complex and unmanageably large in human terms. In the current state of the research field, there is a lack of bibliometric analysis, which would prove useful for obtaining insights into the large amounts of available literature. Therefore, the present work aims to identify important research issues, elucidate the conceptual structure of the research field, and unpack the evolutionary trends and the direction of hot topics regarding key themes in the research field of artificial intelligence in sports. Using the Scopus database, 1215 documents (reviews and articles) were selected. Bibliometric analysis was performed using VOSviewer and bibliometrix R package. The main findings are as follows: (a) the literature and research interest concerning AI and its subcategories is growing exponentially; (b) the top 20 most cited works comprise 32.52% of the total citations; (c) the top 10 journals are responsible for 28.64% of all published documents; (d) strong collaborative relationships are present, as along with small, isolated collaboration networks of individual institutions; (e) the three most productive countries are China, the USA, and Germany; (f) different research themes can be characterized using author keywords with current trend topics, e.g., in the fields of biomechanics, injury prevention or prediction, new algorithms, and learning approaches. AI research activities in the fields of sports pedagogy, sports sociology, and sports economics seem to have played a subordinate role thus far. Overall, the findings of this study expand knowledge on the research situation as well as the development of research topics regarding the use of artificial intelligence in sports, and may guide researchers to identify currently relevant topics and gaps in the research."

R.; Kuiken, T.",Graham C Smith,2022-11-13,scientific communication and education,"As scientists we cause an above average carbon footprint for work-related travel. International conferences are a common way for us to meet and discuss, and we do not address the environmental costs of these meetings. Knowing the costs might help us to reduce them. Here we estimated the carbon footprint of the last five physical conferences of the European Wildlife Disease Association (EWDA). We obtained the number of participants from each country for those conferences, and along with assumed travel options, commuting, accommodation, meals and printing, estimated the carbon emissions for each conference. The estimate ranged from 155 to 1205 tons CO2 per conference, or 0.7 to 2.4 tons per person. The outlying upper value was due to one joint global conference of the EWDA and the American mother association (WDA), which takes place every eight years. The geocentre was calculated for both the country of origin of the average conference attendants and for the society membership. The former was located in Luxembourg, and the latter near Dusseldorf, Germany, just approximately 170 km to the north. This represents the shortest total distance attendees would travel. Air transport to the conference country was the major source of CO2 emissions (87-97%), and the average distance flown per person increased from 1000 km (2010) to over 2000 km (2018), since later conferences were generally further from the geocentre. The biggest reduction in carbon emissions (up to 100 tons CO2) could therefore be achieved by decreasing air travel. This could be brought about by reducing the overall travel distance to the conference, i.e. a conference location near the membership geocentre, or - by a lesser amount - by encouraging travel to the conference by train or bus, i.e. conference location near good public travel hubs, and by promoting virtual attendance. Minor but yet substantial savings could be made elsewhere (2-6 tons CO2), including providing accommodation in greener hotels located closer to the conference venue and offering vegan/local food as the default option."

B.",Michael  Bruce Jarstfer,2022-11-16,scientific communication and education,"PurposeWhile known by many names, qualifying exams function as gatekeepers to graduate student advancement to PhD Candidacy, yet there has been little formal study on best qualifying exam practices particularly in biomedical and related STEM PhD programs. The purpose of this study was to examine the current state of qualifying exams through an examination of the literation and exploration of university policies.

Design/methodology/approachWe conducted a literature review of studies on qualifying exams and completed an external evaluation of peer institutions and internal institutional qualifying exam requirements to inform our discussion of common practices of qualifying exams in doctoral training at a research-intensive institutions.

FindingsOur research identified the need for more evidence-based research on qualifying exams, which are nearly universal as a major doctoral training milestone across US institutions of higher education. Our findings indicate a wide variety of qualifying exam formats, often lacking the establishment of explicit expectations and evidence for specific formats. This lack of understanding of best practices coupled with insufficient clarity has a real potential to disadvantage doctoral students, particularly first generation, underrepresented minority, international, and/or other trainees who are not privileged or socialized to navigate training environments with vague landmarks such as the qualifying exams.

OriginalityThere are very few studies that evaluate qualifying exams in US doctoral education, particularly in STEM fields, and to our knowledge, there has been no analysis of campus wide policies on qualifying exams reported. The lack of evidence for best practices and the need for to evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of qualifying exams are discussed."

The efficacy of the CREATE approach has been demonstrated in a diversity of higher education settings and courses. It is, however, not yet known if CREATE can be successfully implemented online with a large, diverse team of faculty untrained in the CREATE pedagogy. Here, we present the transformation of a large-enrollment, multi-section, multi-instructor course for first-year students in which instructors follow different biological research questions but work together to reach shared goals and outcomes. We assessed students: (1) science self-efficacy and (2) epistemological beliefs about science throughout an academic year of instruction fully administered online as a result of ongoing threats posed by COVID-19. Our findings demonstrate that novice CREATE instructors with varying levels of teaching experience and ranks can achieve comparable outcomes and improvements in students science efficacy in the virtual classroom as a teaching team. This study extends the use of the CREATE strategy to large, team-taught, multi-section courses and shows its utility in the online teaching and learning environment."

Here, we develop such a tool and present a case study that illustrates its applicability. We demonstrate that the collected records contributed to a better understanding of contemporary, local biodiversity patterns and provided a more realistic representation of understudied groups such as insects and fungi. Importantly, we show that the CNC presented local governments with a cost-effective tool to make informed, evidence-based management and policy decisions, improve education and engagement programs, foster cross-council collaborations, and support a stronger sense of environmental stewardship within the local community."

For each meeting, we constructed a network ( meetome) with team members as nodes, and the number of consecutive speaking turns between members as links. We found that the relative occurrence of role-specific actions correlated with network measures. We discuss how awareness of interactional roles within meetings may help to implement a translational approach in interdisciplinary research teams."

Kaste,2022-11-17,scientific communication and education,"The modeling of rates of biochemical reactions - fluxes - in metabolic networks is widely used for both basic biological research and biotechnological applications. A number of different modeling methods have been developed to estimate and predict fluxes, including kinetic and constraint-based (Metabolic Flux Analysis and Flux Balance Analysis) approaches. Although different resources exist for teaching these methods individually, to-date no resources have been developed to teach these approaches in an integrative way that equips learners with an understanding of each modeling paradigm, how they relate to one another, and the information that can be gleaned from each. We have developed a series of modeling simulations in Python to teach kinetic modeling, Metabolic Control Analysis, l3C-Metabolic Flux Analysis and Flux Balance Analysis. These simulations are presented in a series of interactive notebooks with guided lesson plans and associated lecture notes. Learners assimilate key principles using models of simple metabolic networks by running simulations, generating and using data, and making and validating predictions about the effects of modifying model parameters. We used these simulations as the hands-on computer laboratory component of a four-day metabolic modeling workshop and participant survey results showed improvements in learners self-assessed competence and confidence in understanding and applying metabolic modeling techniques after having attended the workshop. The resources provided can be incorporated in their entirety or individually into courses and workshops on bioengineering and metabolic modeling at the undergraduate, graduate, or postgraduate level."

S.; Abel, I.",Elane  Araujo de Andrade,2022-11-18,scientific communication and education,"Dogs and cats maintain the urban cycle of rabies, and vaccination is the main form of prevention and control of the disease. Brazil has seen human rabies cases transmitted by dogs and cats infected with the bat variant in regions where annual campaigns no longer take place. Although the municipality of Curuca has no cases of urban rabies and viral circulation in wild animals is unknown, there are informal reports of contact of animals and people with vampire bats. This study aimed to identify factors associated with immune response against the rabies virus in dogs and cats in this municipality. A total of 352 dogs and 46 cats were randomly selected for blood collection and their owners answered a questionnaire. The animals were mostly males, aged between 1-3 years, and with unrestricted access to the street. A total of 48.8% of dogs and 32% of cats were not vaccinated in the last anti-rabies campaign, and 4.7% of dogs had been attacked by bats. Among the analyzed samples, only 21.1% had a titration [&ge;] 0.5 IU/mL. Risk factors for not participating in vaccination campaigns included species, presence of veterinary care, and participation in annual vaccination campaigns (OR = 0.46, 2.55, and 15.67 respectively). The animal population was estimated at 18,620 dogs and 4,556 cats. The human:dog ratio was 2.1:1 and the human:cat ratio was 8.7:1. This study revealed that the estimated population of dogs based on the human population was an underestimate for communities in the Amazon region. This was the first time that the number of dogs attacked by bats was determined. Health education with an emphasis on responsible ownership and periodic and biannual rabies vaccinations are recommended for the municipality.

AUTHOR SUMMARYRabies is a viral disease characterized by brain and spinal cord inflammation. It affects all mammals, being almost 100% lethal. Hematophagous bats are one of the main wild reservoirs responsible for outbreaks of human rabies in the state of Para and other regions of Brazil. Vaccination is the most effective form of control and prevention, even where rabies is believed to be under control. The levels of antibodies that fight the rabies virus must be constantly monitored through serological analysis to assess the effectiveness of vaccination programs. In the municipality of Curuca, Para, bats commonly attack people and their pets, and anti-rabies campaigns are not promoted every year. In the present study, we determined the number of attacks by bats on domestic dogs and estimated vaccination coverage and the canine and feline population in the municipality, which was underestimated. This information can be useful for future vaccination campaigns. The study identified factors associated with responsible ownership that interfere with the protective titration of animals against rabies and suggests promoting more than one annual anti-rabies campaign in this location."

Specifically, this study investigated the correlation between students performance and their attitude towards linear programming (LP) linear programming word tasks (ATLPWTs). Tools for data collection were: the adapted Attitude towards Mathematics Inventory-Short Form (ATMI-SF), (=.75) as a multidimensional measurement tool, and linear programming achievement tests (pre-test and post-test). A quantitative approach with a quasi-experimental pre-test, post-test, and non-equivalent control group study design was adopted. A sample of 60811th-grade grade Ugandan students (291 male and 317 female) from eight secondary schools (both public and private) participated. Data were analyzed using PROCESS macro (v.4) for SPSS version 26. The results revealed a direct significant positive relationship between students performance and their ATLPWTs. Thus, it is likely that students attitude positively and directly impacted their performance. The present study contributes to the literature on performance and attitude towards learning mathematics. Overall, the findings carry useful practical implications that can support the theoretical framework for enhancing students performance and attitude towards mathematics word problems."

Furthermore, there are limitations to the current model of restricting Reflective Practice sessions to the Balint Group Format.

MethodsA novel programme of structured Reflective Practice was offered to students in the School of Medicine in The University of Limerick and trainees in the Mid-West Deanery. Six student and fourteen trainee participants were subsequently invited to provide perspectives on the programme via Focus Groups. The study employed an inductive latent phenomenological approach for analysis of qualitative data.

ResultsFive major themes emerged: These related to the teaching environment, personal identity, complexity, awareness of cognitive dissonance and the structure of the sessions. There were a number of different perceptions, relating to the participants stage of training.

ConclusionsThere was evidence that the structured reflective sessions created a comfortable environment, addressed hierarchy issues and facilitated wide-ranging opportunities for reflective practice, with an observed increased appreciation for complexity in Psychiatry. There was apparent tension between controlling content and facilitating the form of group process. Nonetheless, the structure appeared more approachable for medical students and those early in training."

With the increase in attention over preprints during the COVID-19 pandemic, we decided to assess the content of comments left on preprint platforms.

MethodsPreprints posted on bioRxiv and medRxiv in 2020 were accessed through each platforms API, and a random sample of preprints that had received between 1 and 20 comments was analyzed. Comments were evaluated in triplicate by independent evaluators using an instrument that assessed their features and general content.

Results7.3% of preprints received at least 1 comment during a mean follow-up of 7.5 months. Analyzed comments had a median size of 43 words. Criticisms, corrections or suggestions were the most prevalent type of content, followed by compliments or positive appraisals and questions. Most critical comments regarded interpretation, data collection and methodological design, while compliments were usually about relevance and implications.

ConclusionsOnly a small percentage of preprints posted in 2020 in bioRxiv and medRxiv received comments in these platforms. When present, however, these comments address content that is similar to that analyzed by traditional peer review. A more precise taxonomy of peer review functions would be desirable to describe whether post-publication peer review fulfills these roles."

The rapidly growing world population puts pressure on food sources, inviting the need to devise mechanisms to sustain it. Biotechnology has developed important measures for improving plants and livestock as a remedy for food security with aim to achieve the Sustainable Development goal two (2). Globally, the adoption and use of genetically modified foods (GMFs) has been controversial as it is in Uganda today due to concerns related to the risk uncertainties. This study was therefore conducted to assess the public perceptions, knowledge and factors that influence the acceptability of genetically modified foods in Kampala City.

This was a cross sectional quantitative study that involved one hundred and ninety-eight participants. The data were collected using a survey tool and summarized using descriptive and linear regression analysis.

The findings of this study showed that almost two-thirds of participants (129/198, 65%) had some basic knowledge on genetically modified foods. About 45.3% (90/198) of the participants perceived genetically modified foods as being unsafe for human consumption. Eighty-eight participants (44.3%) perceived them as being associated with major human health and environmental safety concerns. The acceptability of these foods was significantly associated with gender, education level, nutritional value and health effects. Female participants were more likely to accept genetically modified foods (OR.4.84 95% CI: 1.37 - 7.68). Those who perceived genetically modified foods as being of high nutrition value were more likely to accept them (OR. 3.07, 95% CI: 1.27 - 7.37).

The public is predominantly aware of genetical modified foods since a big proportion had basic knowledge about them although with a lot of misinformation. People with a higher education level had positive perceptions on the use of these foods hence a need to educate the public to dispel misinformation that influences their acceptability"

Full atom representations retain most of the geometric information but are generally crowded and key structural patterns can be difficult to catch. Non-full atom representations could be more instructive on physicochemical aspects but be insufficiently detailed regarding shapes (e.g., entity beans-like models in coarse grain approaches) or individualistic properties of amino acids (e.g., representation of superficial electrostatic properties). TALAIA aims at providing another layer of structural representations. It is a visual dictionary where each amino acid is represented by a unique object with differentiated shapes and colors. It makes it easier to spot important molecular information including patches of amino acids or key interactions between side chains. Most of the conventions used in TALAIA are common in chemistry and biochemistry so that experimentalists and modelers can rapidly grasp the meaning of any TALAIA depictions.

MotivationThe aim of the work is to offer a visual grammar that combines simplistic representations of amino acids while retaining their general geometry and physicochemical properties.

ResultsWe propose a tool that renders protein structures and encodes both structure and physicochemical aspects as a simple visual grammar. The approach is fast, highly informative, and simple, allowing the identification of possible interactions, hydrophobic patches, and other characteristic structural features at a simple glance.

Using a mixed method approach, we qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed its text, sections and references, alongside 50 affiliated articles. These, we found, documented CRISPRs maturation from a fundamental scientific discovery to a biotechnological revolution with vast social and cultural implications. We developed automated tools to support such research generically and demonstrated its applicability on two other scientific fields we have previously studied - COVID-19 and Circadian clocks. This method makes use of Wikipedia as a digital and free archive, documenting the incremental growth of knowledge and the manner scientific research accumulates and translates into public discourse. Using Wikipedia in this manner compliments and overcomes some issues with contemporary histories and can also augment existing bibliometric research."

B.; Alejielat, R.; Al-Nweiran, A. Z.",Anas Khaleel,2022-11-30,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundThe problem is that approximately half of people with diabetes are unaware that they have the disease. Because there are few signs or symptoms in the early stages of diabetes, unnoticed symptoms will persist until diabetic complications appear just before D.M. is diagnosed. Diabetes is increasing exponentially worldwide, particularly in Africa and the Middle East. This study aims to determine Jordanians awareness of type 2 diabetes among those who visit community pharmacies in Amman, Jordan, as well as clarify the role of community pharmacies in T2DM screening.

MethodsThe design was based on participants who visited community pharmacies in Amman, Jordan, in 2021. The personal contact interview questionnaire collected demographic information, geographic location, educational attainment, and insurance status. In addition, we created 15 knowledge questions. The study included 305 participants. Descriptive and regression analyses were deployed by using SPSS,

ResultsA significant relationship between the type of medical degree and knowledge of risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus was confirmed in this study (p <0.012). Some subjects scored slightly higher than others (n = 175; 57.4% of participants scored above 7, compared to n = 130; 42.6% scored below 7). Although 50.5% of the participants (n = 154) held a bachelors, masters, or doctorate, these degrees did not improve the participants knowledge levels. The association was tested using chi-square analysis, but no significance was found.

ConclusionsRandom visitors to Jordanian community pharmacies are expected to benefit from the current awareness and education campaign. These test results revealed a lack of knowledge, indicating the need for education to dispel myths and highlight the serious risks associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The study discovered that participants understanding of diabetes disease prevention through lifestyle and dietary changes was inadequate. A specialist-led educational program may increase knowledge among visitors who participate. In order to prevent the spread of diabetes, more campaigns and health-promoting prevention educational activities are required."

With software development, anyone can create a neural network model, but little is known about how to prepare the data and how to set up the model algorithms to their maximum performance. For these reasons, this study aims to determine whether features or function settings have a greater effect on model accuracy. An initial feature dataset (n = 18882) was obtained from publicly available sources. Each of the six different feature settings consisted of 96 models. A total of 384 models were created, in which their testing accuracy and the percentage difference between the training and testing phases were further analyzed. No statistically significant differences were found between the accuracy of the functions settings, but statistically significant differences were confirmed between the feature settings. The study found that feature settings, especially the reduction of the number of outputs, are a more important factor in increasing the model accuracy, than function settings. Although the literature focuses more on the function setting and sets feature setting is taken rather as a type of how to improve the model."

The health of women and members of the Two-Spirit, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer or Questioning, Intersex, and Asexual (2S/LGBTQ+) community is often compromised as they experience delays in diagnosis. Distinct knowledge gaps in the health of these populations has prompted funding agencies to mandate incorporation of sex and gender into research. Sex-and gender-informed research perspectives and methodology increases rigor, promotes discovery, and expands the relevance of health research. Thus, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) implemented a Sex and Gender-based Analysis (SGBA) framework recommending the inclusion of SGBA in project proposals in 2010 and then mandating the incorporation of SGBA into grant proposals in 2019. To examine whether this mandate resulted in increased mention of sex or gender in funded research abstracts, we searched the publicly available database of grant abstracts funded by CIHR to analyze the percentage of abstracts that mentioned sex or gender of the population to be studied. To better understand broader health equity issues we also examined whether the funded grant abstracts mentioned either female-specific health research or research within the 2S/LGBTQ+ community.

ResultsWe categorized a total of 8,964 Project and Operating grant abstracts awarded from 2009- 2020 based on their study of female-specific or a 2S/LGBTQ+ populations or their mention of sex or gender. Overall, under 3% of grant abstracts funded by CIHR explicitly mentioned sex and/or gender, as 1.94% of grant abstracts mentioned sex, and 0.66% mentioned gender. As one of the goals of SGBA is to inform on health equity and understudied populations with respect to SGBA, we also found that 5.92% of grant abstracts mentioned female-specific outcomes, and 0.35% of grant abstracts focused on the 2S/LGBTQ+ community.

ConclusionsAlthough there was an increased number of funded grants with abstracts that mentioned sex and 2S/LGBTQ+ health across time, these increases were less than 2% between 2009 to 2020. The percentage of funded grants with abstracts mentioning female-specific health or gender differences did not change significantly over time. The percentage of funding dollars allocated to grants in which the abstracts mentioned sex or gender also did not change substantially from 2009-2020, with grant abstracts mentioning sex or female-specific research increasing by 1.26% and 3.47% respectively, funding allocated to research mentioning gender decreasing by 0.49% and no change for 2S/LGBTQ+-specific health. Our findings suggest more work needs to be done to ensure the public can evaluate what populations will be examined with the funded research with respect to sex and gender to advance awareness and health equity in research.

In a ""Dissolution"" lesson, one of the students took the demonstration experiment of ""carmine dissolves in Water"" demonstrated by the teacher as the prototype to judge whether a new phenomenon belongs to dissolution, instead of analyzing and judging the phenomenon by using the dissolution definition. Therefore, we propose a conjecture that ""prototype matching"" may be a more preferred way for children to learn concepts than thinking through inquiry experiment, analysis, deduction, etc. To this end, we conducted a targeted test on 160 fifth grade students (all of whom had learned this lesson) from a primary school in Beijing, and used goodness of fit test to statistically analyze the results. The results showed that: {sscircled1} the Chi square of the general result is 73.865, P<0.001, indicating that children did have obvious prototype preference; {sscircled2} We ""tampered"" some of the prototypes, that is, they looked like the prototypes that the teacher had told students, but they were actually wrong. However, the results showed that children still preferred these so-called ""prototypes"" (chi square is 21.823, P<0.001). Conclusion: {sscircled1} Children have an obvious preference for ""prototype matching"" in scientific concept learning, which is not only obviously deviated from the current general understanding of science education that emphasizes inquiry construction, but also points out that there may be a priority relationship among various ways of concept organization (such as definition theory, prototype theory, schema theory, etc.). {sscircled2} Childrens preference for prototypes seems to be unthinking, and they will not identify the authenticity of prototypes, which is particularly noteworthy in front-line teaching."

To this end, correlational research was employed. Latest version of scale for rating behavioral characteristics of superior students and Purdue academic rating scale were used to generate data. 100 Ambo University Non-boarding Special Secondary School students (Male = 56, Female = 44) were selected through simple random sampling from grade 9-11. Students academic performances and behavioral characteristics were rated by subject teachers, homeroom teachers, and principals. Results of rating students academic performances revealed that students were at excellent levels in academic performance in English, mathematics, and science whereas at strong average in social studies. Results of correlation analysis showed that there was positive and significant relationship between Mathematics and English language academic performances (r = 0.332, r 2 = 0.11%, p < 0.01, df = n - 2 = 98). Mathematics performance was leading academic performance and in no subject Ambo University Non-boarding Special Secondary School students fell under average performance. 1% of students were self-nominated as gifted. Enrichment services such as health care, science technology engineering and mathematics, and instructional technologies are under satisfactory levels that need attention. Teachers and students should give emphasis to social studies as equal as other subjects."

E.",Sydney  E. Everhart,2022-12-07,scientific communication and education,"Leadership development is a universally important goal across the agricultural plant science disciplines. Although previous studies have identified a need for leadership skills, less is known about leadership skill development in graduate programs. To address this, we constructed a mixed-method study to identify the most significant graduate school leadership experiences of scientists in the agricultural plant science disciplines. The survey was deployed to 6,728 people in the U.S. and received 1,086 responses (16.1% response rate). The majority of respondents reported that they were from one of the major agricultural states and employed at one of the agricultural plant science related doctoral universities, industries, or government. Results from this survey suggest that recent graduates were more engaged in graduate school activities that offered leadership development. Key experiences in graduate school were also identified that may be used to develop future leaders. Additionally, respondents reported the greatest barrier to providing leadership development for graduate students was that it is not part of their program curriculum, however current graduate students responded differently, and identifying lack of funding to support experiences as the greatest barrier. This survey also identified the top ranked professional skills considered most important for effective leaders in agricultural plant sciences as well as respondent-driven recommendations on how graduate programs can improve leadership development. Collectively, these results can be used in the future to identify priorities for skill development and opportunities for graduate student training in leadership skills within the plant science disciplines."

R.",Michael Robert Doran,2022-12-07,scientific communication and education,"In 2019 we surveyed Australian early career researchers (ECRs) working in STEMM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine). ECRs almost unanimously declared a ""love of research"", however, many reported frequent bullying and questionable research practices (QRPs), and that they intended to leave because of poor career stability. We replicated the survey in 2022 to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and sought more information on bullying and QRPs. Here, we compare data from 2019 (658 respondents) and 2022 (530 respondents), and detail poor professional and research conditions experienced by ECRs. Job satisfaction declined (62% versus 57%), workload concerns increased (48.6% versus 60.6%), more indicated ""now is a poor time to commence a research career"" (65% versus 76%) from 2019 to 2022, and roughly half reported experiencing bullying. Perhaps conditions could be tolerable if the ecosystem were yielding well-trained scientists and high-quality science. Unfortunately, there are signs of poor supervision and high rates of QRPs. ECRs detailed problems likely worthy of investigation, but few (22.4%) felt that their institute would act on a complaint. We conclude by suggesting strategies for ECR mentorship, training, and workforce considerations intended to maintain research excellence in Australia and improve ECR career stability."

P.",Alexandra R Davidson,2022-12-10,scientific communication and education,"Research institutions and researchers have become increasingly concerned about poor research reproducibility and replicability, and research waste more broadly. Research institutions play an important role and understanding their intervention options is important. This review aims to identify and classify possible interventions to improve research quality, reduce waste, and improve reproducibility and replicability within research-performing institutions.

Taxonomy development steps: 1) use of an exemplar paper of journal-level research quality improvement interventions, 2) 2-stage search in PubMed using seed and exemplar articles, and forward and backward citation searching to identify articles evaluating or describing research quality improvement, 3) elicited draft taxonomy feedback from researchers at an open-sciences conference workshop, and 4) cycles of revisions from the research team.

The search identified 11 peer-reviewed articles on relevant interventions. Overall, 93 interventions were identified from peer-review literature and researcher reporting. Interventions covered before, during, and after study conduct research stages and whole of institution. Types of intervention included: Tools, Education & Training, Incentives, Modelling & Mentoring, Review & Feedback, Expert involvement, and Policies & Procedures. Identified areas for research institutions to focus on to improve research quality and for further research includes improving incentives to implement quality research practices, evaluating current interventions, encourage no- or low-cost/high-benefit interventions, examine institution research culture, and encourage mentor-mentee relationships."

O.; Devezer, B.",Berna Devezer,2022-12-10,scientific communication and education,"A core problem that has been addressed in the scientific reform movement so far is the low rates of reproducibility of research results. Mainstream reform literature aimed at increasing reproducibility rates by implementing changes in research practice and scientific policy. At the sidelines of reform, theoreticians have worked on understanding the underlying causes of irreproducibility from ground up. Each approach faces its own challenges. While mainstream focus on swift practical changes has not been buttressed by sound theoretical arguments, theoretical work is slow and initially is only capable of answering questions in idealized setups, removed from real life constraints. In this article, we continue to develop theoretical foundations in understanding non-exact replications and meta-hypothesis tests in multi-lab replication studies, juxtapose these theoretical intuitions with practical reform examples, and expose challenges we face. In our estimation, a major challenge in the next generation of the reform movement is to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical advancements."

S.",Tanner Clarkson Myers,2022-12-13,scientific communication and education,"Authors are often faced with the decision of whether to maximize impact or minimize costs when publishing the results of their research. For example, to potentially improve impact via increased accessibility, many subscription-based journals now offer the option of paying a fee to publish open access (i.e., hybrid journals), but this solution excludes authors who lack the capacity to pay to make their research accessible. Here, we tested if paying to publish open access in a subscriptionbased journal benefited authors by conferring more citations relative to closed access articles. We identified 146,415 articles published in 152 hybrid journals in the field of biology from 2013-2018 to compare the number of citations between various types of open access and closed access articles. In a simple generalized linear model analysis of our full dataset, we found that publishing open access in hybrid journals that offer the option confers an average citation advantage to authors of 17.8 citations compared to closed access articles in similar journals. After taking into account the number of authors, journal impact, year of publication, and subject area, we still found that open access generated significantly more citations than closed access (p < 0.0001). However, results were complex, with exact differences in citation rates among access types impacted by these other variables. This citation advantage based on access type was even similar when comparing open and closed access articles published in the same issue of a journal (p < 0.0001). However, by examining articles where the authors paid an article processing charge, we found that cost itself was not predictive of citation rates (p = 0.14). Based on our findings of access type and other model parameters, we suggest that, in most cases, paying for access does confer a citation advantage. For authors with limited budgets, we recommend pursuing open access alternatives that do not require paying a fee as they still yielded more citations than closed access. For authors who are considering where to submit their next article, we offer additional suggestions on how to balance exposure via citations with publishing costs."

MethodsThe first phase of the Pilot focused on archiving preprints reporting NIH-supported SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 research. To launch Phase 1, NLM identified eligible preprint servers and developed processes for identifying NIH-supported preprints within scope in these servers. Processes were also developed for the ingest and conversion of preprints in PMC and to send corresponding records to PubMed. User interfaces were modified for display of preprint records. NLM collected data on the preprints ingested and discovery of preprint records in PMC and PubMed and engaged users through focus groups and a survey to obtain direct feedback on the Pilot and perceptions of preprints.

ResultsBetween June 2020 and June 2022, NLM added more than 3,300 preprint records to PMC (viewed 4 million times) and PubMed (viewed 3 million times) Nearly one-quarter of preprints in the Pilot were not associated with a peer-reviewed published journal article. User feedback revealed that the inclusion of preprints did not have a notable impact on trust in PMC or PubMed.

DiscussionNIH-supported preprints can be identified and added to PMC and PubMed without disrupting existing operations processes. Additionally, inclusion of preprints in PMC and PubMed accelerates discovery of NIH research without reducing trust in NLM literature services. Phase 1 of the Pilot provided a useful testbed for studying NIH investigator preprint posting practices, as well as knowledge gaps among user groups, during the COVID-19 public health emergency, an unusual time with heightened interest in immediate access to research results."

Studies show that gender bias affects the progression of women in academia, but there is evidence that improving conscious awareness of bias can improve equity in this regard. Here we carry out a bibliometric analysis of review articles within the microbiology field to investigate the statistical associations with author gender. We analyse the publication data from 1857 review articles published between 2010 and 2022 in three leading microbiology review journals: Nature Reviews Microbiology, Trends in Microbiology, and Annual Review of Microbiology. We find a significant association between the gender of the lead author and the gender of co-authors in multi-author publications. Review articles with men lead authors have a significantly reduced proportion of women co-authors compared to reviews with women lead authors. Given the existing differences in the proportions of men and women in lead author positions, this association may have important consequences for the relative visibility of women in microbiology, along with potential negative impacts on scientific output relating to reduced collaboration diversity. We further probe associations between gender and citation metrics, acknowledgement of contributions, and publishing during the Covid-19 pandemic within microbiology reviews."

F.",Kyle B McCloskey,2022-12-21,scientific communication and education,"ObjectivesTo develop a typology of poor peer review practices (PPRP) and assess researchers experiences with PPRP.

DesignExploratory analysis of cross-sectional internet-based survey.

ParticipantsWe solicited 500 researchers funded by the NIH extramural grants in 2018 by direct email and 600 bioethicists on a bioethics discussion forum (mcw.bioethics). 112 respondents (~10%) completed the survey.

Primary and Secondary Outcomes MeasuresThe total number of reported PPRP and a five-point scale to assess participants views about the effect of PPRP on their ability to disseminate their research.

ResultsThe mean number of PPRP experienced per author was 12.5 of 28 (44.6%; range 0-27; 95% CI = 11.2-13.8), with fourteen PPRP experienced by 50% or more of the sample. The number of reported PPRP increased with age (P = 0.01) and total number of published peer-reviewed manuscripts (P = 0.02). Authors belonging to underrepresented groups reported more PPRP compared to represented groups (P = 0.05). Most authors viewed the peer review process favorably, with 67% (74/111) of authors responding ""sometimes"" or ""often"" to having received insightful peer reviews that improved the quality of their final papers. However, a total of 57% (63/111) of respondents admitted to previously abandoning a manuscript after receiving what they perceived to be unfair peer reviews.

ConclusionsThis study introduces a practical list of PPRP and a framework for a typology of PPRP, which could serve as an educational tool for editors and reviewers and further our understanding of poor peer review practices. Future researchers will expand authors experiences with constructive or helpful peer review practices.

STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDYO_LIThe sample consisted primarily of experienced researchers from diverse fields, which aided in capturing a wide variety of poor peer review examples.
C_LIO_LIThis survey included a core set of 28 poor peer review practices and allowed respondents to add other practices they had experienced, which helped to generate an extensive list of poor peer review practices.
C_LIO_LIThe generalizability of the prevalence of poor review types and the degree of negative impact on authors should be interpreted with caution due to the low response rate and the potential for response bias.

According to WHO definition of IPE ""its a process between two or more professionals learn about from, and with one another to permit effective association and enhance health outcome. The aim of this study was to measure perception and readiness towards IPE among different health care disciplines. A cross-sectional study was done with two hundred and eighteen post graduate Nursing, public health, physiotherapy, and basic medical sciences students from September,2020 to January,2021 at Khyber Medical University Peshawar Pakistan. Convenient sampling technique was used to collect data. The Readiness for Inter-Professional Learning Scale (RIPLS) and Interdisciplinary Education Perception Scale (IEPS) were used to measure the readiness and perception of students regarding inter-professional leaning. The data were analyzed using software Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) (Version 23). The RIPLS was completed by a total of 218 participants (response rate 100%, 61 Nursing students 28%, 51 physiotherapy students 23.4%, 53 public health students 24.3%, and 53 basic medical sciences students 24.3%).

A.; Howard, F. M.; Markov, N. S.; Dyer, E. C.; Ramesh, S.; Luo, Y.; Pearson, A. T.",Catherine A. Gao,2022-12-27,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundLarge language models such as ChatGPT can produce increasingly realistic text, with unknown information on the accuracy and integrity of using these models in scientific writing.

MethodsWe gathered ten research abstracts from five high impact factor medical journals (n=50) and asked ChatGPT to generate research abstracts based on their titles and journals. We evaluated the abstracts using an artificial intelligence (AI) output detector, plagiarism detector, and had blinded human reviewers try to distinguish whether abstracts were original or generated.

ResultsAll ChatGPT-generated abstracts were written clearly but only 8% correctly followed the specific journals formatting requirements. Most generated abstracts were detected using the AI output detector, with scores (higher meaning more likely to be generated) of median [interquartile range] of 99.98% [12.73, 99.98] compared with very low probability of AI-generated output in the original abstracts of 0.02% [0.02, 0.09]. The AUROC of the AI output detector was 0.94. Generated abstracts scored very high on originality using the plagiarism detector (100% [100, 100] originality). Generated abstracts had a similar patient cohort size as original abstracts, though the exact numbers were fabricated. When given a mixture of original and general abstracts, blinded human reviewers correctly identified 68% of generated abstracts as being generated by ChatGPT, but incorrectly identified 14% of original abstracts as being generated. Reviewers indicated that it was surprisingly difficult to differentiate between the two, but that the generated abstracts were vaguer and had a formulaic feel to the writing.

ConclusionChatGPT writes believable scientific abstracts, though with completely generated data. These are original without any plagiarism detected but are often identifiable using an AI output detector and skeptical human reviewers. Abstract evaluation for journals and medical conferences must adapt policy and practice to maintain rigorous scientific standards; we suggest inclusion of AI output detectors in the editorial process and clear disclosure if these technologies are used. The boundaries of ethical and acceptable use of large language models to help scientific writing remain to be determined."

We wanted to offer students an opportunity to learn computational skills and be part of a community while they were stuck at home. Because the pandemic was very isolating, it was important to support students to learn and build community online. We used lessons learned from literature and our own experience to design, run and test an online program for students called the Science Coding Immersion Program (SCIP). In our program, students worked in small teams for 8 hours a week spread over the week, with one participant as the team leader and Zoom host. Teams worked on an online R or Python class at their own pace with support on Slack from the organizing team. For motivation and career advice, we hosted a weekly webinar with guest speakers. We used pre- and post-program surveys to determine how different aspects of the program impacted students. We were able to recruit a large and diverse group of participants who were happy with the program, found community in their team, and improved their coding confidence. We hope that our work will inspire others to start their own version of SCIP."

These personal commentaries or editorials require taking a delicate stance, balancing the professional, social, and individual. Black authors in the medical publishing space, who already experience microaggressions and racial trauma in their work spaces, must put on their academic armor to further experience them in publishing spaces. Medicine and medical education interpellate each of us, including the authors and readers of this piece, as a particular kind of subject. Beginning with a narrative grounding in the authors personal stances, this study seeks to understand the stances Black physicians and trainees take as they share their personal experiences of racism while protecting the institution of medicine from racisms irreparable harms.

MethodsThe authors searched four databases identifying 29 articles authored by Black physicians and trainees describing their experiences. During initial analysis, the authors identified three sets of discursive strategies: identification (introducing and tracking themselves throughout the article); intertextuality (dialoguing and drawing on other ""texts"" beyond the focus of the articles); and space-time (social constructions of space and time linked to a network of social practices). The authors used a Google form to capture these strategies and direct quotes from the articles. Throughout the study, the authors reflected on their own stances in relation to the experience of conducting the study and its findings.

ResultsAuthors engaged in stance taking, which aligned with the concept of donning academic armor, by evaluating and positioning themselves with respect to racism and the norms of academic discourse in response to ongoing conversations both within medicine and in the broader US culture. They did this by (a) positioning themselves as being Black and, therefore, qualified to notice and name personal racist experiences while also aligning themselves with the reader through shared professional experiences and goals, (b) intertextual connections to other related events, people, and institutions that they-and their readers-value and (c) aligning themselves with a hoped-for future rather than a racist present.

DiscussionBecause the discourses of medicine and medical publishing interpellate Black authors as Others they must carefully consider the stances they take, particularly when naming racism. The academic armor they put on must not only be able to defend them from attack, but help them slip unseen through institutional bodies replete with mechanisms to eject them. In addition to analyzing their own personal stance, authors leave readers with thought provoking questions regarding this armor as they return to narrative grounding."

The plantREU2 internship program resulted from a collaboration between UF and FAMU and was located in UF main campus in Gainesville, Florida. A total of 17 students completed 10-week summer projects in plant biology. The program (PlantREU2) had a strong record of success. Over 40% of plantREU2 students co-authored a journal publication and received travel awards to attend Maize Genetics Conference. Furthermore, plantREU2 participants were significantly graduated within six years. The underrepresentation of minorities in STEM is a critical challenge. The findings of this study can be adapted similarly for underrepresented undergraduates. The vast majority of interns enrolled in post-graduate programs could therefore be a model to engage traditionally underrepresented students in STEM disciplines."

This early and open access of non-peer reviewed research warrants new means from the scientific community to efficiently assess and provide feedback to preprints. Yet, most peer review of scientific studies performed today are still managed by journals, each having their own peer review policy and transparency. However, approaches to uncouple the peer review process from journal publication are emerging. Additionally, formal education of early career researchers (ECRs) in peer reviewing is rarely available, hampering the quality of peer review feedback. Here, we introduce the Preprint Club, a cross-institutional, community-based approach to peer reviewing, founded by ECRs from the University of Oxford, Karolinska Institutet and Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Over the past two years and using the collaborative setting of the Preprint Club, we have been discussing, assessing, and providing feedback on recent preprints in the field of immunology. In this article, we provide a blueprint of the Preprint Club basic structure, demonstrate its effectiveness, and detail the lessons we learned on its impact on peer review training and preprint authors perception."

S.",Casey S Greene,2023-01-06,scientific communication and education,"The value of scientific research can be easier to assess at the collective level than at the level of individual contributions. Several journal-level and article-level metrics aim to measure the importance of journals or individual manuscripts. However, many are citation-based and citation practices vary between fields. To account for these differences, scientists have devised normalization schemes to make metrics more comparable across fields. We use PageRank as an example metric and examine the extent to which field-specific citation norms drive estimated importance differences. In doing so, we recapitulate differences in journal and article PageRanks between fields. We also find that manuscripts shared between fields have different PageRanks depending on which fields citation network the metric is calculated in. We implement a degree-preserving graph shuffling algorithm to generate a null distribution of similar networks and find differences more likely attributed to field-specific preferences than citation norms. Our results suggest that while differences exist between fields metric distributions, applying metrics in a field-aware manner rather than using normalized global metrics avoids losing important information about article preferences. They also imply that assigning a single importance value to a manuscript may not be a useful construct, as the importance of each manuscript varies by the readers field."

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the quality of graft particles generated in two sizes from a custom-built automated milling system (AMS) and their biocompatibility in an animal model. A Monetite block was milled in an AMS to generate small (SS group; 0.5-0.8 mm) and medium size (MS group; 1.0-1.2 mm) particles. Measures of particle count, Ferets diameter (dF), particle distribution and size were recorded. Biocompatibility of particles was tested in a rabbit tibial defect model. The average particle size was significantly smaller in the SS group than the MS group (0.68{+/-}0.39 vs 1.10{+/-}0. 79 mm; p[&le;]0.001). There were significant to highly significant differences between SS and MS groups in measures of particle count (p[&le;]0.001), dF (p=0.02) and size (p[&le;]0.001). SS and MS groups had maximum percentage of particles in the 0.6-1mm (71%) and >1mm (70%) ranges respectively.

Curricula for medical education present challenges due to amount of content, the diversity of topics and the large number of contributing faculty. To create a manageable representation of the content in the pre-clerkship curriculum at Yale School of Medicine, a topic model was generated from all educational documents given to students during the pre-clerkship period. The model was used to quantitatively map content to school-wide competencies. The model measured how much of the curriculum addressed each topic and identified a new content area of interest, gender identity, whose coverage could be tracked over four years.

Through the Fly-CURE, undergraduate students at diverse types of higher education institutions across the United States map and characterize novel mutants isolated from a genetic screen in Drosophila melanogaster. To evaluate the impact of the Fly-CURE experience on students, we developed and validated assessment tools to identify students perceived research self-efficacy, sense of belonging in science, and intent to pursue additional research opportunities. Our data show gains in these metrics after completion of the Fly-CURE across all student subgroups analyzed, including comparisons of gender, academic status, racial and ethnic groups, and parents educational background. Importantly, our data also show differential gains in the areas of self-efficacy and interest in seeking additional research opportunities between Fly-CURE students with and without prior research experience, illustrating the positive impact of research exposure (dosage) on student outcomes. Altogether, our data indicate that the Fly-CURE experience has a significant impact on students efficacy with research methods, sense of belonging to the scientific community, and interest in pursuing additional research experiences."

M.",Marie M Phelan,2023-01-19,scientific communication and education,Disruption to teaching over the pandemic has led to a range of online and digital solutions. Given the utility of software and remote platforms for NMR teaching a UK-based survey for NMR educators in undergraduate and postgraduate teaching was rolled out Spring 2022 in order to establish what online tools and techniques are employed to teach NMR to biological sciences and appraise their relative efficacy. Based on the survey outcomes an overview of the breadth of methods employed as well as their perceived effectiveness is presented with a list of recommendations for common and successful strategies for online (and hybrid) teaching of NMR to the life sciences.

T.",Jonathan Thomas Pierce,2023-01-23,scientific communication and education,"Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) training can benefit STEM students. However, typical college settings often limit college students exposure to adult peers with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs), a historically marginalized group. To lower this barrier, we developed a continuing education program, Lifelong Learning with Friends (LLWF), aimed at adults with IDDs on a large university campus, which provides diversity training to college students. In this program, undergraduate and graduate students from scientific and education disciplines are recruited to volunteer as peers and helpers. LLWF has reached hundreds of students with and without IDDs each year and more than 1,500 over the past 12 years. In our program, college students gain DEI training through learning sophisticated academic topics, including sciences, alongside adults with IDDs. Almost half (42%) of surveyed LLWF college volunteers did not have prior exposure to people with IDDs. Following program participation, we found that, irrespective of prior exposure, nearly all (98%) of volunteers had elevated their expectations of people with IDDs and reported increased interest in IDDs-focused research, education, social interaction, and advocacy. Additionally, college volunteers reported that they improved their science communication by seeing how science could be taught to a broad audience that includes adults with IDDs. We therefore suggest that other universities may consider our LLWF model to enhance DEI training by expanding opportunities for neurotypical students to befriend and learn science alongside adults with IDDs."

Building off extant rubrics, the instructors designed project guidelines for a fully online plant collection experience to alleviate plant awareness disparity. Researchers collected stratified samples from the UGA iNaturalist project along with four other institutions projects to determine if rubrics and project guidelines could improve the quality of observations to make them useful in plant science research. The specific rubric was shown to improve quality of iNaturalist observations. Researchers found that iNaturalist increased engagement as a student-centered tool but did not enhance their manual keying skills as the app uses automatic identification. Instructors recommend continuing to use iNaturalist to supplement physical collection and keying along with a detailed rubric and guidelines for collection."

L.",Arturo Casadevall,2023-01-27,scientific communication and education,"In modern science, interdisciplinary and collaborative research is encouraged among scientists to solve complex problems. However, when the time comes to measure an individuals academic productivity, collaborative efforts are hard to conceptualize and quantify. In this study, we hypothesized that a social behavior coined ""scientific civility"", which encompasses civility, collaboration, cooperation, or a combination of these, enhances an individuals productivity influencing their academic performance. To facilitate recognition of this unique attribute within the scientific environment, we developed a new indicator: the C score. We examined publicly available data from 1000 academic scientists at the individual-level, focusing on their scholarly output and collaborative networks as a function of geographic distribution and time. Our findings strongly suggest that the C score gauges academic performance from an integral perspective based on a synergistic interaction between productivity and collaborative networks, prevailing over institutionally limited economic resources and minimizing inequalities related to the length of individuals academic career, field of investigation, and gender.

Author SummaryThe increased connectivity between fields and specialties of science is undeniable. We propose a new indicator, the C score, to assess the value of collaborative efforts and research output to a scientists academic performance. This indicator reflects collaborative and interdisciplinary efforts and provides a measure of ""scientific civility"" and teamwork. The C score may be used as a decision-making tool to track career advancement within the academic environment. Along with other indicators such as the h index, the C score supports a more integrative and holistic assessment of an individuals academic performance."

Botham,2023-01-27,scientific communication and education,"Time to degree completion is an important metric of academic progress and success for doctoral students. It is also a common way for educational stakeholders to compare programs even if the content of the degree programs varies. But what types of behaviors and experiences are associated with faster times to degree? In this education article, we examine the relationship between receiving competitive research awards (e.g. grant writing) and time to degree for PhD students. We organize our analyses by student identities, specifically gender and underrepresented minority (URM) status, to examine differences in time to degree based on student demographics. Our dataset included students that graduated between academic years 2008-09 through 2018-19. We also interviewed students currently enrolled in these same programs. We find that URM women who won competitive research awards graduate faster than all other students who also won awards but also report lower levels of advisor support. We also find that URM women and all URM students tended to graduate faster compared to other groups of students who did not win awards. Students who reported feeling supported by their advisors, most of which reflected hands-on guidance through the writing process, in the interviews were more likely to apply for grants. Combined, these results highlight that writing grants and specific types of advisor support may influence faster times to degree for bioscience PhD students. This study suggests similar introspective analyses at other institutions and databases are needed."

This award has two phases (K99 and R00) and provides funding for up to five years. Using NIH data for the period 2006-2022, we report that [~]230 K99 awards were made every year, representing up to [~]$250 million annual investment. About 40% of K99 awardees were women and [~]89% of K99 awardees went on to receive an R00 award annually. Institutions with the most NIH funding produced the most recipients of K99 awards and recruited the most recipients of R00 awards. The time between a researcher starting an R00 award and receiving a major NIH award (such as an R01) ranged between 4.6 and 7.4 years, and was significantly longer for women, for those who remained at their home institution, and for those hired by an institution that was not one of the 25 institutions with the most NIH funding. Shockingly, there has yet to be a K99 awardee at a historically Black college or university. We go on to show how K99 awardees flow to faculty positions, and to identify various factors that influence the future success of individual researchers and, therefore, also influence the composition of biomedical faculty at universities in the US."

Almost 2500 students completed surveys after finishing all their SEF competitions. We added a new question in 2019/20 to our on-going surveys asking the students whether their high school location was urban, suburban, or rural. We learned that overall, 74% of students participating in SEFs indicated that they were from suburban schools. Unexpectedly, very few SEF participants, less than 4%, indicated that they were from rural schools, even though national data show that more than 20% of high school students attend rural schools. Consistent with previous findings, Asian and Hispanic students indicated more successful SEF outcomes than Black and White students. However, whereas Asian students had the highest percentage of SEF participants from suburban vs. urban schools - 81% vs. 18%, Hispanic students had the most balanced representation of participants from suburban vs. urban schools - 55% vs. 39%. Differences in students SEF experiences based on gender and ethnicity showed the same patterns regardless of school location. In the few items where we observed statistically significant (probability <.05) differences based on school location, students from suburban schools were marginally favored by only a few percentage points compared to students from urban schools. In conclusion, based on our surveys results most students participating in SEFs come from suburban schools, but students participating in SEFs and coming from urban schools have equivalent SEF experiences, and very few students participating in SEFs come from rural schools."

This executive function is intensely engaged in music training while learning an instrument, a complex multisensory task requiring monitoring motor performance and auditory stream prioritization. This novel meta-analysis examined music-based training on inhibition control in children. Records from 1980 to 2023 yielded 22 longitudinal studies with controls (N = 1734), including 8 RCTs and 14 others. A random-effects meta-analysis showed that music training improved inhibition control (medium ES) in the RCTs and the superset of twenty-two longitudinal studies (small-to-medium ES). Music training plays a privileged role compared to other activities (sports, visual arts, drama) in improving childrens executive functioning, with a particular effect on inhibition control. We recommend music training for complementing education and as a clinical tool focusing on inhibition control remediation (e.g., in autism and ADHD)."

By identifying patterns within patent data resources, researchers can gain insight into the market trends and priorities of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, as well as provide additional perspectives on more fundamental aspects such as the emergence of potential new drug targets. In this paper, we used the patent enrichment tool, PEMT, to extract, integrate, and analyse patent literature for rare diseases (RD) and Alzheimers disease (AD). This is followed by a systematic review of the underlying patent landscape to decipher trends and applications in patents for these diseases. To do so, we discuss prominent organisations involved in drug discovery research in AD and RD. This allows us to gain an understanding of the importance of AD and RD from specific organisational (pharmaceutical or university) perspectives. Next, we analyse the historical focus of patents in relation to individual therapeutic targets and correlate them with market scenarios allowing the identification of prominent targets for a disease. Lastly, we identified drug repurposing activities within the two diseases with the help of patents. This resulted in identifying existing repurposed drugs and novel potential therapeutic approaches applicable to the indication areas. The study demonstrates the expanded applicability of patent documents from legal to drug discovery, design, and research, thus, providing a valuable resource for future drug discovery efforts. Moreover, this study is an attempt towards understanding the importance of data underlying patent documents and raising the need for preparing the data for machine learning-based applications."

There are multiple challenges in transforming a research project into a CURE, such as the readiness of students, the time commitment of the instructor, and the productivity of the research. In this article, we report a CURE course developed and offered in the University of Massachusetts Amherst BMB Department since 2018 that addresses these challenges. Our CURE focuses on fungal effectors which are proteins secreted by a destructive pathogenic fungus Fusarium oxysporum, one of the top five most devastating plant pathogens. By studying this group of proteins, students are connected to real-world problems and participate in the search for potential solutions. A three-week ""standard Bootcamp"" is implemented to help students familiarize themselves with all basic techniques and boost their confidence. Next, molecular cloning, a versatile technique with modularity and repeatability, is used as the bedrock of the course. Our past five years of experience have confirmed that we have developed a novel and feasible CURE protocol. Measurable progress documented by students who took this course includes stimulated active learning and increased career trajectory to pursue hypothesis-based research to address societal needs. In addition, data generated through the course advance ongoing lab research. Collectively, we encourage the implementation of CURE among research-intensive faculty to provide a more inclusive research experience to all students, an important element in predicting career success."

Findings indicate that career self-efficacy of non-citizen trainees is significantly lower than that of US citizen trainees. While lower career efficacy was observed in women compared with men, it was even lower for non-citizen female trainees. Results suggest that specific career interests may be related to career self-efficacy. Relative to US citizen trainees, both male and female non-citizen trainees showed higher interest in pursuing a career as an academic research investigator. In comparison with non-citizen female trainees and citizen trainees of all genders, non-citizen male trainees expressed the highest interest in research-intensive (and especially principal investigator) careers. The authors discuss potential causes for these results and offer recommendations for increasing trainee career self-efficacy which can be incorporated into graduate and postdoctoral training."

Our findings challenge the present stance of the mycological community - that ""the code"" works fine and that these complications will somehow sort themselves out given enough time and a following wind - and suggest that we should be discussing not whether to allow DNA-based descriptions (typifications) of species and by extension higher ranks of fungi, but what the precise requirements for such DNA-based typifications should be. We submit a tentative list of such criteria for further discussion. However, the present authors fear that no waves of change will be lapping the shores of mycology for the foreseeable future, leaving the overwhelming majority of extant fungi without formal names and thus scientific and environmental agency. It is not clear to us who benefits from that, but neither fungi nor mycology are likely to be on the winning side."

A.",Mike Schaller,2023-03-03,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundTraditionally, doctoral student education in the biomedical sciences relies on didactic coursework to build a foundation of scientific knowledge and an apprenticeship model of training in the laboratory of an established investigator. Recent recommendations for revision of graduate training include the utilization of graduate student competencies to assess progress and the introduction of novel curricula focused on development of skills, rather than accumulation of facts. Evidence demonstrates that active learning approaches are effective. Several facets of active learning are components of problem-based learning (PBL), which is a teaching modality where student learning is self-directed toward solving problems in a relevant context. These concepts were combined and incorporated in creating a new introductory graduate course designed to develop scientific skills (student competencies) in matriculating doctoral students using a PBL format.

MethodsEvaluation of course effectiveness was measured using the principals of the Kirkpatrick Four Level Model of Evaluation. At the end of each course offering, students completed evaluation surveys on the course and instructors to assess their perceptions of training effectiveness. Pre- and post-tests assessing students proficiency in experimental design were used to measure student learning.

ResultsThe analysis of the outcomes of the course suggests the training is effective in improving critical thinking in experimental design. The course was well received by the students as measured by student evaluations (Kirkpatrick Model Level 1). Improved scores on post-tests indicate that the students learned from the experience (Kirkpatrick Model Level 2).

M.; Richardson, W.",Kelsey M Watts,2023-03-06,scientific communication and education,"Women and non-white racial and ethnic groups remain underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). To achieve a more diverse and equitable STEM workforce, the recruitment and retention of these historically marginalized communities in postsecondary education will also need to increase. Recently, the lens has turned to pedagogy and how creating a more inclusive classroom environment can foster STEM identity in previously marginalized communities. This work focuses on developing and piloting systems biology education modules designed to promote an inclusive learning environment in a summer outreach program for high school students by (1) utilizing a hybrid of unplugged activities with coded simulation and (2) a female-oriented problem statement. Based on initial findings in our pilot program, we anticipate that these techniques will enable students with limited prior computational experience to feel more comfortable and able to complete tasks, thereby increasing their self-efficacy and STEM identity. These modules could be a valuable tool for practitioners teaching high school or early college-level computational courses who instruct students with varied coding experience. Additionally, our analysis of the use of a female-oriented problem statement on female-identifying students self-efficacy provides potential evidence of the usefulness of representative problem statements in engaging underrepresented student populations. We believe these techniques could be adapted to address a variety of contexts across STEM disciplines and other fields to foster inclusive learning environments."

While concerns exist about the potential citation boost in journals publishing these papers, the specifics are not fully understood. This study uses a generalized difference-in-differences approach to examine the impact of publishing COVID-19 papers on journal citation metrics in the Health Sciences fields. Findings indicate that journals publishing COVID-19 papers in 2020 received significantly higher citation premiums due to COVID-19 in 2020 and continued to benefit from the premium in 2021 in certain fields. In contrast, journals that began publishing COVID-19 papers in 2021 experienced weaker citation premiums. Although the publication volume of non-COVID-19 papers also surged, these papers experienced insignificant or negative citation gains, even when published in the same journals as COVID-19 papers. COVID-19 papers published in high-impact journals brought more significant citation premiums to journals in most fields. These citation premiums can affect various citation-based journal metrics, such as our simulated impact factor, to different degrees. The results highlight a ""gold rush"" pattern in which early entrants establish their citation advantage in research hotspots and caution against using citation-based metrics for research assessment."

However, the number of available berths to achieve the scientific goals of an expedition limits the number of onboard participants.

The 2021 iMirabilis2 expedition on board the Spanish Research Vessel Sarmiento de Gamboa used telepresence to virtually involve ECRs from several countries in deep-sea science. One year post-expedition, a survey of onshore participants was conducted to assess and quantify the effectiveness of the peer-to-peer ECR ship-to-shore scheme. During the expedition, live, interactive training via WhatsApp and Zoom was utilised by onshore ECRs more than traditional static, uni-directional methods of blog posts and pre-recorded videos. All respondents either agreed or strongly agreed that the scheme provided an inclusive and accessible platform to share deep-sea science. These results suggest similar schemes could be used to supplement shorter duration at-sea-training, used prior to a seagoing experience to better prepare ECRs, or to allow members of the science community unable to join an expedition in person to actively participate remotely, increasing inclusivity."

A.; Teal, T. K.; Woodley, L.",Jason J. Williams,2023-03-13,scientific communication and education,"Science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM) fields change rapidly and are increasingly interdisciplinary. Commonly, STEMM practitioners use short-format training (SFT) such as workshops and short courses for upskilling and reskilling, but unaddressed challenges limit SFTs effectiveness and inclusiveness. Prior work, including the NSF 2026 Reinventing Scientific Talent proposal, called for addressing SFT challenges, and a diverse international group of experts in education, accessibility, and life sciences came together to do so. This paper describes the phenomenography and content analyses that produced a set of 14 actionable recommendations to systematically strengthen SFT. Recommendations were derived from findings in the educational sciences and the experiences of several of the largest life science SFT programs. Recommendations cover the breadth of SFT contexts and stakeholder groups and include actions for instructors (e.g., make equity and inclusion an ethical obligation), programs (e.g., centralize infrastructure for assessment and evaluation), as well as organizations and funders (e.g., professionalize training SFT instructors; deploy SFT to counter inequity). Recommendations are aligned into a purpose-built framework-- ""The Bicycle Principles""--that prioritizes evidenced-based teaching, inclusiveness, and equity, as well as the ability to scale, share, and sustain SFT. We also describe how the Bicycle Principles and recommendations are consistent with educational change theories and can overcome systemic barriers to delivering consistently effective, inclusive, and career-spanning SFT.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSTEMM practitioners need sustained and customized professional development to keep up with innovations. Short-format training (SFT) such as workshops and short-courses are relied upon widely but have unaddressed limitations. This project generated principles and recommendations to make SFT consistently effective, inclusive, and career-spanning. Optimizing SFT could broaden participation in STEMM by preparing practitioners more equitably with transformative skills. Better SFT would also serve members of the STEMM workforce who have several decades of productivity ahead, but who may not benefit from education reforms that predominantly focus on undergraduate STEMM. The Bicycle Principles and accompanying recommendations apply to any SFT instruction and may be especially useful in rapidly evolving and multidisciplinary fields such as artificial intelligence, genomics, and precision medicine."

Guedes,2023-03-18,scientific communication and education,"Several metrics exists to evaluate the impact of publications and researchers, but most are based on citation counts, which usually fail to capture the temporal aspect of citations. Time to first citation represents a useful metric for research evaluation, and informs the speed at which scientific knowledge is disseminated through the scientific community. Understanding which factors affect such metrics is important as they impact resource allocation and career progression, besides influencing knowledge promotion across disciplines. Many ecological works rely on species identity, which is the  coin of taxonomy. Despite its importance, taxonomy is a discipline in crisis lacking staff, funds and prestige, which ultimately may affect the evaluation and dissemination of taxonomic works. We used a time-to-event analysis to investigate whether taxonomic, socioeconomic, and scientometric factors influence first citation speed across hundreds of ecological and taxonomic articles. Time to first citation differed greatly between these areas. Ecological studies were first cited much faster than taxonomic studies. Multitaxa articles received first citations earlier than studies focused on single major taxonomic groups. Article length and h-index among authors were negatively correlated with time to first citation, while the number of authors, number of countries, and Gross Domestic Product was unimportant. Knowledge dissemination is faster for lengthy, multitaxa, and ecological articles relative to their respective counterparts, as well as for articles with highly prolific authors. We stress that using several unrelated metrics is desirable when evaluating research from different-and even related-disciplines, particularly in the context of professional progression and grant allocation."

M.; Erickson, O. A.; Dolan, E. L.",Mariel A. Pfeifer,2023-03-24,scientific communication and education,"Background

Studying science identity development has been useful for understanding students continuation in science-related education and career paths. Yet, how science contexts shape students science identity development, especially as students engage in research at the undergraduate and graduate level, is still largely unexplored. Here we integrate science identity and professional identity theories to investigate how research training shapes science identity. We focus on a specialized form of science identity we call science researcher identity. We characterize how the features of an individuals research experience, and their personal characteristics interact to influence whether and how they see themselves as a science researcher. We accomplished this in two phases of qualitative research. First, we surveyed 548 undergraduate researchers about how their research experience influenced their identity as a scientist. Then we interviewed 30 early career researchers, including undergraduate, postbaccalaureate, and doctoral students, about their views of themselves as researchers and how elements of their research training shaped their views.

ResultsEarly career researchers (ECRs) viewed themselves as either science students or science researchers. How ECRs recognized themselves depended on how they viewed the purpose of their daily work and the extent to which they perceived autonomy and intellectual responsibility in their research. Individual-level factors, including research and researcher conceptions, research skill perceptions, and career intentions, influenced whether ECRs identified as science students or science researchers. ECRs also recognized themselves more or less as researchers based on contextual factors like the nature of their work, social interactions, and their perceptions of the norms within their research group and institution. ECRs considered how individual and contextual factors affected their science researcher identity through a lens we call  sense-making. We further detail the processes ECRs use to make sense of their science identity and the factors that influence it.

ConclusionsWe synthesized our findings to form a conceptual model of science researcher identity development, which hypothesizes relationships among constructs related to science identity and professional identity development. Our results advance theory related to science identity, offer avenues for future investigation, and inform efforts to promote science researcher identity development."

R.",Lauren Maggio,2023-03-24,scientific communication and education,"IntroductionInterdisciplinary research has been deemed to be critical in solving societys wicked problems, including those relevant to medical education. Medical education research has been assumed to be interdisciplinary. However, researchers have questioned this assumption. The present study, a conceptual replication, provides an analysis using a larger dataset and bibliometric methods to bring more clarity to our understanding on the nature of medical education interdisciplinarity or lack thereof.

MethodThe authors retrieved the cited references of all published articles in 24 medical education journals between 2001-2020 from the Web of Science (WoS). We then identified the WoS classifications for the journals of each cited reference.

ResultsThe 24 journals published 31,283 articles referencing 723,683 publications. We identified 493,973 (68.3%) of those cited references in 6,618 journals representing 242 categories, which represents 94% of all WoS categories. Close to half of all citations were categorized as ""education, scientific disciplines"" and ""healthcare sciences and services"". Over the two decades studied, we observed consistent growth in the number of references in other categories, such as education, educational research, and nursing. Additionally, the variety of categories represented has also increased from 182 to 233 to include a diversity of topics such as business, management, and linguistics.

DiscussionThis study corroborates prior work while also expanding it. Medical education research is built upon a limited range of fields referenced. Yet, the growth in categories over time and the ongoing increased diversity of included categories suggests interdisciplinarity that until now has yet to be recognized and represents a changing story."

The power of the printers lies in the democratisation of scientific equipment. Traditional agarose gel electrophoresis forms a cornerstone of molecular biology research, teaching and learning. Reliable electrophoresis is dependent on a number of factors which include standardized commercial equipment with respect to casting trays, combs, horizontal tanks and power supplies. The aforementioned systems come at a high initial cost; this is before factoring in the costs of standard electrophoresis grade agarose and associated reagent pricing. Here, we present a basic method for the additive manufacturing of a simple 3D printable agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE) unit with a built-in gel casting tray for standard size microscope slide-based AGE; named AG3D. The system presented was validated using different standard agarose-buffers (Tris Acetate EDTA and Tris Borate EDTA) and commercially available base-pair ladders. We provide a comparison between the AG3D and a commercial AGE system in respect to resolving power of the electrophoresis unit and discuss the overall reduction in cost afforded by the AG3D electrophoresis toolkit.

Although these diseases individually affect small number of people, together they affect 400 million people globally at any given time. In India, where resources are scarce, healthcare infrastructure and policy framework are focused on mitigating diseases that affect many people. Further, the level of RD awareness among healthcare professionals, researchers, and general public is considerably low. As a result, many cases of RDs remain unreported, undiagnosed, and untreated. To frame policies regarding RDs, it is crucial to understand the current level of RD awareness among healthcare professional and researchers, as they are key stakeholders in diagnosis, treatment, policy making, and drug development. We conducted an exploratory survey to understand the current level of RD awareness among healthcare professionals and researchers based on identification of an RD, time for diagnosis, treatment options, and relationship with family history and geographic location. We noted that our respondents have considerably low level of RD awareness. They correctly identified the importance of family history but failed to realize the association with geographic location. After presenting the survey findings, we have made recommendation to improve RD awareness in India. Our findings will be helpful to design awareness campaigns and frame relevant policies."

Air travel and attendance to conferences concentrate recent data and debates but purchases have attracted little attention. Here we develop a hybrid method to estimate the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) associated to research purchases. To do so, we combine macroe-conomic databases, research-centered companies footprints and life-cycle assesments to construct a public database of monetary emission factors (EF) for research purchases. We apply it to estimate the purchases emissions of a hundred of research laboratories in France, belonging to the Labos 1point5 network and gathering more than 20000 staff, from all disciplines. We find that purchases dominate laboratory emissions, accounting for more than 50% of emissions, with a median of 2.7 t CO2e/pers, which is 3 to 4-fold the separate contribution from travel, commutes and heating. Median electricity emissions are 5-fold lower in our dataset of laboratories using low carbon electricity but they become preponderant for high carbon electricity mixes (3.5 t CO2e/pers). Purchases emissions are very heterogeneous among laboratories and are linearly correlated with budget, with an average carbon intensity of 0.31 {+/-} 0.07 kg CO2e/{euro} and differences between research domains. Finally, we quantify the effect of a series of demand-driven mitigation strategies obtaining up to -20 % in total emissions (-40 % in purchases emissions), suggesting that effectively reducing the carbon footprint of research activities calls for systemic changes.

Significance statementResearch activities are recently interrogating their contribution to global warming, mainly through the impact of air travel but neglecting the emissions embodied in scientific purchases. However, goods and services used in a research laboratory emit greenhouse gases when they are produced. Here we construct a public and robust database of emission factors to quantify purchases emissions in a laboratory and we use it to assess emissions from a hundred of laboratories in France, from all disciplines. We find that purchases emissions represent half of the of the 6.3 t CO2e/pers per year emitted on average per laboratory. Emissions, however, vary greatly between laboratories and disciplines and an analysis of mitigation strategies shows that decreasing demand may significantly reduce purchases emissions."

P.; Fleerackers, A.; Riedlinger, M.; Haustein, S.",Juan Pablo Alperin,2023-04-06,scientific communication and education,"The potential to capture the societal impact of research has been a driving motivation for the use and development of altmetrics. Yet, to date, altmetrics have largely failed to deliver on this potential because the primary audience who cites research on social media has been shown to be academics themselves. In response, our study investigates an extension of traditional altmetric approaches that goes beyond capturing direct mentions of research on social media. Using research articles from the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic as a case study, we demonstrate the value of measuring  second-order citations, or social media mentions of news coverage of research. We find that a sample of these citations, published by just five media outlets, were shared and engaged with on social media twice as much as the research articles themselves. Moreover, first-order and second-order citations circulated among Twitter accounts and Facebook accounts that were largely distinct from each other. The differences in audiences and engagement patterns found in this case study highlight the importance of news coverage as a public source of science information and provide strong evidence that investigating these second-order citations can be an effective way of observing non-academic audiences that engage with research content."

The almost instantaneous success of LLMs stimulated lively discussions in public media and in academic fora alike on the value and potentials of such tools in all areas of knowledge and information acquisition and distribution, but also about the dangers posed by their uncontrolled and indiscriminate use. This conversation is now particularly active in the higher education sector, where LLMs are seen as a potential threat to academic integrity at all levels, from facilitating cheating by students in assignments, to plagiarising academic writing in the case of researchers and administrators. Within this framework, we were interested in testing the boundaries of the LLM ChatGPT (www.openai.com) in areas of our scientific interest and expertise, and in analysing the results from different perspectives, i.e. of a final year BSc student, of a research scientist, and of a lecturer in higher education. To this end, in this paper we present and discuss a systematic evaluation on how ChatGPT addresses progressively complex scientific writing tasks and exam-type questions in Carbohydrate Chemistry and Glycobiology. The results of this project allowed us to gain insight on, 1) the strengths and limitations of the ChatGPT model to provide relevant and (most importantly) correct scientific information, 2) the format(s) and complexity of the query required to obtain the desired output, and 3) strategies to integrate LLMs in teaching and learning."

We demonstrate the same phenomenon for biomedical knowledge when promising research receives inflated attention. We predict deflationary events by developing a diffusion index that captures whether research areas have been amplified within social and scientific bubbles or have diffused and become evaluated more broadly. We illustrate our diffusion approach contrasting the trajectories of cardiac stem cell research and cancer immunotherapy. We then trace the diffusion of unique 28,504 subfields in biomedicine comprising nearly 1.9M papers and more than 80M citations and demonstrate that limited diffusion of biomedical knowledge anticipates abrupt decreases in popularity. Our analysis emphasizes that restricted diffusion, implying a socio-epistemic bubble, leads to dramatic collapses in relevance and attention accorded to scientific knowledge."

Both classroom and experiential training opportunities are essential to achieving this goal. In this publication, we assessed the current landscape of science policy training for undergraduate students in the United States by conducting a keyword search for experiential career training opportunities at varying levels of education. We also reviewed existing science policy publications for undergraduate opportunities, an area that has been largely unexplored to date. From these assessments, we found that most experiential training opportunities are geared towards Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) students in PhDs program or recent PhD graduates, followed by Masters-level students or graduates, and fewer opportunities exist for undergraduate students and Bachelor-degree holders. We then conducted focus group-style interviews with early career scientists involved in science policy, including undergraduate students, to discuss their experiences and ideas for change. Based on our findings, we recommend that universities, organizations, and funding agencies expand upon their existing resources for curriculum, academic advising, training opportunities, and funding, and dedicate resources toward raising awareness and creating additional opportunities in science policy at the undergraduate level. These steps can help create pathways for undergraduate students to enter and contribute to the science policy workforce."

Peer reviewers are often prompted by journals to examine whether references listed in the manuscript under review are unbiased, but there is no consensus on what is considered ""excessive"" self-referencing. Here, self-referencing rates are estimated across multiple journals in the fields of biology, genetics, computational biology, medicine, pathology, and cell biology. Median self-referencing rates are between 8-13% across a range of journals within these subdisciplines. However, self-referencing rates vary as a function of total number of references, number of authors, author status/rank, author position, and total number publications for each author. These results may serve as useful statistical guidelines for authors, editors, reviewers, and journals when considering referencing practices for individual publications."

Ioannidis,2023-04-24,scientific communication and education,"Social media platforms have an increasing influence in biomedical and other disciplines of science and public health. While Twitter has been a popular platform for scientific communication, changes in ownership have led some users to consider migrating to other platforms such as Mastodon. We aimed to investigate how many top-cited scientists are active on these social media platforms, the magnitude of the migration to Mastodon, and correlates of Twitter presence. A random sample of 900 authors was examined among those who are at the top-2% of impact based on a previously validated composite citation indicator using Scopus data. Searches for their personal Twitter accounts were performed in early December 2022, and re-evaluations were performed at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 2 months (February 6, 2023). 262/900 (29.1%) of highly-cited scholars had Twitter accounts, and only 9/800 (1%) had Mastodon accounts. Female gender, North American and Australia locations, younger publication age, and clinical medicine or social science expertise correlated with higher percentages of Twitter use. The vast majority of highly-cited author users of Twitter had few followers and tweets. Only 6 had more than 10,000 followers and none had more than 100,000. One limitation of our study is that it is possible that some accounts, especially with Mastodon, could not be detected. However, the study suggests that Twitter remains the preferred social media platform for highly-cited authors, and Mastodon has not yet challenged Twitters dominance. Moreover, most highly-cited scientists with Twitter accounts have limited presence in this medium."

B.; Sa-Pinto, X.",Patrícia Pessoa,2023-04-28,scientific communication and education,"On the edge of causing the sixth big mass extinction event, the development of positive attitudes towards the conservation of intraspecific diversity from early ages is essential to overcome the biodiversity crisis we currently face. However, there is no information available on elementary school students attitudes toward intraspecific diversity conservation nor is there a framework available to perform such analysis. For this study we designed, implemented, and evaluated an educational activity planned for third graders (8 to 13 years old) to explore the intraspecific diversity of vegetables and to promote healthy eating habits. Additionally, a framework was developed to evaluate students attitudes towards intraspecific diversity conservation and applied to semi-structured interviews conducted with students before and after engaging in the educational activity. In this paper we present a reliable framework, developed aligned with the ABC model of attitudes, based on literature, and adapted to elementary school students responses, to evaluate students attitudes toward intraspecific diversity. Our results show that, before the educational activity, most students choose a non-biodiverse option, justifying this choice with the affective component of attitudes: mostly emotional factors but also aesthetic and social/cultural factors. After the educational activity, we observed a significant increase in the frequency of students that choose the biodiverse option and that justified it with the cognitive component of attitudes: mainly with biology and health knowledge factors, but also with economic and ethical knowledge factors. Our findings support the positive impact of educational activities that explore vegetable varieties on students attitudes toward intraspecific diversity conservation."

Here, we demonstrate the use of lab-on-a-chip (LoC) technologies to train Latinx life science undergraduate students in concepts of computer programming by taking advantage of open-loop cloud-integrated LoCs. We developed a context-aware curriculum to train students at over 8,000 km from the experimental site. We showed that this approach was sufficient to develop programming skills and increase the interest of students in continuing careers in Bioinformatics. Altogether, we conclude that LoC-based Internet-enabled PBL can become a powerful tool to train Latinx students and increase the diversity in STEM."

Interest and feasibility of direct funding mechanisms,"Dufour, Q.; Pontille, D.; Torny, D.",Didier Torny,2023-05-04,scientific communication and education,"More and more academics and governements consider that the open access model based on Article Processing Charges (APC) is problematic, not only due to the inequalities it generates and reinforces, but also because it has become unsustainable and even opposed to open access values. They consider that scientific publishing based on a model where both authors and readers do not pay - the so-called Diamond, or non-APC model - should be developed and supported. However, beyond the display of such a support on an international scale, the landscape of Diamond journals is rather in the form of loosely connected archipelagos, and not systematically funded. This article explores the practical conditions to implement a direct funding mechanism to such journals, that is reccurent money provided by a funder to support the publication process. Following several recommendations from institutional actors in the open access world, we consider the hypothesis that such a funding would be fostered by research funding organizations (RFOs), which have been essential to the expansion of the APC model, and now show interest in supporting other models. Based on a questionnaire survey sent to more thant 1000 Diamond Open Access journals, this article analyzes their financial needs, as well as their capacity to interact with funders. It is structured around four issues regarding the implementation of a direct funding model : Do Diamond journals really make use of money, and to what end ? Do they need additional money? Are they able to engage monetary transactions? Are they able to meet RFOs visibility requirements? We show that a majority of OA Diamond journals could make use of a direct funding mechanism with certain adjustments. We conclude on the challenges that such a financial stream would spur."

However, the quality of mentorship received by trainees can vary by investigator and by institution. One challenge faced by those hoping to improve trainee mentorship is that the extent to which mentorship is offered to and experienced by research trainees is not well characterized. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a survey to examine the quality of mentorship received by trainees in research environments, to identify characteristics of positive and negative mentorship, and to highlight best practices to improve trainee mentorship. We received 2,114 responses from researchers at graduate and postdoctoral career stages worldwide. Quantitative analysis showed that at least [~]25-45% of respondents were dissatisfied with some aspects of their mentorship. Qualitative responses revealed that common issues in mentorship include unclear expectations in research and mentoring interactions, lack of guidance, and inadequate support of trainee independence and career goals. Our findings also identified key mentorship elements desired by trainee mentees. Based on trainee suggestions, we describe strategies for individual mentors, departments, and institutions to improve the training experience for graduate and postdoctoral researchers."

We learned that alumni had low confidence and expectations of success in STEM as community college students. Participation in CCI increased their professional networks, expectations of success, and STEM skills, identity, and self-efficacy/confidence. Hispanic/Latinx alumni recalled the positive impact of mentors who prioritized personal connections, and women valued ""warm"" social environments. We propose several additions to the SCCT model, to better reflect the supports and barriers to STEM persistence for community college students."

We compare the accessibility of COVID-19 content versus SDG literature using the Dimensions database between 2000 and 2021, classifying each publication as gold open access, green, bronze, hybrid, or closed. We found that 79.9% of COVID-19 research papers published between January 2020 and December 2021 was open access, with 39.0% published with gold open access licenses. In contrast, just 55.7% of SDG papers were open access in the same time period, with only 36.0% published with gold open access licenses. Papers related to the climate emergency overall had the second-lowest level of open access at just 55.5%. Papers published by the largest for-profit publishers that committed to both the SDG Publishers Compact and climate actions were not predominantly published open access. The paper highlights the need for continued efforts to promote open access publishing to facilitate scientific research and technological development to address global challenges.

10.1101/2023.05.22.541679,Systematic literature review about educational interventions evaluated through entomological indices or practices to prevent the presence of or eliminate breeding sites of Aedes,"Soria, C.; Almiron, W. R.; Stewart-Ibarra, A. M.; Crocco, L. B.",Carola Soria,2023-05-23,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundCommunity participation is a critical element in the management of Aedes breeding sites. Many educational interventions have been conducted to encourage prevention and elimination of breeding sites among different community actors, such as government-run programs for vector surveillance aimed at preventing and eliminating breeding sites at the household level within a community. Getting people involved in prevention and elimination of vector breeding sites in their communities requires communication and social mobilization strategies to promote and reinforce those prevention actions that, in turn, should be effective from the entomological standpoint.

Methodology/Principal FindingsArticles published in English, Spanish, and Portuguese, were reviewed to assess whether educational interventions targeting Aedes were effective in reducing entomological indicators or in improving practices to prevent the presence of or eliminate breeding sites. The most widely used indicators were the larval indices, and the practices to reduce/eliminate breeding sites. We found that using a community-based approach adapted to the eco-epidemiological and sociocultural scenarios explain the reduction of entomological indicators by educational interventions.

Conclusions/SignificanceThose who design or implement educational interventions should strengthen the evaluation of those interventions using qualitative approaches that provide a more complete picture of the social context and barriers/facilitators to implementing vector control. Engaging school children in cross-sectorial collaboration involving the health and education spheres promotes the participation of the community in vector surveillance and reduces the risk of arboviral disease transmission.

Author summaryDengue, Zika, and chikungunya are mosquito-borne diseases that represent a major global public health problem. These diseases are transmitted mainly through the bite of the Aedes aegypti vector mosquito and, to a lesser extent, Ae. albopictus. Getting people involved in prevention and elimination of mosquitos in their communities requires communication and social mobilization strategies to promote and reinforce those prevention actions that, in turn, should be effective from the entomological standpoint. The success of vector control programs has been demonstrated to lie in a comprehensive effort involving key community participation and intersectoral alliances. In addition, the participation of schoolchildren to mobilize their families in the prevention of breeding sites and the management of mosquito populations is recommended. In this article, we proposed to conduct a systematic review of scientific publications that evaluate the effects of educational interventions on Aedes through entomological indicators. As a result, we obtained only 26 articles that evaluated the efficacy of educational interventions in reducing vector populations out of 732 articles reviewed. The selected articles were published in both English and Spanish, and to a lesser extent in Portuguese, which highlights the importance of avoiding language bias in systematic reviews. As a conclusion of our work, we can mention that the interventions that incorporated the social context and the barriers/facilitators for the implementation of vector control were the most successful. In addition, we emphasize the importance of involving schoolchildren to promote community participation in vector surveillance."

Experimental studies have identified several of these genes and pathways that that can extend or shorten an individuals lifespan. Understanding these genes and pathways can help develop interventions that improve health and quality of life of older people. Nonetheless, as the global population continues to age, it is essential to comprehend the ageing processs impact on society. Functional age is defined as a combination of chronological, biological, and psychological ages. An educational course called ""Functional Ageing"" was created for life science students at the National University of Singapore (NUS) during the academic year 2016-2017. The module adopted an interdisciplinary approach based on science-technology-society (STS) methodology and aimed to equip students with the analytical tools needed to assess the ageing process at both the molecular and physiological/functional levels. Ultimately, the module aimed to promote the understanding of ageing processes, particularly functional ageing in a population and its societal impacts.

MethodsThis ""Functional Ageing"" course spanned over 13 weeks, consisting of weekly four-hour sessions that aimed to integrate both biology of ageing and societal perceptions of an ageing population. The first half of the semester covered the molecular processes that govern ageing, while the second half focussed on societal perception, burden of disease, healthy ageing interventions and creating an ageless society. Experimental and epidemiological studies were used to explain the ageing process. Expert guest lecturers were invited throughout the module to share their experiences on the demanding research areas of ageing today, as well as clinical aspects of age-related diseases. In addition, a field visit to a geriatric ward at the mental health organisation was arranged to showcase the countrys approach to dealing with the rising demands of ageing, and to provide experiential learning that can help inculcate a clearer public perception of ageing.

ResultsThis 13-week module helped to improve students perception about functional ageing in todays society. After the module, a reflection analysis was conducted to evaluate students perceptions of ageing society. Overall findings garnered have demonstrated that while students generally have a brief understanding of the biological processes of ageing, their perception on how ageing is being manifested in a public health and societal setting is in paucity. However, the routine university-directed feedback survey indicated that the module had a positive impact on students appreciation and comprehension of the interplay between biological and sociological aspects of ageing, thus achieving the learning objectives of the module.

ConclusionThe aim of the ""Functional ageing"" module was to integrate the biology and sociology of ageing to provide a better interdisciplinary understanding of ageing in society. After completing the module, students demonstrated a change in their mindset and attitude towards how their scientific understanding of ageing can be coupled to their public perception of ageing. As ageing populations become more prevalent in many societies, it is crucial that we prepare for an ageing population and develop a positive perception of ageing. Through educational efforts like this course/module, students will exhibit greater awareness of ageing issues, leading to more informed and balanced perceptions."

A.; Baas, J.",John Ioannidis,2023-05-26,scientific communication and education,"We evaluated how the gender composition of top-cited authors within different subfields of research has evolved over time. We considered 9,071,122 authors with at least 5 full papers in Scopus as of September 1, 2022. Using a previously validated composite citation indicator, we identified the 2% top-cited authors for each of 174 science subfields (Science-Metrix classification) in 4 separate publication age cohorts (first publication pre-1992, 1992-2001, 2002-2011, post-2011). Using NamSor we assigned 3,784,507 authors as men, and 2,011,616 as women (for 36.1% gender assignment uncertain). Men outnumbered women 1.88-fold among all authors, decreasing from 3.93-fold to 1.36-fold over time. Men outnumbered women 3.21-fold among top-cited authors, decreasing from 6.41-fold to 2.28-fold over time. In the youngest (post-2011) cohort, 32/174 (18%) subfields had >=50% women, 97/174 (56%) subfields had >=30% women, and 3 subfields had =<10% women among the top-cited authors. Gender imbalances in author numbers decreased sharply over time in both high-income countries (including the USA) and other countries, but the latter had little improvement in gender imbalances for top-cited authors. In random samples of 100 women and 100 men from the youngest (post-2011) cohort, in-depth assessment showed that most were currently (April 2023) working in academic environments. 32 women and 44 men had some faculty appointment, but only 2 women and 2 men were full professors. Our analysis shows large heterogeneity across scientific disciplines in the amelioration of gender imbalances with more prominent imbalances persisting among top-cited authors and slow promotion pathways even for the most-cited young scientists."

ObjectivesThis study intended to reveal the degree of knowledge, attitudes, and biosecurity practices among Sylhet district, Bangladeshs small-scale dairy farmers. We also focused on the association between biosecurity practices and the incidence of non-specific enteritis in humans.

MethodsA questionnaire-based survey was conducted on the farmers KAP via personal interviews of 15 farmers from the randomly selected fifteen small-scale dairy farms. The questionnaire was developed with six questions for knowledge, six questions for attitude, and 12 questions for the practice of biosecurity measures. Alongside that, data on the number of non-specific enteritis cases experienced by the farmers or their family members were also recorded. Spearman correlation was used to find out the correlation among KAP variables and between practice scores and non-specific enteritis incidences.

ResultsWe found an insignificant (p > 0.05) influence of demographic characteristics over knowledge, attitude, and biosecurity practices. Significant (p<0.05) and strong correlations were found in knowledge-attitude (r = 0.65), knowledge-practice (r = 0.71), and attitude-practice (r = 0.64). Incidences of non-specific enteritis and biosecurity measures practice were also strongly correlated (r = -0.9232) and statistically significant (p<0.05).

ConclusionsOur study suggests that increasing knowledge and developing a good attitude are necessary to increase the adaptation of biosecurity measures as three of these factors are correlated. Also, farm biosecurity measures are closely related to human health."

Carlson,2023-05-31,scientific communication and education,"EXECUTIVE SUMMARYO_ST_ABSBACKGROUNDC_ST_ABSCougars (Puma concolor), also known as mountain lions, pumas, catamounts, and Florida panthers, once ranged widely throughout the United States (McCollough, 2011). Following intensive human persecution, anthropogenic-driven habitat loss, and unrestricted hunting of the prey species upon which cougars depend, populations were extirpated from much of the country (Cardoza & Langolis, 2002). In the northeastern U.S. specifically, cougars were functionally extinct by the early 1900s. Recent research assessing potential habitat for cougars suggests numerous areas exist to restore the species throughout portions of their historic eastern range (Winkel et al., 2022; Yovovich et al., 2023). But are the humans inhabiting this region today supportive of cougar restoration?

STUDY OBJECTIVESThe primary goal of this study was to make a preliminary assessment of support for cougar restoration at the state level in several states deemed to have substantial habitat for cougars (i.e., Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont, and West Virginia). Additionally, we sought to identify individual-level correlates of support for, and opposition to, cougar restoration.

STUDY FINDINGSResults from an online survey of residents of seven eastern states with potential cougar habitat (n=2756) suggest that support for cougar restoration is much higher than opposition to cougar restoration. Ratios of strong support to strong opposition range from approximately 4:1 to 13:1. Maine has the highest ratio of strong support to strong opposition at 13:1, indicating that for every one person opposing cougar restoration in the state, we can expect 13 people to support it. Vermont and New Hampshire have the second highest ratio of strong support to strong opposition at 12:1 each. New York and Massachusetts have the second lowest ratio of strong support to strong opposition, at 5:1 each. West Virginia and Pennsylvania have the lowest ratio of strong support to strong opposition with ratios of 4:1, indicating that for every one person opposing cougar restoration in these states, we can expect 4 people to support it. Results also reveal that states with the lowest ratio of strong support to strong opposition tend to have the highest proportion of respondents expressing neutrality toward the idea of restoration.

At the individual-level, support for cougar restoration was higher among men, respondents identifying ""strongly"" or ""very strongly"" as a hunter or a conservationist, those with mutualist wildlife value orientations, urban residents, and respondents identifying as politically liberal.

IMPLICATIONSGiven the current structure of wildlife management in the U.S., efforts to restore cougars throughout significant portions of their historic range will depend in large part on actions taken by state wildlife management agencies. Finding support for cougar restoration among many of the constituents for whom state wildlife agencies are expected to operate on behalf of - including both hunters and conservationists - this study offers valuable insights regarding the social feasibility of restoring cougars to the eastern U.S.

Importantly, while a majority of respondents were supportive of cougar restoration, a considerable portion of the population in each state expressed neutrality toward the idea of cougar restoration. Extant research from the behavioral sciences suggests these individuals may be more likely to change their attitudes toward cougar restoration in response to new information. Whether any such change would result in greater support or greater opposition toward cougar restoration is likely dependent on several factors, including the way in which information regarding the potential risks and benefits of the species is presented (Slagle et al., 2013), as well as the source/messenger from which new information is provided (e.g., Fielding et al., 2020).

Through multi-choice and open-ended questions, the survey inquired about demographics, image analysis experiences, future needs, and suggestions on the role of tool developers and users. Participants of the survey were from diverse roles and domains of the life and physical sciences. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to survey cross-community to bridge knowledge gaps between physical and life sciences imaging. Survey results indicate that respondents overarching needs are documentation, detailed tutorials on the usage of image analysis tools, user-friendly intuitive software, and better solutions for segmentation, ideally in a format tailored to their specific use cases. The tool creators suggested the users familiarize themselves with the fundamentals of image analysis, provide constant feedback, and report the issues faced during image analysis while the users would like more documentation and an emphasis on tool friendliness. Regardless of the computational experience, there is a strong preference for  written tutorials to acquire knowledge on image analysis. We also observed that the interest in having  office hours to get an expert opinion on their image analysis methods has increased over the years. In addition, the community suggests the need for a common repository for the available image analysis tools and their applications. The opinions and suggestions of the community, released here in full, will help the image analysis tool creation and education communities to design and deliver the resources accordingly."

F.",Pierre F Baldi,2023-06-12,scientific communication and education,"ObjectiveThis study aims to evaluate the capabilities and limitations of three large language models (LLMs) - GPT-3, GPT-4, and Bard, in the field of pharmaceutical sciences by assessing their pharmaceutical reasoning abilities on a sample North American Pharmacist Licensure Examination (NAPLEX). We also analyze the potential impacts of LLMs on pharmaceutical education and practice.

MethodsA sample NAPLEX exam consisting of 137 multiple-choice questions was obtained from an online source. GPT-3, GPT-4, and Bard were used to answer the questions by inputting them into the LLMs user interface. The answers provided by the LLMs were then compared with the answer key.

ResultsGPT-4 exhibited superior performance compared to GPT-3 and Bard, answering 78.8% of the questions correctly. This score was 11% higher than Bard and 27.7% higher than GPT-3. However, when considering questions that required multiple selections, the performance of each LLM decreased significantly. GPT-4, GPT-3, and Bard only correctly answered 53.6%, 13.9%, and 21.4% of these questions, respectively.

ConclusionAmong the three LLMs evaluated, GPT-4 was the only model capable of passing the NAPLEX exam. Nevertheless, given the continuous evolution of LLMs, it is reasonable to anticipate that future models will effortlessly pass the exam. This highlights the significant potential of LLMs to impact the pharmaceutical field. Hence, we must evaluate both the positive and negative implications associated with the integration of LLMs in pharmaceutical education and practice."

The sustained high pressure of a pandemic on responders, such as healthcare workers, can lead to lasting psychological impacts including acute stress disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, burnout, and moral injury, which can impact individual wellbeing and productivity. As members of the infectious disease modelling community, we convened a reflective workshop to understand the professional and personal impacts of response work on our community and to propose recommendations for future epidemic responses. The attendees represented a range of career stages, institutions, and disciplines. This piece was collectively produced by those present at the session based on our collective experiences. Key issues we identified at the workshop were lack of institutional support, insecure contracts, unequal credit and recognition, and mental health impacts. Our recommendations include rewarding impactful work, fostering academia-public health collaboration, decreasing dependence on key individuals by developing teams, increasing transparency in decision-making, and implementing sustainable work practices. Despite limitations in representation, this workshop provided valuable insights into the UK COVID-19 modelling experience and guidance for future public health crises.

J.",Elizabeth J Rideout,2023-06-14,scientific communication and education,"Sex differences exist in the risk of developing both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and in the risk of developing diabetes-associated complications. Sex differences in glucose homeostasis, islet and {beta} cell biology, and peripheral insulin sensitivity have also been reported in multiple animals. To determine the degree to which biological sex has been addressed in published literature related to diabetes and insulin biology, we developed a scoring system to assess the inclusion of biological sex in papers related to these topics. We scored manuscripts published in Diabetes, published by the American Diabetes Association, as this journal focuses on diabetes and diabetes-related research. We scored papers published across three years within a 20-year period (1999, 2009, 2019), a timeframe that spans the introduction of funding agency and journal policies to improve the consideration of biological sex as a variable. Our analysis shows fewer than 15% of papers used sex-based analysis in even one figure across all study years, a trend that was reproduced across journal-defined categories of diabetes research (e.g., islet studies, signal transduction). Single-sex studies accounted for approximately 40% of all manuscripts, of which >87% used male subjects only. While we observed a modest increase in the overall inclusion of sex as a biological variable during our study period, our results highlight significant opportunities to improve consideration of sex as a biological variable in diabetes research. In particular, we show that journal policies represent one way to promote better consideration of biological sex as a variable. In the long term, improved practices will reveal sex-specific mechanisms underlying diabetes risk and complications, generating insights to support the development of sex-informed prevention and treatment strategies."

Yet the mechanisms by which CUREs contribute to student integration and persistence are poorly understood. Utilizing the Tripartite Integration Model of Social Influence (TIMSI), this longitudinal study examines how Tiny Earth, an antibiotic-discovery CURE, impacts students scientific self-efficacy, scientific identity, endorsement of scientific community values, and intentions to persist in science. The study also explores how gains in TIMSI factors vary as a function of student demographics and course characteristics. Results of pre-and post-course measurements show that scientific self-efficacy and identity increased among students in Tiny Earth, and some student demographics and course characteristics moderated these gains. Gains in scientific self-efficacy, identity, and values correlated with gains in persistence intentions, whereas student demographics and course characteristics did not. Results of this study show that the Tiny Earth CURE enhanced students integration into the scientific community, which was linked to intentions of students of both historically underrepresented and majority groups to persist in STEM. We discuss how courses that provide opportunity to learn science skills in the context of a CURE can contribute toward enlarging and diversifying the STEM workforce."

To address this problem, 1LocusSim was developed to simulate the interaction of different factors, such as population size, mutation, selection, and dominance, to study their effect on allelic frequency during evolution. With 1LocusSim, students can compare theoretical results with simulation outputs and solve and analyze different problems of population genetics. The 1LocusSim web has a responsive design which means that it has been specifically designed to be used on smartphones. To demonstrate its use, I review the classical overdominance model of population genetics and highlight a characteristic that is often not explicitly stated. Specifically, it is emphasized that the equilibrium of the model does not depend on the homozygous selection coefficients but rather on the ratio of the selection coefficients. This is already clear from the classical formula but maybe not so much for students. Also it implies that the equilibrium can be expressed solely in terms of the dominance coefficient h. To verify these theoretical prediction, I utilize the simulator and calculate the equilibrium for the well-known case of sickle cell anaemia.

Simulating basic population genetic models on smartphones can be a powerful learning aid that fosters critical skills and opens up new opportunities for Biology students. By utilizing this tool, students can learn at their own pace and convenience, anywhere and anytime.

C.; Flores-Payan, V.",Abril Adriana Angulo-Sherman,2023-06-30,scientific communication and education,"The term biomass may be used in different contexts, one of which is related to energy production from biomass sources, especially wastes. Mexico is considered a country with a high potential to exploit renewable energy sources, particularly biomass. Still, according to studies about energy consumption in Mexican homes, biomass is one of the least used, compared to conventional sources or even other renewable sources. It is not understood how aware the countrys population is of the potential of biomass, or if they recognize it as a renewable energy source. This study presents a pilot survey performed on a small adult population that has or is receiving professional education and designed to identify how biomass is perceived among other renewable energy sources and whether the population considers it relevant to inform themselves about this topic. The results obtained indicate that people recognize mostly wind (99%) and solar (88%) power, but when it comes to biomass only 36% of the population knows energy may be obtained from it. When it comes to its use only 5.8% of the population indicates using it. Besides understanding the populations perception these results may help to develop more educational policies about renewable energies by universities."

I.; Hibbert, B.; Moher, D.",Kelly D Cobey,2023-07-03,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundOpen science is a movement and set of practices to conduct research more transparently. Implementing open science will significantly improve public access and supports equity. It also has the potential to foster innovation and reduce duplication through data and materials sharing. Here, we survey an international group of researchers publishing in cardiovascular journals regarding their perceptions and practices related to open science.

MethodsWe identified the top 100 ""Cardiology and Cardiovascular Medicine"" subject category journals from the SCImago journal ranking platform. This is a publicly available portal that draws from Scopus. We then extracted the corresponding authors name and e-mail from all articles published in these journals between March 1, 2021 - March 1, 2022. Participants were sent a purpose-built survey about open science. The survey contained primarily multiple choice and scale-based questions for which we report count data and percentages. For the few text-based responses we conducted thematic content analysis.

Results198 participants responded to our survey. Participants had a mean response of 6.8 (N=197, SD=1.8) on a 9-point scale with endpoints, not at all familiar (1) and extremely familiar (9), when indicating how familiar they were with open science. When asked about where they obtained open science training, most participants indicated this was done on the job self-initiated while conducting research (n=103, 52%), or that they had no formal training with respect to open science (n=72, 36%). More than half of the participants indicated they would benefit from practical support from their institution on how to perform open science practices (N=106, 54%). A diversity of barriers to each of the open science practices presented to participants were acknowledged. Participants indicated that funding was the most essential incentive to adopt open science.

DiscussionIt is clear that policy alone will not lead to the effective implementation of open science. This survey serves as a baseline for the cardiovascular research communitys open science performance and perception and can be used to inform future interventions and monitoring."

Frameworks like the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have begun to drive structural changes in engineering education, including new ABET accreditation focused on sustainability. The new field of conservation technology allows engineers to develop sustainability competencies and identities as conservationists and environmentalists.

PurposeThis manuscript describes an assessment of student identity development in conservation and environmentalism in the GaTech4Wildlife Vertically Integrated Project (VIP) course at Georgia Tech. The course uses the principles of Human-Centered Design along with the UN Sustainable Development Goals and project-based learning to solve conservation-oriented, real-world problems and develop sustainability-minded engineers.

Design/MethodUndergraduate students participated in the course and utilizing both in-person interviews and post-course assessment, students were assessed for course themes and identities. The sample consisted of students from the College of Engineering and the College of Computing.

ResultsSince 2019, over 50 students have participated in this Tech4Wildlife course. Based on surveys and interviews of nearly 20 of the most recent students, students transitioned from identifying as engineers and coders with no sustainability knowledge to nearly doubling their identity measures as conservationists and environmentalists after only one semester.

ConclusionsTo teach the next generation of sustainability-minded engineers, interdisciplinary, project-based courses grounded in Sustainable Development Goals may offer a meaningful pathway for students to develop both technical skills and conservationist identities."

P.",Juan Pablo Alperin,2023-07-10,scientific communication and education,"It has been argued that preprint coverage during the COVID-19 pandemic constituted a paradigm shift in journalism norms and practices. This study examines whether, in what ways, and to what extent this is the case using a sample of 11,538 preprints posted on four preprint servers--bioRxiv, medRxiv, arXiv, and SSRN--that received coverage in 94 English-language media outlets between 2014-2021. We compared mentions of these preprints with mentions of a comparison sample of 397,446 peer reviewed research articles indexed in the Web of Science to identify changes in the share of media coverage that mentioned preprints before and during the pandemic. We found that preprint media coverage increased at a slow but steady rate pre-pandemic, then spiked dramatically. This increase applied only to COVID-19-related preprints, with minimal or no change in coverage of preprints on other topics. In addition, the rise in preprint coverage was most pronounced among health and medicine-focused media outlets, which barely covered preprints before the pandemic but mentioned more COVID-19 preprints than outlets focused on any other topic. These results suggest that the growth in coverage of preprints seen during the pandemic period may imply a shift in journalistic norms, including a changing outlook on reporting preliminary, unvetted research."

Here, we present the career goals and career outcomes of 1,452 biomedical sciences PhDs who graduated from Vanderbilt University between 1997-2021. We categorized careers using an expanded three-tiered taxonomy and flags that delineate key career milestones. We also analyzed career goal changes between matriculation and defense, and the reasons why students became more- or less-interested in research-intensive faculty careers. We linked students career goal at defense to whether they did a postdoc, the duration of time between defense and the first non-training position, the career area of the first non-training position, and the career area of the job at ten years after graduation. Finally, we followed individual careers for ten years after graduation to characterize movement between different career areas over time. We found that most students changed their career goal during graduate school, declining numbers of alumni pursued postdoctoral training, many alumni entered first non-training positions in a different career area than their goal at defense, and the career area of the first non-training position was a good indicator of the job that alumni held 10 years after graduation. Our findings emphasize that students need a wide range of career development opportunities and career mentoring during graduate school to prepare them for futures in research and research-related professions."

We report the outcomes of this program over a five-year period. During that 5-year period, 123 internships took place at over 70 partner sites, representing at least 20 academic, for-profit, and non-profit career paths in the life sciences. A major goal of the program was to enhance trainees skill development and expertise in careers of interest. The benefits of the internship program for interns, host/employer, and supervisor/principal investigator were assessed using a mixed-methods approach, including surveys with closed- and open-ended responses as well as focus group interviews. Balancing stakeholder interests is key to creating a sustainable program with widespread support; hence, the level of support from internship hosts and faculty members were key metrics analyzed throughout. We hypothesized that once a successful internship program was implemented, faculty culture might shift to be more accepting of internships; indeed, the data quantifying faculty attitudes support this. Furthermore, host motivation and performance expectations of interns were compared with results achieved, and this data revealed both expected and surprising benefits to hosts. Data suggests a myriad of benefits for each stakeholder group, and themes are cataloged and discussed. Program outcomes, evaluation data, policies, resources, and best practices developed through the implementation of this program are shared to provide resources that facilitate the creation of similar internship programs at other institutions. Program development was initially spurred by National Institutes of Health pilot funding, thereafter, successfully transitioning from a grant-supported model, to an institutionally supported funding model to achieve long-term programmatic sustainability."

10.1101/2023.07.17.549436,Is biomedical research self-correcting? Modelling insights on the persistence of spurious science,"Grimes, D. R.",David Robert Grimes,2023-07-18,scientific communication and education,"The reality that volumes of published research are not reproducible has been increasingly recognised in recent years, notably in biomedical science. In many fields, spurious results are common, reducing trustworthiness of reported results. While this increases research waste, a common response is that science is ultimately self-correcting, and trustworthy science will eventually triumph. While this is likely true from a philosophy of science perspective, it does not yield information on how much effort is required to nullify suspect findings, nor factors that shape how quickly science may be correcting in the publish-or-perish environment scientists operate. There is also a paucity of information on how perverse incentives of the publishing ecosystem, which reward novel positive findings over null results, shaping the ability of published science to self-correct. Precisely what factors shape self-correction of science remain obscure, limiting our ability to mitigate harms. This modelling study illuminates these questions, introducing a simple model to capture dynamics of the publication ecosystem, exploring factors influencing research waste, trustworthiness, corrective effort, and time to correction. Results from this work indicate that research waste and corrective effort are highly dependent on field-specific false positive rates and the time delay before corrective results to spurious findings are propagated. The model also suggests conditions under which biomedical science is self-correcting, and those under which publication of correctives alone cannot stem the propagation of untrustworthy results. Finally, this work models a variety of potential mitigation strategies, including researcher and publication driven interventions.

Significance statementIn biomedical science, there is increasing recognition that many results fail to replicate, impeding both scientific advances and trust in science. While science is self-correcting over long time-scales, there has been little work done on the factors that shape time to correction, the scale of corrective efforts, and the research waste generated in these endeavours. Similarly, there has been little work done on quantifying factors that might reduce negative impacts of spurious science. This work takes a modeling approach to illuminate these questions, uncovering new strategies for mitigating the impact of untrustworthy research."

Despite the benefits, achieving faculty buy-in and support can be challenging even when faculty have strong research funding. In order to understand how to better support undergraduate research programs, we applied quantitative models to explore how the impact of research funding is mediated by faculty beliefs about undergraduate research mentoring in STEM disciplines. The results indicate that faculty characteristics and beliefs about the benefits and barriers of mentoring undergraduate students in research impact the number of students mentored even when accounting for research funding levels of the individual faculty. Practical recommendations are presented based on the models from this research project in order to provide insight into how centers or units on a campus may work with faculty to support and encourage mentoring of undergraduates in research in the biomedical sciences."

The growing tube model proposed by Takashi Okamoto was developed to reproduce heteromorph ammonoids and can generate various shells by changing three parameters: curvature, torsion, and enlarging ratio. Previous studies in theoretical morphology have employed computers to visualize mathematical models. However, computers are not accessible to everyone, and merely observing the graphics of the reproduced shells does not deepen understanding of the mathematical model. Therefore, in this study, we considered using origami, which is inexpensive and readily available, to make users understand mathematical models through hands-on folding. First, we simplified the crease pattern of seashells, originally devised by an origami artist Tomoko Fuse, to create a basic crease pattern. We then identified the crease pattern elements corresponding to the three parameters in the growing tube model and the aperture-apex position determiner. Based on them, we reproduced various shell shapes, including a heteromorph-ammonoid-like shape, with origami. Finally, we investigated the constraints between parameters in the origami-growing tube model. The origami-growing tube model is expected to help disseminate mathematical models and promote theoretical biology."

Verharen,2023-07-19,scientific communication and education,"The peer review process is a critical step in ensuring the quality of scientific research. However, its subjectivity has raised concerns. To investigate this issue, I examined over 500 publicly available peer review reports from 200 published neuroscience papers in 2022-2023. OpenAIs generative artificial intelligence ChatGPT was used to analyze language use in these reports. It demonstrated superior performance compared to traditional lexicon- and rule-based language models. As expected, most reviews for these published papers were seen as favorable by ChatGPT (89.8% of reviews), and language use was mostly polite (99.8% of reviews). However, this analysis also demonstrated high levels of variability in how each reviewer scored the same paper, indicating the presence of subjectivity in the peer review process. The results further revealed that female first authors received less polite reviews than their male peers, indicating a gender bias in reviewing. In addition, published papers with a female senior author received more favorable reviews than papers with a male senior author, for which I discuss potential causes. Together, this study highlights the potential of generative artificial intelligence in performing natural language processing of specialized scientific texts. As a proof of concept, I show that ChatGPT can identify areas of concern in scientific peer review, underscoring the importance of transparent peer review in studying equitability in scientific publishing."

G.",Robert H Tai,2023-07-19,scientific communication and education,"The increasing use of machine learning and Large Language Models (LLMs) opens up opportunities to use these artificially intelligent algorithms in novel ways. This article proposes a methodology using LLMs to support traditional deductive coding in qualitative research. We began our analysis with three different sample texts taken from existing interviews. Next, we created a codebook and inputted the sample text and codebook into an LLM. We asked the LLM to determine if the codes were present in a sample text provided and requested evidence to support the coding. The sample texts were inputted 160 times to record changes between iterations of the LLM response. Each iteration was analogous to a new coder deductively analyzing the text with the codebook information. In our results, we present the outputs for these recursive analyses, along with a comparison of the LLM coding to evaluations made by human coders using traditional coding methods. We argue that LLM analysis can aid qualitative researchers by deductively coding transcripts, providing a systematic and reliable platform for code identification, and offering a means of avoiding analysis misalignment. Implications of using LLM in research praxis are discussed, along with current limitations."

In cross-project defect prediction, we extract knowledge from the source project and apply that learned knowledge to predict labels for the target project. However, the model performance can be affected by features that are insignificant and irrelevant. Hybrid feature selection (HFS) can play a significant role in achieving high prediction accuracy by selecting significant and only relevant features. Our aim is to explore effect of significant feature selection through a hybrid approach upon cross-project (CP) defect prediction for datasets which are multi-class in nature. We leveraged the strengths of Random Forest (RF) and Recursive Feature Elimination Cross Validation (RFECV) which can constructively select few features which are significant. The design of our controlled experiment is 1 Factor 2 Treatments (1F2T). Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) proves that all versions of PROMISE repository are multi class and have duplicated rows in data, distribution gap among values, and imbalance classes. Hence after removing duplicated rows, reducing the gap present in distribution of data, and balancing classes, we selected significant feature set through Hybrid approach i.e. Random Forest (RF) and Recursive Feature Elimination Cross Validation (RFECV). We used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as a classifier to predict Cross project defects along with SoftMax as the last layer.

Our experimental result showed that there is significant impact of HFS on defect prediction accuracy for different datasets in the CP."

E.; Lhewa, P.; Rundquist, K.; Schultz, S.; Levers, L.; Smanski, M.",Michael Smanski,2023-07-29,scientific communication and education,"Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) is an invasive species that damages native aquatic ecosystems. Advances in genetic engineering have led to novel genetic biocontrol methods that have the potential to aid in the control of carp and other invasive species. Research and development of these technologies is proceeding in parallel with outreach activities which aim to inform and engage the public. Public perceptions on the ethics, economics, and policy decisions surrounding the possible application of genetic control technologies are important in decision-making processes. Here we report results from a survey of more than 1,300 adults that measures the perceptions of risks, benefits, and overall comfort with a panel of existing and proposed carp control methods. Our population sample largely agrees that carp control is an important issue that demands action. We observe trends suggesting that comfort levels with the possible future implementation of genetic biocontrol for common carp are strongly influenced by the perception of benefits compared to other methods, in particular effectiveness and environmental safety. No statistically significant correlations between comfort levels and river/lake use habits nor demographics are observed. There is a need for further research to identify how respondents from similar backgrounds come to different knowledge and attitudes on the matter."

A.",Jeffrey A Lewis,2023-07-29,scientific communication and education,"As one of the most famous fermented drinks in the world, beer is an especially relatable topic for microbiology courses. Here, we describe a short and easily adaptable module based on the antibacterial properties of hops used in brewing. By the 15th century, beer recipes included hops (the flower of the Humulus lupulus plant) as a bittering agent and antimicrobial. By the 19th century, the highly-hopped Indian Pale Ale (IPA) became popular, and a modern myth has emerged that IPAs were invented to survive long ocean voyages such as from Britain to India. With that myth in mind, we designed a hypothesis-driven microbiology lab module that tests the plausibility of this brewing myth-- namely that highly-hopped beers possess enough antibacterial activity to prevent spoilage, while lowly-hopped beers do not. The overall design of the module is to test the antimicrobial properties of hops using petri plates containing varying concentrations of hop extract. The module includes hypothesis generation and testing related to bacterial physiology and morphology (hops are not equally effective against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria), and to mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance (as beer spoilage bacteria have repeatedly evolved hop resistance). Pre and post assessment showed that students made significant gains in the learning objectives for the module, which encourages critical thinking and hypothesis testing by linking microbial physiology and antimicrobial resistance to an important and topical real-world application."

However, the lack of practices of sharing research outputs, such as data, source code and methods, affects transparency and reproducibility of studies, which are critical to the advancement of science. Many published studies are not reproducible due to insufficient documentation, code, and data being shared. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of 453 manuscripts published between 2016-2021 and found that 50.1% of them fail to share the analytical code. Even among those that did disclose their code, a vast majority failed to offer additional research outputs, such as data. Furthermore, only one in ten papers organized their code in a structured and reproducible manner. We discovered a significant association between the presence of code availability statements and increased code availability (p=2.71x10-9). Additionally, a greater proportion of studies conducting secondary analyses were inclined to share their code compared to those conducting primary analyses (p=1.15*10-07). In light of our findings, we propose raising awareness of code sharing practices and taking immediate steps to enhance code availability to improve reproducibility in biomedical research. By increasing transparency and reproducibility, we can promote scientific rigor, encourage collaboration, and accelerate scientific discoveries. We must prioritize open science practices, including sharing code, data, and other research products, to ensure that biomedical research can be replicated and built upon by others in the scientific community."

Since federal research funding is regionally concentrated and not geographically distributed, the benefits are not fully realized in some regions of the country. The Established (previously Experimental) Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) programs at several agencies, e.g. the National Science Foundation, and the Institutional Development Award (IDeA) program at the National Institutes of Health were created to increase competitiveness for funding in states with historically low levels of federal funding. The Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence (CoBRE) award program is a component of the IDeA program. The CoBRE grants support research core facilities to develop research infrastructure. These grants also support the research projects of junior investigators, under the guidance of mentoring teams of senior investigators, to develop human resources at these institutions. Few studies have assessed the effectiveness of these programs. This study examines the investment and outcomes of the CoBRE grants from 2000 through 2022. The maturation of junior investigators into independently funded principal investigators is comparable to other mentoring programs supported by NIH. The investment in research cores resulted in substantial research productivity, measured by publications. Despite the successes of individual investigators and increase research infrastructure and productivity, the geographic distribution of federal and NIH research dollars has not changed. These results will be informative in consideration of policies designed to enhance the geographic distribution of federal research dollars."

R.; Robson, A.",Alice Robson,2023-08-16,scientific communication and education,"To date, most efforts to decolonise curricula have focussed on the arts and humanities, with many believing that science subjects are objective, unbiased, and unaffected by colonial legacies. However, research is shaped by cultural and historical context, and inequities exist in funding, publishing and acknowledging scientific achievements. Our curricula reflect these inequities, perpetuating bias to future generations of scientists. We examined attitudes and understanding towards decolonising and diversifying the curriculum among students and teaching staff in the biomedical sciences at the University of Bristol, to discover whether our current teaching practice is perceived as inclusive. We used a mixed methods study including surveys of staff (N=71) and students (N=121) and focus groups. Quantitative data showed that staff and students think decolonising the curriculum is important, but this is more important to female respondents (p<0.001). Students are less aware than staff of current efforts to decolonise the curriculum, while students from minority ethnic groups feel less represented by the curriculum than white students. Thematic analysis of qualitative data revealed three themes that are important for a decolonised curriculum: rediscovery, representation and readiness. We propose that this  3Rs framework could guide future efforts to decolonise and diversify the curriculum in the biomedical sciences and beyond."

D.",Julie Dangremond Stanton,2023-08-18,scientific communication and education,"Stronger metacognitive regulation skills are linked to increased academic achievement. Metacognition has primarily been studied using retrospective methods, but these methods limit access to students in-the-moment metacognition. We investigated first-year life science students in-the-moment metacognition while they solved challenging problems, and asked 1) What metacognitive regulation skills are evident when first-year life science students solve problems on their own? and 2) What aspects of learning self-efficacy do first-year life science students reveal when they solve problems on their own? Think aloud interviews were conducted with 52 first-year life science students across three institutions and analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Our results reveal that first-year life science students use an array of monitoring and evaluating skills while solving problems, which challenges the deficit-oriented notion that students enter college with poor metacognitive skills. Additionally, a handful of students self-coached or encouraged themselves as they confronted aspects of the problems that were unfamiliar. These verbalizations suggest ways we can encourage students to couple their metacognitive regulation skills and self-efficacy to persist when faced with challenging disciplinary problems. Based on our findings, we offer recommendations for how instructors can help first-year life science students develop and strengthen their metacognition to achieve improved problem-solving performance."

In August 2022, Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD) denied a petition to amend state mountain lion management policies, but was mandated by the Texas Wildlife Commission to form a stakeholder group to assess the potential to initiate mountain lion management and policy. Herein, we synthesize survey data collected and previously published in a report by Ghasemi et al. (2022) to provide members of this mountain lion stakeholder working group, the Commission, and TPWD with succinct summaries of Texas residents knowledge and attitudes salient to the evaluation of mountain lion management in the state. We analyzed responses to represent the opinion of all Texans as well as to compare the sentiments of four key stakeholder groups: hunters vs. nonhunters; livestock owners vs. people without livestock; urban vs. rural residents; and Hispanics vs. non-Hispanics. Overall, Texans expressed a positive sentiment about mountain lions and supported management to conserve the species. Respondents exhibited very high consensus regarding the value of scientific research about mountain lions and expressed overwhelming support for mandatory reporting of any mountain lion killed for any purpose by hunters, trappers, or state or federal agents. Texas residents also backed a compensation program supporting livestock producers who lose animals to mountain lions and rapid checking of set traps. Contrary to expectation, hunters and livestock owners were more positive about mountain lions than non-hunters and people without livestock, and we detected no differences in the responses of urban versus rural residents or Hispanics versus non-Hispanics on any topic."

The purpose of this qualitative case study is to explore the benefits accrued by eight undergraduate and masters students who participated in authentic, small-scale research projects and disseminated their work as coauthors of peer-reviewed micropublications at a PUI. In these interviews, students reported that through the process of conducting and publishing their research, they developed specific competencies: reading scientific literature, proposing experiments, and collecting/interpreting publication-worthy data.

It is the first openly available Large Language Model (LLM) with unrestricted access to its capabilities. ChatGPT has the potential to alleviate researchers workload and enhance various aspects of research, from planning to execution and presentation. However, due to the rapid growth of publications and diverse opinions surrounding ChatGPT, a comprehensive review is necessary to understand its benefits, risks, and safe utilization in scientific research. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the topic by extensively examining existing literature on the utilization of ChatGPT in academic research. The goal is to gain insights into the potential benefits and risks of using ChatGPT in scientific research, exploring secure and efficient methods for its application while identifying potential pitfalls to minimize negative consequences.

MethodThe search was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar, yielding a total of 1279 articles and concluded on April 23rd, 2023. After full screening of titles/abstracts and removing duplicates and irrelevant articles, a total of 181 articles were included for analysis. Information collected included publication details, purposes, benefits, risks, and recommendation regarding ChatGPTs use in scientific research.

ResultsThe majority of existing literature consists of editorials expressing thoughts and concerns, followed by original research articles analyzing ChatGPTs performance in scientific research. The most significant advantage of using ChatGPT in scientific writing is its ability to expedite the writing process, enabling researchers to draft their work more efficiently. It also proves beneficial in improving writing style and proofreading by offering suggestions for sentence structure, grammar, and overall clarity. Additional benefits identified include support in data analysis, the formulation of protocols for clinical trials, and the design of scientific studies. Concerns mainly revolve around the accuracy and superficiality of the generated content, leading to what is referred to as ""hallucinations."" Researchers have also expressed concerns about the tool providing citations to nonexistent sources. Other concerns discussed include authorship and plagiarism issues, accountability, copyright considerations, potential loss of diverse writing styles, privacy and security, transparency, credibility, validity, presence of bias, and the potential impact on scientific progress, such as a decrease in groundbreaking discoveries.

ConclusionChatGPT has the potential to revolutionize scientific writing as a valuable tool for researchers. However, it cannot replace human expertise and critical thinking. Researchers must exercise caution, ensuring the generated content complements their own knowledge. Ethical standards should be upheld, involving knowledgeable human researchers to avoid biases and inaccuracies. Collaboration among stakeholders and training on AI technology are essential for identifying best practices in LLMs use and maintaining scientific integrity."

Through a study on doctoral students at a research-intensive university, we pinpoint advising from faculty as a critical component of graduate student experiences and productivity. Graduate students from minority backgrounds reported lower levels of support from their advisors and research groups. However, working with an advisor from a similar demographic background substantially improved productivity and well-being of these students. Several other aspects of mentoring practices positively predicted student success and belonging, including frequent one-on-one meetings, empathetic and constructive feedback, and relationships with other peer or faculty mentors. Our study highlights the need to renovate graduate education with a focus on retention - not just recruitment - to best prepare students for success in scientific careers."

We aimed to establish a systematic, rigorous and unbiased way to identify the areas where increased investment would accelerate progress across the whole longevity field the most. To do so, we surveyed [~]400 participants across various sectors of longevity, asking them to 1) identify the major bottlenecks they are experiencing, 2) list their most needed solution, and 3) rate the potential efficacy and barriers to development of various aging intervention strategies. We built a classification system of Bottlenecks and Solutions based on grouping related answers and found the most frequently listed bottlenecks to be 1) lack of validated aging biomarkers; 2) an overall lack of funding; and 3) lack of good models for aging studies. Surprisingly, the most wanted solution was greater availability of large public datasets. Indeed, a common theme across all answers was the need for a new data-centric structure of scientific research, where large datasets are routinely gathered and made available, access walls are removed, protocols are standardized, negative and unpublished data are shared, and AI systems are released on the data for automated discovery. Finally, a lack of regulatory clarity was listed as the biggest barrier to development across all interventions, whereas cellular reprogramming, organ replacement, and genetic medicine (gene therapies and gene editing) were perceived as the intervention strategies with the highest potential for increasing healthy lifespan. We provide these data as a resource for funding agencies, philanthropists, entrepreneurs and newcomers to the field as a means to identify high impact areas to fund and work on.

We drafted items based on qualitative research and refined the items through cognitive interviews and expert sorting. We used national dataset to evaluate the internal structure of the measure and a second national dataset to examine how responses on the MURS related to theoretically-relevant constructs and student characteristics. Our factor analytic results indicate seven lower order forms of mentoring experiences: abusive supervision, accessibility, career and technical support, psychosocial support, interpersonal mismatch, sexual harassment, and unfair treatment. These forms of mentoring mapped onto two higher-order factors: supportive and destructive mentoring experiences. Although most undergraduates reported experiencing supportive mentoring, some reported experiencing absence of supportive as well as destructive experiences. Undergraduates who experienced less supportive and more destructive mentoring also experienced lower scientific integration and a dampening of their beliefs about the value of research. The MURS should be useful for investigating the effects of mentoring experienced by undergraduate researchers and for testing interventions aimed at fostering supportive experiences and reducing or preventing destructive experiences and their impacts.

M.; Verissimo, D.",Diogo Verissimo,2023-08-25,scientific communication and education,"Conservation literature addresses a broad spectrum of interdisciplinary questions and benefits most by representing a diverse range of authors, particularly those from countries where much conservation work is focused. In other disciplines, it is well known that barriers and biases exist in the academic publishing sphere, which can impact research dissemination and an authors career development. Here, we used a Discrete Choice Experiment to determine how different journal attributes impact authors choices of where to publish in conservation. We identified three demographic groups across 1038 respondents who have previously published in conservation journals, each exhibiting different publishing preferences. Only two attributes showed a consistent response across groups: cost to publish negatively impacted journal choice, including for those in high-income countries, and authors had a consistent preference for double-blind review. Authors from middle-income countries were willing to pay more for society-owned journals, unlike authors from higher-income countries. Journals with a broad geographical scope, which were Open Access, and which had higher impact factors were preferable to two of the three demographic groups. However, we found journal scope and Open Access were more important in dictating journal choice than impact factor. Overall, our findings demonstrate that different demographics experience different preferences or limitations depending on attributes such as a journals Open Access policy. However, the scarcity of published authors from low-income countries highlights further, pervasive barriers to representation in conservation research. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations to conservation-related journals to reduce barriers to publishing and ultimately benefit conservation science."

R.; Lariviere, V.",Vincent Lariviere,2023-08-25,scientific communication and education,"Women are particularly underrepresented as leading authors of papers in journals of the highest impact factor, with substantial consequences for their careers. While a large body of research has focused on the outcome and the process of peer review, fewer articles have explicitly focused on gendered submission behavior and the explanations for these differences. In our study of nearly five thousand active authors, we find that women are less likely to report having submitted papers to journals of the highest impact (e.g., Science, Nature, or PNAS) andto submit fewer manuscripts, on average, than men when they do submit. Women were more likely to indicate that they did not submit their papers (in general and their subsequently most cited papers) to high-impact journals because they were advised not to. In the aggregate, no statistically significant difference was observed between men and women in how they rated the quality of their work. Nevertheless, regardless of discipline, women were more likely than men to indicate that their ""work was not ground-breaking or sufficiently novel"" as a rationale for not submitting to one of the listed prestigious journals. Men were more likely than women to indicate that the ""work would fit better in a more specialized journal."" We discuss the implications of these findings and interventions that can serve to mitigate the disparities caused by gendered differences in submission behavior.

SignificancePublishing in high-impact scholarly journals has a significant effect on researchers careers. Our findings identify factors that affect submission to Science, Nature, and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS) and explore whether there is a relationship between gender and desk rejections or submission rates. We found no relationship between gender and reported desk rejection and a relationship between gender and reported submissions, with men having a greater number of submissions. Women were more likely than men to indicate that their ""work was not ground-breaking or sufficiently novel"" for the listed prestigious journals and that they were advised against submitting to these venues.

In this paper, we present a mixed methods case study of one institutions efforts to improve mentorship of PEER doctoral students as a strategy to improve graduate trainees experiences, and as a strategy to positively affect institutional climate with respect to racial and ethnic diversity. We found evidence that our culturally responsive mentorship education increased faculty mentors self-reported mentorship competencies, though their valuing of culturally responsive mentoring behaviors were comparatively higher than their confidence to enact those behaviors. PEER doctoral students reported that they noticed mentors efforts to address cultural diversity matters and identified some guidance for how to approach such topics.

We find a rapid shift in attention to inclusive teaching occurs between 2018 and 2019, marked by an increase in section length, increased use of inclusive teaching keywords, and an increase in complexity of ideas in the semantic network. This critical transition occurs before many of the recent events in 2020 which have renewed conversation on equity in education. Some effect is associated with Writing Workshop Faculty Mentoring Networks, which provide participants with authoring resources and support.

C.; Artino, A. R.; Konopasky, A.",Lauren A Maggio,2023-09-04,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundBlack women in academic medicine experience racial and gender discrimination, all while being tasked with improving a flawed system. Representation of Black women in medicine remains low, yet they bear the burden of fostering diversity and mentoring trainees, exacerbating their minority tax and emotional labor, and negatively impacting career progression.

ObjectiveTo complement qualitative accounts of Black women authors in the medical education literature with a quantitative account of their representation.

DesignAn intersectional methodology employing bibliometric analysis and testimonio reflection.

SubjectsUS-based authors of journal articles published in medical education journals between 2000 and 2020.

Main measuresAuthor race was determined using a probability-based algorithm incorporating US Census data, and author gender was ascribed using Social Security Administration records. We conducted two negative binomial generalized linear models by first and last author publications. Metadata for each article was retrieved from Web of Science and PubMed to include author names, country of institutional affiliation, and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). Results were contextualized via the ""testimonio"" account of a Black woman author.

Key ResultsOf 21,945 unique authors, Black women (and other racially minoritized groups) published far fewer first and last authors papers than white women and men. In addition, major MeSH terms used by Black women authors reveal little overlap of highly ranked medical education topics. The testimonio further narrated struggles with belonging and racial identity.

ConclusionBlack women are underrepresented in medical education publishing and feel a lack of belonging. We believe that dismantling oppressive structures in the publishing ecosystem and the field is imperative for achieving equity. Additionally, further experiential accounts are needed to contextualize this quantitative account and understand oppression in medical education publishing."

We analyzed SJRs and IFs of the journals belonging to the SJR first quartile from 2013 to 2020 in 7 disciplines: mathematics, biology, physics, medicine, social sciences, chemistry, and engineering. We show that biology is the most central discipline, followed by physics and chemistry. These three disciplines also present the highest IFs. Mathematics journals display a low IF (the second-lowest among disciplines), but possesses an intermediate centrality. While the average IF has increased over the last years, the SJR average has decreased. Gini coefficients show that SJR is a slightly more egalitarian metric than IF. We discuss some possible origins of these findings."

Few estimates of the frequency of this problem have been published. This study aimed to quantify the rate of image duplication in the journal Toxicology Reports. In total 1540 unique articles (identified by DOI) were checked for the presence of research related images (microscopy, photography, western blot scans, etc). Each research paper containing at least one such image was scrutinized for the presence of inappropriate duplications, first by manual review only, and subsequently with the assistance of an AI tool (ImageTwin.ai). Overall, Toxicology Reports published 715 papers containing relevant images, and 115 of these papers contained inappropriate duplications (16%). Screening papers with the use of ImageTwin.ai increased the number of inappropriate duplications detected, with 41 of the 115 being missed during the manual screen and subsequently detected with the aid of the software. In summary, the rate of inappropriate image duplication in this journal has been quantified at 16%, most of these errors could have been detected at peer review by careful reading of the paper and related literature. The use of ImageTwin.ai was able to increase the number of detected problematic duplications."

G.; Dakin, R.",Roslyn Dakin,2023-09-06,scientific communication and education,"Scientific conclusions are based on the ways that researchers interpret data, a process that is shaped by psychological and cultural factors. When researchers use shortcuts known as heuristics to interpret data, it can sometimes lead to errors. To test the use of heuristics, we surveyed 623 researchers in biology and asked them to interpret scatterplots that showed ambiguous relationships, altering only the labels on the graphs. Our manipulations tested the use of two heuristics based on major statistical frameworks: (1) the strong prior heuristic, where a relationship is viewed as stronger if it is expected a priori, following Bayesian statistics, and (2) the p-value heuristic, where a relationship is viewed as stronger if it is associated with a small p-value, following null hypothesis statistical testing. Our results show that both the strong prior and p-value heuristics are common. Surprisingly, the strong prior heuristic was more prevalent among inexperienced researchers, whereas its effect was diminished among the most experienced biologists in our survey. By contrast, we find that p-values cause researchers at all levels to report that an ambiguous graph shows a strong result. Together, these results suggest that experience in the sciences may diminish a researchers Bayesian intuitions, while reinforcing the use of p-values as a shortcut for effect size. Reform to data science training in STEM could help reduce researchers reliance on error-prone heuristics.

Significance StatementScientific researchers must interpret data and statistical tests to draw conclusions. When researchers use shortcuts known as heuristics, it can sometimes lead to errors. To test how this occurs, we asked biologists to interpret graphs that showed an ambiguous relationship between two variables, and report whether the relationship was strong, weak, or absent. We altered features of the graph to test whether prior expectations or a statistic called the p-value could influence their interpretations. Our results indicate that both prior expectations and p-values can increase the probability that researchers will report that ambiguous data shows a strong result. These findings suggest that current training and research practices promote the use of error-prone shortcuts in decision-making."

I.",Bruce Ian Hutchins,2023-09-08,scientific communication and education,"During career advancement and funding allocation decisions in biomedicine, reviewers have traditionally depended on journal-level measures of scientific influence like the impact factor. Prestigious journals reject large quantities of papers, many of which may be meritorious. It is possible that this process could create a system whereby some influential articles are prospectively identified and recognized by journal brands but most influential articles are overlooked. Here, we measure the degree to which journal prestige hierarchies capture or overlook influential science. We quantify the fraction of scientists articles that would receive recognition because (a) they are published in journals above a chosen impact factor threshold, or (b) they are at least as well-cited as articles appearing in such journals. We find that the number of papers cited at least as well as those appearing in high-impact factor journals vastly exceeds the number of papers published in such venues. At the investigator level, this phenomenon extends across gender, racial, and career stage groupings of scientists. We also find that approximately half of researchers never publish in a venue with an impact factor above 15, which under journal-level evaluation regimes may exclude them from consideration for opportunities. Many of these researchers publish equally influential work, however, raising the possibility that the traditionally chosen journal-level measures that are routinely considered under decision-making norms, policy, or law, may recognize as little as 10-20% of this influential work."

E.",Christina A. Del Carpio,2023-09-11,scientific communication and education,"Universities benefit from recruiting and retaining diverse students, as it leads to more creative and rigorous problem solving. Efforts to improve the diversity, equity, and inclusion of graduate education have historically been focused on recruitment but are now shifting to retaining enrolled students. A low percentage of doctoral students, particularly those from historically underrepresented groups (URGs), complete their PhD within 10 years. To increase support of incoming doctoral students from URGs, UCLA established the Competitive Edge (CE) bridge program. CE provides six weeks of professional development and research training at the start of the PhD program. We surveyed 55+ first-year doctoral students (14 CE students, eight non-CE students from URGs, and 34 well-represented (WR) students) in STEM fields to understand CEs effectiveness. We found that the CE program aided students in four areas that influence graduate student attrition: mentor/mentee relationship, socialization, finances, and preparedness. At the end of their first academic year, CE students reported that the program helped them in multiple areas relating to student success, such as mental wellbeing and sense of belonging. CE students reported a larger mean growth in seven of eight skills needed in graduate school compared to NonCE URG and WR students. Short answer responses revealed that NonCE students wished for more support in areas covered by the CE program, such as managing advising relationships and protecting mental health. Additionally, CE students received significant funding during the program. The CE programs successful model at UCLA can be adapted to improve support for underrepresented doctoral students at other institutions."

T.",Scott Takeo Aoki,2023-09-15,scientific communication and education,"Engaging in research experiences as a high school or undergraduate student interested in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is pivotal for their academic and professional development. A structured teaching framework can help cultivate a students curiosity and passion for learning and research. In this study, an effective eight-week training program has been created that encompasses fundamental molecular biology principles and hands-on laboratory activities. This curriculum focuses on using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) gene editing in the Caenorhabditis elegans model organism. Through pre- and post-program assessments, substantial enhancements in students molecular biology proficiency and enthusiasm for scientific exploration was observed. Overall, this diligently crafted training module that employs C. elegans as an educational tool to instruct inexperienced students has demonstrated its accessibility and ability to engage students in molecular biology and gene editing methodologies."

M.",Andrea M Henle,2023-09-17,scientific communication and education,"This study outlines a two-week laboratory module for an authentic cell biology undergraduate research experience that uses zebrafish (Danio rerio), a popular model organism for research. Previous research has indicated that course-based undergraduate research experiences such as this one increase student confidence, active learning, and retention. During this research experience, students investigate variations in pigmentation in the caudal fins of wild type and transgenic fish (Tg(mitfa:GNAQQ209L)). The transgenic fish express a hyperactive G protein, GNAQQ209L, under the melanocyte-specific mitfa promoter, offering insights into uveal melanoma, a common eye cancer. Students specifically analyze the black pigmented cells, melanophores, within the caudal fin. We determined that the transgenic zebrafish have increased pigmentation in their caudal fins but smaller melanophores. These results suggest there are more melanophores in the Tg(mitfa:GNAQQ209L) fish compared to the wild type. Future undergraduate research could investigate these cellular differences. This research experience imparts microscopy and image analysis skills and instills the ability to grapple with large datasets, statistical tests, and data interpretation in alignment with biology education principles. Post-lab surveys reveal students attain confidence in the above skills and in handling animals, along with a deeper appreciation for model organism research and its relevance to cancer cell biology."

M.; Rabaiotti, D.; Shiffman, D.; Steen, D. A.; Wild, A. L.",Trevor Branch,2023-09-18,scientific communication and education,"Multiple studies across a variety of scientific disciplines have shown that the number of times that a paper is shared on Twitter (now called X) is correlated with the number of citations that paper receives. However, these studies were not designed to answer whether tweeting about scientific papers causes an increase in citations, or whether they were simply highlighting that some papers have higher relevance, importance or quality and are therefore both tweeted about more and cited more. The authors of this study are leading science communicators on Twitter from several life science disciplines, with substantially higher follower counts than the average scientist, making us uniquely placed to address this question. We conducted a three-year-long controlled experiment, randomly selecting five articles published in the same month and journal, and randomly tweeting one while retaining the others as controls. This process was repeated for 10 articles from each of 11 journals, recording Altmetric scores, number of tweets, and citation counts before and after tweeting. Randomization tests revealed that tweeted articles were downloaded 2.6-3.9 times more often than controls immediately after tweeting, and retained significantly higher Altmetric scores (+81%) and number of tweets (+105%) three years after tweeting. However, while some tweeted papers were cited more than their respective control papers published in the same journal and month, the overall increase in citation counts after three years (+7% for Web of Science and +12% for Google Scholar) was not statistically significant (p > 0.15). Therefore while discussing science on social media has many professional and societal benefits (and has been a lot of fun), increasing the citation rate of a scientists papers is likely not among them."

B.",Rosario A Marroquín-Flores,2023-09-21,scientific communication and education,The ability to use data and evidence as the basis for scientific reasoning is a critical skill that undergraduate students must learn to successfully transition into science careers. There is a need for pedagogical tools that promote the development of science process skills and reduce barriers to implementation in the classroom. PubNavigator (www.pubnavigator.com) is a science communication platform that shares the findings of primary literature using accessible language and features biographical information about the authors. This research assesses the utility of PubNavigator as an undergraduate teaching resource. We analyzed responses to an assignment prompting discussion of PubNavigator articles in an asynchronous online discussion forum in an introductory biology course. We conducted thematic analysis guided by the evidence-based reasoning framework to identify evidence of science reasoning and interactive enagement. We found evidence that the PubNavigator assignment elicited engagement in scientific reasoning. Students who demonstrated higher levels of engagement with the assignment also demonstrated higher levels of science reasoning in their discussion of the articles. Our findings support PubNavigator as an undergraduate teaching tool that can be used to promote science reasoning and engagement in introductory biology. We provide recommendations for implementation to instructors interested in integrating PubNavigator activities into their courses.

D.; Ebrahimzadeh, S.; Page, M.; Thibault, R.; Nguyen, P.-Y.; Abu-Dalfa, F.; Moher, D.",Kelly D Cobey,2023-09-21,scientific communication and education,"We conducted an international cross-sectional survey of biomedical researchers perspectives on the reproducibility of research. This study builds on a widely cited 2016 survey on reproducibility, and provides a biomedical-specific and contemporary perspective on reproducibility. To sample the community, we randomly selected 400 journals indexed in MEDLINE, from which we extracted the author names and e-mails from all articles published between October 1, 2020 and October 1, 2021. We invited participants to complete an anonymous online survey which collected basic demographic information, perceptions about a reproducibility crisis, perceived causes of irreproducibility of research results, experience conducting replication studies, and knowledge of funding and training for research on reproducibility. A total of 1924 participants accessed our survey, of which 1630 provided useable responses (response rate 7% of 23,234). Key findings include that 72% of participants agreed there was a reproducibility crisis in biomedicine, with 27% of participants indicating the crisis was  significant. The leading perceived cause of irreproducibility was a  pressure to publish with 62% of participants indicating it  always or  very often contributes. About half of the participants (54%) had run a replication of their own previously published study while slightly more (57%) had run a replication of another researchers study. Just 16% of participants indicated their institution had established procedures to enhance the reproducibility of biomedical research; and 67% felt their institution valued new research over replication studies. Participants also reported few opportunities to obtain funding to attempt to reproduce a study and 83% perceived it would be harder to do so than to get funding to do a novel study. Our results may be used to guide training and interventions to improve research reproducibility and to monitor rates of reproducibility over time. The findings are also relevant to policy makers and academic leadership looking to create incentives and research cultures that support reproducibility and value research quality."
10.1101/2023.09.25.559345,Undergraduates' reactions to errors mediates the association between growth mindset and study strategies,"Chouvalova, A.; Navlekar, A. S.; Mills, D. J.; Adams, M.; Daye, S.; De Anda, F.; Limeri, L. B.",Lisa B Limeri,2023-09-26,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundStudents employ a variety of study strategies to learn and master content in their courses. Strategies vary widely in their effectiveness for promoting deep, long-term learning, yet most students use ineffective strategies frequently. Efforts to educate students about effective study strategies have revealed that knowledge about effective strategies is by itself insufficient for encouraging widespread and lasting changes. An important next step is to uncover factors that influence the decisions students make about study strategy use. We explored the association between beliefs about intelligence (mindset, universality, and brilliance) and study strategies. The most effective study strategies are error-prone, and beliefs about intelligence carry implications for whether errors are a normal and even beneficial part of the learning process (e.g., growth mindset) or signs of insufficient intelligence (e.g., fixed mindset). Therefore, we hypothesized that beliefs about and reactions to errors would mediate a relationship between beliefs about intelligence and study strategies. We tested this hypothesis by surveying 345 undergraduates enrolled in an introductory biology class at a public, research-active university in northwestern United States.

ResultsConfirmatory factor analysis indicated that the internal structure of all measures functioned as expected in our sample. We fit a structural equation model to evaluate our hypothesized model. We found that mindset, but not universality nor brilliance, predicts variance in both beliefs about errors and reactions to errors. In turn, adaptive reactions to errors (but not beliefs about errors) are associated with the use of highly effective study strategies and spacing study sessions. There was a significant indirect relationship between growth mindset and spacing of study sessions.

ConclusionsOur results provide evidence for a mechanism explaining the association between students mindset beliefs and academic outcomes: believing that intelligence is improvable is associated with more adaptive reactions to making errors, which correlates with choosing more error-prone and therefore more effective study strategies. Future interventions aimed at improving students study strategies may be more effective if they simultaneously target reacting adaptively to errors and emphasize that intelligence is improvable."

Typically, microfluidics are 3D printed using digital light projection (DLP) stereolithography (SLA), but many models in use are expensive ([&ge;]$10,000 USD), limiting widespread use. Recent liquid crystal display (LCD) technology advancements have provided inexpensive (<$500) SLA 3D printers with sufficient pixel resolution for microfluidic applications. However, there are only a few demonstrations of microfluidic fabrication, limited validation of print fidelity, and no direct comparisons between LCD and DLP printers. We compared a 40 {micro}m pixel resolution DLP printer ([~]$18,000 USD) with a 34.4 {micro}m (<$380) LCD-SLA printer. Consistent with prior work, we observed linear trends between designed and measured channel widths [&ge;] 4 pixels on both printers, so we calculated accuracy above this size threshold. Using a standard IPA wash resin and optimized parameters for each printer, the average error between designed and measured widths was 2.11 {+/-} 1.26% with the DLP printer and 15.4 {+/-} 2.57% with the 34.4 {micro}m LCD printer. The average coefficient of variation [CV] was [~]2% for both printers. Printing with optimized conditions for a low-cost water wash resin designed for LCD-SLA printers resulted in an average error of 2.53 {+/-} 0.94% with the 34.4 {micro}m LCD printer and 5.35 {+/-} 4.49% with a 22 {micro}m LCD printer. We characterized additional parameters including surface roughness, channel perpendicularity, and light intensity uniformity, and as an application of LCD-printed devices, we demonstrated consistent flow rates in capillaric circuits for self-regulated and self-powered delivery of multiple liquids. In conclusion, LCD printers are an inexpensive alternative for fabricating microfluidics, with minimal differences in fidelity and accuracy compared with a 20X more expensive DLP printer."

Here, we offer ten recommendations to amplify the discoverability of studies in scientific databases. Particularly, we argue that the strategic use and placement of key terms in the title, abstract, and keyword sections can boost indexing and appeal. By surveying 237 journals in ecology and evolutionary biology, we found that current author guidelines may unintentionally limit article discoverability. Our survey of 5842 studies revealed that authors frequently exhaust abstract word limits -- particularly those capped under 250 words. This suggests that current guidelines may be overly restrictive and not optimised to increase the dissemination and discoverability of digital publications. Additionally, 91.9% of studies used redundant keywords in the title or abstract, undermining optimal indexing in databases. We encourage adopting structured abstracts to maximise the incorporation of key terms in titles, abstracts, and keywords. In addition, we encourage the relaxation of abstract and keyword limitations in journals with strict guidelines, and the inclusion of multilingual abstracts to broaden global accessibility. These evidence-based recommendations to editors are designed to improve article engagement and facilitate evidence synthesis, thereby aligning scientific publishing with the modern needs of academic research."

Yet, data that is generated by students during a course is often lost as there is no centrally organized collection and storage of the data. The loss of data prevents its re-use. To provide access to these data, I present an approach that I call studentsourcing. It collects, aggregates and reuses data that is generated by students in a practical course on cell biology. The course runs annually, and I have recorded the data that was generated by >100 students over 3 years. Two use cases illustrate how the data can be aggregated and re-used either for the scientific record or for teaching. As the data is obtained by different students, in different groups, over different years, it is an excellent opportunity to discuss experimental design and modern data visualization methods such as the superplot. The first use case demonstrates how the data can be presented as an online, interactive dashboard, providing real-time data of the measurements. The second use case shows how central data storage provides a unique opportunity to get precise quantitative data due to the large sample size. Both use cases illustrate how data can be effectively aggregated and re-used.

Larremore,2023-10-17,scientific communication and education,"Despite long-running efforts to increase gender diversity among tenured and tenure track faculty in the U.S., women remain underrepresented in most academic fields, sometimes dramatically so. Here we quantify the relative importance of faculty hiring and faculty attrition for both past and future faculty gender diversity using comprehensive data on the training and employment of 268,769 tenured and tenure-track faculty rostered at 12,112 U.S. PhD-granting departments, spanning 111 academic fields between 2011-2020. Over this time, we find that hiring had a far greater impact on womens representation among faculty than attrition in the majority (90.1%) of academic fields, even as academia loses a higher share of women faculty relative to men at every career stage. Finally, we model the impact of five specific policy interventions on womens representation, and project that eliminating attrition differences between women and men only leads to a marginal increase in womens overall representation--in most fields, successful interventions will need to make substantial and sustained changes to hiring in order to reach gender parity."

Not only are they under-represented, but they are also under-highlighted, under-mentored and overlooked for awards, grants and other career-advancing steps. To effectively address this problem and devise a solution for the inequity, we need data on the proportion of women faculty across multiple STEM institutions. Such a database, currently, does not exist. To fill this gap, we formed BiasWatchIndia to (1) document the inequities, and (2) provide real-time actionable data as a basis for future remedial steps. Along with collecting data on women representation at the faculty level in Indian STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) academia, BiasWatchIndia also helps highlight the lack of women representation and gender imbalance in Indian STEM talks, conferences, workshops and panels. Based on our findings, we recommend several measures that need to be implemented by universities and institutes to challenge the status quo changes for women in Indian academia."

To support increased student success and meet current and projected needs for qualified STEM professionals, it will be crucial to redesign majors biology by using explicit learning objectives (LOs) that can be aligned with assessments and active learning exercises. When a course is designed in this way, students have opportunities for the practice and support they need to learn, and instructors can collect the evidence they need to evaluate whether students have mastered key concepts and skills. Following an iterative process of review, revision, and evaluation, which included input from over 800 biology instructors around the country, we produced a nationally endorsed set of lesson-level LOs for a year-long introductory biology for majors course. These LOs are granular enough to support individual class sessions and provide instructors with a framework for course design that is directly connected to the broad themes in Vision and Change and the general statements in the BioCore and BioSkills Guides. Instructors can implement backward course design by aligning these community endorsed LOs with daily and weekly learning activities and with formative and summative assessments."

MethodsIn 2021, 57 third-year pharmacy students from China Pharmaceutical University were randomly divided into a PBL group and a lecture-based learning (LBL) group. Mean scores were compared between the two groups for problem-solving, self-directed learning, communication skills, critical thinking, and final exam grades. Students feedback on the implementation of PBL was also collected. A meta-analysis was subsequently performed on eight studies involving 1,819 students.

ResultsThe PBL group had significantly higher mean scores for problem-solving (8.43{+/-}1.56) and self-directed learning (7.39{+/-}1.19) than the LBL group (7.02{+/-}1.72 and 6.41{+/-}1.28, respectively). The PBL group also showed better communication skills (8.86{+/-}1.47) than the LBL group (7.68{+/-}1.89). The mean level of critical thinking was significantly higher in the PBL group than the LBL group (p=0.02). The PBL group also had better final exam grades (79.86{+/-}1.38) compared to the LBL group (68.1{+/-}1.76). Student feedback on PBL implementation was positive. The subsequent meta-analysis confirmed these findings.

Therefore, this study aims to clarify and compare the preferences for various GM foods among Japanese people in their 20s, 30s, and 40s, using the Willingness-to-pay (WTP) indicator. An online survey with 1122 valid responses from people in their 20s-40s was used for analysis. The results showed that the percentages of willingness to purchase various items were as follows - GM blue roses (n = 628; 56%), tomatoes fertilized with GM oil cake (n = 519; 46.3%), potato chips made from GM potatoes (n = 489; 43.6%), chicken thighs fed on GM corn (n = 472; 42.1%), corn flakes made from GM corn (n = 471; 42.0%), GM apples (n = 420; 37.4%), wine brewed with GM yeast (n = 416; 37.1%), GM tomatoes (n = 408; 36.4%), GM chicken thighs (n = 360; 32.1%), GM salmon (n = 349; 31.1%). Comparing the WTP discount rates for animal and plant foods, it was around 20% for animal products (GM chicken thighs = 17.8% and GM salmon = 19.5%), and 15-35% for plant foods (GM corn flakes = 24.1%, GM tomatoes = 17.2%, GM potato chips = 16.4%, GM yeast wine = 36.7%, GM apples = 25.3%). The WTP discount rates were 11.9% for tomatoes fertilized with GM oil cake compared with 17.2% for GM tomatoes, and 21.5% for GM-fed animal products compared with 17.8% for chicken thighs fed with GM corn. Therefore, the WTP values of GM animal foods were lower than GM plant foods and ornamental products."

S.",Louis S Le Clercq IV,2023-11-09,scientific communication and education,"Systematic reviews are critical summaries of the exiting literature on a given subject and, when combined with meta-analysis, provides a quantitative synthesis of evidence to direct and inform future research. Such reviews must, however, account for complex sources of between study heterogeneity and possible sources of bias, such as publication bias. This paper presents the methods and results of a research study using a newly developed software tool called ABCal (version 1.0.2) to compute and assess author bias in the literature, providing a quantitative measure for the possible effect of overrepresented authors introducing bias to the overall interpretation of the literature. ABCal includes a new metric referred to as author bias, which is a measure of potential biases per paper when the frequency or proportions of contributions from specific authors are considered. The metric is able to account for a significant portion of the observed heterogeneity between studies included in meta-analyses. A meta-regression between observed effect measures and author bias values revealed that higher levels of author bias were associated with higher effect measures while lower author bias was evident for studies with lower effect measures. Furthermore, the softwares capabilities to analyse authorship contributions and produce scientometric plots was able to reveal distinct patterns in both the temporal and geographic distributions of publications, which may relate to any evident publication bias. Thus, ABCal can aid researchers in gaining a deeper understanding of the research landscape and assist in identifying both key contributors and holistic research trends."

I.",B Ian Hutchins,2023-11-11,scientific communication and education,"Funding agencies use a variety of mechanisms to fund research. The National Institutes of Health in the United States, for example, employs scientists to perform research at its own laboratories (intramural research), and it also awards grants to pay for research at external institutions such as universities (extramural research). Here, using data from 1594 intramural grants and 97054 extramural grants funded between 2009 and 2019, we compare the scholarly outputs from these two funding mechanisms in terms of number of publications, relative citation ratio and clinical metrics. We find that extramural awards more cost-effectively fund outputs commonly used for academic review such as number of publications and citations per dollar, while intramural awards are more cost-effective at generating work that influences future clinical work, more closely in line with agency health goals. These findings provide evidence that institutional incentives associated with different funding mechanisms drive their comparative strengths."

In 2020, the ORFG formed the Equity & Open Science Working Group, leading to the launch of the Open & Equitable Model Funding Program in 2021. This program aimed to refine grantmaking processes for broader inclusivity and equitable open scholarship practices.

The program gathered a cohort of 11 funding organizations and focused on applying various proposed interventions within existing funding programs to improve grantmaking practices. The initiative highlighted the importance of targeted intervention selection and the need for delimited goal-setting, revealing challenges in implementation due to limited resources and the complexity of the processes involved.

Participants valued the pilot for its structured approach and opportunities for shared learning despite some facing complexities in fully implementing the interventions. The ORFGs future approach involves flexible intervention selection, effective resource management, and fostering a collaborative community, aiming for a more inclusive and practical application of open scholarship principles."

Our study aims to fill this gap analysing the Covid-19 emotional impact and confinement potential disruptions on researchers activity (specifically, those related to working conditions, caring responsibilities, health, balance, and social support) considering the modulating role played by age, gender, and job position. An online survey was distributed during the first lockdown period of the Covid-19 pandemic, and answers from 1301 researchers (ECR %, senior researchers %) working in Sciences (28.1%), Social Sciences (25.9%), Humanities (16.2%), Health (16.2%) and in Engineering and Architecture (13.5%) were collected. The study highlights that the initial lockdown during the Covid-19 pandemic had a significant emotional impact on researchers, exacerbating pre-existing emotional distress and burnout within this group. Factors such as age, health, gender, and difficulties in balancing work and family life were associated with an increased risk of burnout and emotional distress. Lack of social support was identified as a significant risk factor, while the academic culture prioritizing productivity over well-being contributed to the issue. These findings underscore the need for greater support and cultural changes in academia to preserve researchers mental health and prevent the chronicization of mental health issues in young academics."

A.; Baas, J.",John Ioannidis,2023-11-24,scientific communication and education,"Extreme publishing behavior may reflect a combination of some authors with genuinely high publication output and of other people who have their names listed too frequently in publications because of consortium agreements, gift authorship or other spurious practices. We aimed to evaluate the evolution of extreme publishing behavior across countries and scientific fields during 2000-2022. Extreme publishing behavior was defined as having >60 full articles (original articles, reviews, conference papers) in a single calendar year and indexed in Scopus. We identified 3,191 authors with extreme publishing behavior across science excluding Physics and 12,624 such authors in Physics. While Physics had much higher numbers of extreme publishing authors in the past, in 2022 extreme publishing authors was almost as numerous in non-Physics and Physics disciplines (1,226 vs. 1,480). Excluding Physics, China had the largest number of extreme publishing authors, followed by the USA. The largest fold-wise increases between 2016 and 2022 (5-19-fold) occurred in Thailand, Saudi Arabia, Spain, India, Italy, Russia, Pakistan, and South Korea. Excluding Physics, most extreme publishing authors were in Clinical Medicine, but from 2016 to 2022 the largest relative increases (>6-fold) were seen in Agriculture, Fisheries & Forestry, Biology, and Mathematics and Statistics. Extreme publishing authors accounted for 4,360 of the 10,000 most-cited authors (based on raw citation count) across science. While most Physics authors with extreme publishing behavior had modest citation impact in a composite citation indicator that adjusts for co-authorship and author positions, 67% of authors with extreme publishing behavior in non-Physics fields remained within the top-2% according to that indicator among all authors with >=5 full articles. Extreme publishing behavior has become worryingly common across scientific fields with rapidly increasing rates in some countries and settings and may herald a rapid depreciation of authorship standards."

P.; Dowdle, L.; Ugurbil, K.; Johnson, C.; Akcakaya, M.",Steen Moeller,2023-11-27,scientific communication and education,"PurposeTo develop an extension to locally low rank (LLR) denoising techniques based on transform domain processing that reduces the number of images required in the MR image series for high-quality denoising.

Theory and MethodsLLR methods with random matrix theory-based thresholds are successfully used in the denoising of MR image series in a number of applications. The performance of these methods depend on how well the LLR assumption is satisfied, which deteriorates with few numbers of images, as is commonly encountered in quantitative MRI applications. We propose a transform-domain approach for denoising of MR image series to represent the underlying signal with higher fidelity when using a locally low rank approximation. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated for fully-sampled k-space, undersampled k-space, DICOM images, and complex-valued SENSE-1 images in quantitative MRI applications with as few as 4 images.

ResultsFor both MSK and brain applications, the transform domain denoising preserves local subtle variability, whereas the quantitative maps based on image domain LLR methods tend to be locally more homogeneous.

ConclusionA transform domain extension to LLR denoising produces high quality images and is compatible with both raw k-space data and vendor reconstructed data. This allows for improved imaging and more accurate quantitative analyses and parameters obtained therefrom."

To fill the identified gap in science policy and advocacy training, during the pandemic years, we piloted and offered the online Science Policy & Advocacy for STEM Scientists Certificate Program starting in 2020. Over three cohorts, the program was focused on practical skills and concepts, networking, and career development opportunities, and providing pathways for PhD students and postdoctoral researchers to learn about and in many cases fully transition into science policy and advocacy roles and careers. Program participants were exposed to many important aspects of what it means to be involved in science policy and advocacy, and many chose to enter the field through subsequent opportunities facilitated by the program training. We sought to reduce a number of barriers to program participation, and additionally provided resources for others to develop similar programs at their university. We believe this training model is innovative and can be recapitulated, and sincerely hope to see more universities create similar programs in the US and internationally in order to serve trainees interested in science policy and advocacy and facilitate their building impactful careers in the field for years to come."

T.; Greenbaum, A.",Alon Greenbaum,2023-12-01,scientific communication and education,"Light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) provides the benefit of optical sectioning coupled with rapid acquisition times for imaging of tissue-cleared specimen. This allows for high-resolution 3D imaging of large tissue volumes. Inherently to LSFM, the quality of the imaging heavily relies on the characteristics of the illumination beam, with the notion that the illumination beam only illuminates a thin section that is being imaged. Therefore, substantial efforts are dedicated to identifying slender, non-diffracting beam profiles that can yield uniform and high-contrast images. An ongoing debate concerns the employment of the most optimal illumination beam; Gaussian, Bessel, Airy patterns and/or others. Comparisons among different beam profiles is challenging as their optimization objective is often different. Given that our large imaging datasets ([~]0.5TB images per sample) is already analyzed using deep learning models, we envisioned a different approach to this problem by hypothesizing that we can tailor the illumination beam to boost the deep learning models performance. We achieve this by integrating the physical LSFM illumination model after passing through a variable phase mask into the training of a cell detection network. Here we report that the joint optimization continuously updates the phase mask, improving the image quality for better cell detection. Our methods efficacy is demonstrated through both simulations and experiments, revealing substantial enhancements in imaging quality compared to traditional Gaussian light sheet. We offer valuable insights for designing microscopy systems through a computational approach that exhibits significant potential for advancing optics design that relies on deep learning models for analysis of imaging datasets."

Understanding the accuracy of its information, the sources behind its articles and their role in the transference of knowledge to the public are becoming increasingly important questions. Meanwhile, climate change has moved to the forefront of scientific and public discourse after years of warnings from the scientific community. Therefore, to understand how it was represented on English Wikipedia, we deployed a mixed-method approach on the article for ""Effects of climate change"" (ECC), its edit history and references, as well as hundreds of associated articles dealing with climate change in different ways. Using automated tools to scrape data from Wikipedia, we saw new articles were created as climatology-related knowledge grew and permeated into other fields, reflecting a growing body of climate research and growing public interest. Our qualitative textual analysis shows how specific descriptions of climatic phenomena became less hypothetical, reflecting the real-world public debate. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had a big impact on content and structure, we found using a bibliometric analysis, and what made this possible, we also discovered through a historical analysis, was the impactful work of just a few editors. This research suggests Wikipedias articles documented the real-world events around climate change and its wider acceptance - initially a hypothesis that soon became a regretful reality. Overall, our findings highlight the unique role IPCC reports play in making scientific knowledge about climate change actionable to the public, and underscore Wikipedias ability to facilitate access to research. This work demonstrates Wikipedia can be researched using both computational and qualitative methods to better understand transference of scientific information to the public and the history of contemporary science."

Despite the increasing vocalization of scientists advocating for political action, the issue of the environmental impact of academic research has been neglected for some time. Now, field-dependent initiatives have emerged, such as the non-profit organization My Green Lab, which delivers green certifications to biology and chemistry labs, and institute-dependent programs, such as the Max Planck Sustainability Network. In France, an independent collective was founded in 2019 to address the environmental footprint of academic research following the COP 15 Paris Agreement: Labos 1Point5. Building on their resources and methodology, we have quantified the overall carbon footprint of our biophysics laboratory, considering energy consumption, purchases and travel, for the year 2021. We investigate how this footprint would decrease by 2030 following systemic changes (change in the energy mix, improvements from suppliers), and we propose scenarios based on additional voluntary initiatives to reach a final reduction of -50% compared to the 2021 baseline, following IPCC targets. We have now formed a group of more than 20 colleagues to achieve this goal, emphasizing the importance of collective action. Finally, we provide advice based on our own experience to assist others in addressing the environmental impact of academic research in their respective laboratories."

M.",Tom M M Versluys,2023-12-04,scientific communication and education,"1.Plastic traits, capable of taking multiple forms, often correlate with one another or with features of the environment when measured over time. These patterns of correlated change are sometimes assumed to reflect adaptive plasticity, such as coevolved ""integrated phenotypes"" within individuals, synchronisation between social or mating partners, or responses to environmental gradients.

2. Such plasticity is ecologically and evolutionarily important, so there is considerable interest in understanding how it varies between individuals and groups. However, ""regression to the mean"", the statistical tendency for traits to revert to the average value, may create the illusion of strong bivariate correlations in timeseries data, including substantial but meaningless variation between individuals.

3. We demonstrate this using simulated and real data, revealing how regression to the mean can create bias both within and between samples. We then show, however, that its effects can often be eliminated using autoregressive models.

4. We also offer a detailed discussion of how and why regression to the mean arises, introducing the idea that it is both a statistical and ecological phenomenon."

Maris,2023-12-05,scientific communication and education,"Cancer advocates and researchers share the same goal of driving science forward to create new therapies to cure more patients. The power of combining cancer researchers and advocates has become of increased importance due to their complementary expertise. Therefore, advocacy is a critical component of grant structures and has become embedded into the Stand Up 2 Cancer (SU2C) applications. To date, the optimal way to combine these skillsets and experiences to benefit the cancer community is currently unknown. The Saint Baldricks Foundation (SBF)-SU2C now called St. Baldricks Empowering Pediatric Immunotherapies for Childhood Cancer (EPICC) Team is comprised of a collaborative network across nine institutions in the United States and Canada. Since SU2C encourages incorporating advocacy into the team structure, we have assembled a diverse team of advocates and scientists by nominating a young investigator (YI) and advocate from each site. In order to further bridge this interaction beyond virtual monthly and yearly in person meetings, we have developed a questionnaire and conducted interviews. The questionnaire is focused on understanding each members experience at the intersection between science/advocacy, comparing to previous experiences, providing advice on incorporating advocacy into team science and discussing how we can build on our work. Through creating a YI and advocate infrastructure, we have cultivated a supportive environment for meaningful conversation that impacts the entire research team. We see this as a model for team science by combining expertise to drive innovation forward and positively impact pediatric cancer patients, and perhaps those with adult malignancies.

SignificanceQuestionnaire results show both advocates and YIs see this structure to be valuable and beneficial. YIs communicated their research to a non-scientific audience and learned advocates experience. This was their first advocacy experience for most YIs. Advocates learned more about the research being conducted to provide hope. They can also aid with fundraising, publicity and lobbying. This collaboration improves science communication, designing patient-friendly clinical trials and sharing experience across institutions."

Here we present an alternative approach for how to think about the transformation of STEM courses that focuses instead on what students should know and what they can do with that knowledge. This approach, known as three-dimensional learning (3DL), emerged from the National Academys ""A Framework for K-12 Science Education"", which describes a vision for science education that centers the role of constructing productive causal accounts for phenomena. Over the past 10 years, we have collected data from introductory biology, chemistry, and physics courses to assess the impact of such a transformation on higher education courses. Here we report on an analysis of video data of class sessions that allows us to characterize these sessions as active, 3D, neither, or both 3D and active. We find that 3D classes are likely to also involve student engagement (i.e. be active), but the reverse is not necessarily true. That is, focusing on transformations involving 3DL also tends to increase student engagement, whereas focusing solely on student engagement might result in courses where students are engaged in activities that do not involve meaningful engagement with core ideas of the discipline."

Here, using a video game engine, we demonstrate the capability of rendering massive biological macromolecules at the atomic level within their native environment. To facilitate the visualization, we also provide tools that help the interactive navigation inside the cells, as well as software that converts protein structures identified using CryoET to a scene that can be explored with the game engine.

But, do awards incentivise greater transparency, diversity, and openness in science? Our cross-disciplinary survey of 222 awards for the ""best"" journal articles across all 27 SCImago subject areas revealed that journals and learned societies administering such awards generally publish little detail on their procedures and criteria. Award descriptions are brief, rarely including contact details or information on the nominations pool. Nominations of underrepresented groups are not explicitly encouraged and concepts that align with Open Science are almost absent from the assessment criteria. Instead, such awards increasingly rely on article-level impact metrics. USA-affiliated researchers dominated the winners pool (48%), while researchers from the Global South and developing countries were uncommon (11%). Sixty-one-percent of individual winners were men. Thus, Best Paper awards miss the global calls for greater transparency and equitable access to academic recognition."

This module delivers learning materials on machine learning and decision tree concepts in an interactive format that uses appropriate cloud resources for data access and analyses.

Machine learning (ML) is an important tool in biomedical research and can lead to improvements in diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases. During the COVID pandemic ML was used for predictions at the patient and community levels. Given its ubiquity, it is important that future doctors, researchers and teachers get acquainted with ML and its contributions to research. Our goal is to make it easier for everyone to learn about machine learning. The learning module we present here is based on a small COVID dataset, videos, annotated code and the use of Google Colab or the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The benefit of these platforms is that students do not have to set up a programming environment on their computer which saves time and is also an important democratization factor. The module focuses on learning the basics of decision trees by applying them to COVID data. It introduces basic terminology used in supervised machine learning and its relevance to research. Our experience with biology students at San Francisco State University suggests that the material increases interest in ML."

Kowalski,2024-01-09,scientific communication and education,"Post-baccalaureate (post-bac) programs can be instrumental in strengthening science training and expanding STEM career opportunities for junior trainees. Many of these sponsored programs are designed to increase research exposure for underrepresented minorities, including African American, Hispanic, Native American, and first-generation college students, among others. Recruiting trainees to post-bac programs can be challenging for reasons that include a lack of awareness about available programs. To address this gap, an Open House event was created with the goal of raising awareness and generating interest among potential students for future post-bac programs. Students were recruited from partnering Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) to attend a two-day event at a Primarily Undergraduate Institution (PUI) and a Research-Intensive (R1) institution. During the visit, students toured both campuses, learned about various post-bac programs and research opportunities, and interacted with faculty, current graduate students, and a former post-bac scholar. Transportation, lodging, and meals were provided. Participants completed voluntary pre-and post-event surveys. Results indicated that attendees, the majority of whom were underrepresented minorities in STEM, left with a stronger understanding of post-bac programs and how these experiences could support their future careers in STEM and that students attendance at the event made it more likely they would apply to available post-bac programs. Mentor and MSI faculty survey responses highlighted their strong support for participating in future recruitment events. These findings demonstrate that in-person Open House events, built on collaborative partnerships across institutions, are an effective strategy for increasing awareness and encouraging participation in post-bac training programs-- particularly among underrepresented student populations."

Despite this, the literature reveals a gap in generalising these effects to specific classroom activities, partly arising from the absence of suitable instruments to measure emotions in situational educational scenarios. Our study introduces an experience sampling method to measure sixteen discrete emotional states, deriving two scales for positive and negative activating emotions. Grounded in psychological and neuroscientific theories that integrate emotion with cognition, our research explores the interplay between prior knowledge, preservice teachers anticipatory situational emotions, and subsequent learning in an experimental science education context. Analysing data from 269 preservice teachers from diverse backgrounds (STEM and non-STEM) at the upper-secondary level, we found that negative activating emotions are often rooted in non-STEM backgrounds and exacerbated by limited prior science knowledge. These negative emotions impact achievement and learning primarily through the mediating role of boredom. Furthermore, our results indicate that the detrimental impact of boredom on achievement is significantly influenced by prior knowledge, with a more pronounced effect on students with lower levels. Given that emotions are amenable to intervention, our findings propose that specifically addressing boredom in students with low prior knowledge could amplify the benefits of educational strategies."

We use stable diffusion, one of the most recent generative algorithms, to create such a set of artificial histological samples and in a large study with over 800 participants, we study the ability of human subjects to discriminate between such artificial and genuine histological images. Although they perform better than naive participants, we find that even experts fail to reliably identify fabricated data. While participant performance depends on the amount of training data used, even low quantities result in convincing images, necessitating methods to detect fabricated data and technical standards such as C2PA to secure data integrity."

E.; Simon, A. F.",Anne F Simon,2024-01-28,scientific communication and education,"Undergraduate research is a high impact practice that offers numerous benefits to students, academic institutions, and the wider scientific community. Unfortunately, undergraduate research has faced restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to assess how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted: (1) the number and types of undergraduate research projects performed in the Department of Biology at the University of Western Ontario, and (2) the satisfaction-levels and perceived learning outcomes of students performing these projects. This study also aimed to incorporate a  One Health framework through an emphasis on stakeholder involvement and the need for future action.

A survey of 33 students who completed an undergraduate research project in the Department of Biology in the 2020/2021 academic year, and 68 students who completed an undergraduate research project in the 5 years prior was conducted. In keeping with the One Health approach, key stakeholders were identified, and a stakeholder map was constructed.

The number of projects performed did not change dramatically despite COVID-19 restrictions. However, a shift towards dry research was observed with 87.9% of students in the 2020/2021 academic year conducting dry research, compared to 16.4% of students in the 5 years prior. Students who conducted research in the 2020/2021 academic year indicated lower overall levels of satisfaction and enjoyment, though their perceived learning outcomes were consistent with students who completed their projects in the 5 years prior. 53 key stakeholders from academia, government, industry, media, and the public were identified.

Students provided invaluable feedback on their undergraduate research experiences that can be used to improve the quality of undergraduate research courses in the Department of Biology in the future. Findings may be of use to other departments and educational institutions that are seeking to improve their own undergraduate research courses amidst the COVID-19 pandemic or looking to incorporate experiential-based learning techniques into existing online courses."

Virtual labs have been implemented in a number of diverse educational settings, which have many purported benefits including their adaptability, accessibility, and repeatability. However, few studies have evaluated the impact of virtual laboratories outside of academic achievement and skills competencies, especially in biotechnology. In this study, an interdisciplinary team of content experts, video game researchers, instructional designers, and assessment experts developed a 3D immersive simulation designed to teach novice scientists the technical skills necessary to perform sterile mammalian cell culture technique. Unique to the simulation development process is the recreation of an immersive experience through the capture of details in the real-world lab where participants have the freedom of choice in their actions, while receiving immediate feedback on their technical skills as well as procedural execution. However, unlike an in-person laboratory course, students are able to iterate and practice their skills outside of class time and learn from their mistakes. Using a mixed-methods study design, over the course of two semesters we evaluated student attitudes of the simulation and their science motivational beliefs including self-efficacy and science identity after engaging with the simulation prior to the physical laboratory. Our results show that students science identity remained unchanged while their science self-efficacy increased. Furthermore, students had positive perceptions of the benefits of the virtual simulation. These data suggest that the virtual cell culture simulation can be a useful pedagogical training tool to bolster students motivational beliefs that is both accessible and easy to implement."

To determine medical and science undergraduate students preference of scientist, a designed preference survey was administered to 191 medical and 106 science majors, online. The chi-square test, regression, and mediation models were used. The models present significant associations between group and training programs, and between masters program and scientist preference. Surprisingly, only 24% of the science students were interested in the PhD program compared to the 79.6% of the medical students. Less than 7% in both groups expressed interest in full-time scientist occupation. The study design and findings are newly reported. A negative public consensus of scientist occupation is identified, and master training program shows strong association with choice of scientist occupation. Due to the unstable scientists status, a long-term follow-up is recommended afterward program completion for more effectively fostering scientists."

Much of the research to-date has focused on drivers of interest in (and intention to pursue) various careers, especially during graduate school, but fewer studies have investigated the ultimate career outcomes of participants. Even less is known about what factors matter most for groups historically underrepresented in the US STEM workforce, such as for women, some racial and ethnic groups, and persons with disabilities (National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics (NCSES), 2021a). This study reports a new analysis of data from 781 PhD neuroscientists that were obtained from a retrospective survey (reported in Ullrich et al. (2021)) to investigate the factors that influence the career sector in which neuroscience PhDs are employed, and whether there were group differences according to social identity. We find evidence of academia as a ""default path"" for incoming PhD students, but interest in different careers changes gradually over time. Those who remained in academia had greater acceptance of the structural aspects of academic careers, such as the promotion and tenure process, and greater faculty support during their postdoctoral training. Conversely, prioritizing monetary compensation and wanting varied work were associated with not being in academia, while a strong interest in research was positively associated with being in non-academic research. Somewhat surprisingly, there were few interactions with gender, and no interactions with underrepresentation status. Our findings also underscore the role of advisors, networking, and personal relationships in securing employment in STEM."
10.1101/2024.02.01.578440,Structured Peer Review: Pilot results from 23 Elsevier Journals,"Malicki, M.; Mehmani, B.",Mario Malički,2024-02-04,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundReviewers rarely comment on the same aspects of a manuscript, making it difficult to properly assess manuscripts quality and the quality of the peer review process. It was the goal of this pilot study to evaluate structured peer review implementation by: 1) exploring if and how reviewers answered structured peer review questions, 2) analysing reviewer agreement, 3) comparing that agreement to agreement before implementation of structured peer review, and 4) further enhancing the piloted set of structured peer review questions.

MethodsStructured peer review consisting of 9 questions was piloted in August 2022 in 220 Elsevier journals. We randomly selected 10% of these journals across all fields and IF quartiles and included manuscripts that in the first 2 months of the pilot received 2 reviewer reports, leaving us with 107 manuscripts belonging to 23 journals. Eight questions had open ended fields, while the ninth question (on language editing) had only a yes/no option. Reviews could also leave Comments-to-Author and Comments-to-Editor. Answers were qualitatively analysed by two raters independently.

ResultsAlmost all reviewers (n=196, 92%) filled out the answers to all questions even though these questions were not mandatory in the system. The longest answer (Md 27 words, IQR 11 to 68) was for reporting methods with sufficient details for replicability or reproducibility. Reviewers had highest (partial) agreement (of 72%) for assessing the flow and structure of the manuscript, and lowest (of 53%) for assessing if interpretation of results are supported by data, and for assessing if statistical analyses were appropriate and reported in sufficient detail (also 52%). Two thirds of reviewers (n=145, 68%) filled out the Comments-to-Author section, of which 105 (49%) resembled traditional peer review reports. Such reports contained a Md of 4 (IQR 3 to 5) topics covered by the structured questions. Absolute agreement regarding final recommendations (exact match of recommendation choice) was 41%, which was higher than what those journals had in the period of 2019 to 2021 (31% agreement, P=0.0275).

ConclusionsOur preliminary results indicate that reviewers adapted to the new format of review successfully, and answered more topics than they covered in their traditional reports. Individual question analysis indicated highest disagreement regarding interpretation of results and conducting and reporting of statistical analyses. While structured peer review did lead to improvement in reviewer final recommendation agreements, this was not a randomized trial, and further studies should be done to corroborate this. Further research is also needed to determine if structured peer review leads to greater knowledge transfer or better improvement of manuscripts."

While Southern Nevada also observed similar closures for onsite programs, we and others hypothesized that in-person laboratory activities could be prioritized after increasing vaccine doses were available to the public and masking was encouraged. Here, we describe how the Laboratory of Neurogenetics and Precision Medicine at the University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV) collaborated with administrators from a local school district to conduct training activities for high school students during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Science Education for the Youth (SEFTY) programs curriculum was constructed to incorporate experiential learning, fostering collaboration and peer-to-peer knowledge exchange. Leveraging neuroscience tools from our UNLV laboratory, we engaged with 117 high school applicants from 2021-2022. Our recruitment efforts yielded a diverse cohort, with >41% Pacific Islander and Asian students, >9% African American students, and >12% multiracial students. We assessed the impact of the SEFTY program through pre- and post-assessment student evaluations, revealing a significant improvement of 20.3% in science proficiency (p<0.001) after participating in the program. Collectively, our laboratory curriculum offers valuable insights into the capacity of an outreach program to actively foster diversity and cultivate opportunities for academic excellence, even in the challenging context of a global pandemic.

Significance StatementThe Science Education for the Youth (SEFTY) program at UNLV successfully engaged 117 diverse high school students in neuroscience-based experiential learning, demonstrating the viability of in-person education during a pandemic. Significant improvements in science proficiency (20.3% increase) underscore the programs effectiveness in fostering academic excellence and diversity. This initiative potentially serves as a model for maintaining high-quality, inclusive science education in challenging times."

Printed materials facilitate deeper engagement and comprehension, leading to superior exam performance and enhanced retention. However, existing digital tools often need to pay more attention to the needs of researchers who value the tactile benefits of printed documents. In response to this gap, we introduce AR-PaperSync, a transformative solution that leverages Augmented Reality (AR) and cross-device interaction technology. AR-PaperSync seamlessly integrates the physical experience of printed papers with the interactive capabilities of digital tools. Researchers can effortlessly navigate inline citations, manage saved references, and synchronize reading notes across mobile, desktop, and printed paper formats. Our user-centric approach, informed by in-depth interviews with six researchers, ensures that AR-PaperSync is tailored to its target users needs. A comprehensive user study involving 28 participants evaluated AR-PaperSyncs significantly improved efficiency, accuracy, and cognitive load in academic reading tasks compared to conventional methods. These findings suggest that AR-PaperSync enhances the reading experience of printed scientific papers and provides a seamless integration of physical and digital reading environments for researchers."

C.; Malcom-Piqueux, L.",Douglas C Rees,2024-02-14,scientific communication and education,"Despite the importance of the postdoctoral position in the training of scientists for independent research careers, few studies have addressed recruiting and hiring of postdocs. We conducted a pilot study on postdoctoral hiring in the Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering at the California Institute of Technology to serve as a starting point to better understand postdoctoral recruiting and hiring processes. From this survey of both postdocs and faculty, together with the available literature, the picture emerges that the postdoc hiring process is more decentralized than either faculty hiring or graduate admissions. Postdoc positions are often filled through a passive process where the initial expression of interest from a prospective postdoc is through a ""cold-call"" contact to a prospective advisor. Individual faculty members are often responsible for developing and implementing their own outreach and recruitment plans and deciding who to hire into a postdoc position. The overall opacity of the processes and practices by which postdocs are identified, recruited, and hired make it difficult to pinpoint where interventions could be effective to ensure equitable hiring practices. Implementation of such practices is critical to training a diverse postdoc population and subsequently of the future STEM faculty recruited from this group."

By analyzing properly selected datasets, the students can calculate parameters and draw conclusions about genetic diversity, differentiation and evolution of populations with higher efficiency than if based exclusively on theoretical lessons. However, preparing the appropriate datasets is a hard task and a wrong selection can spoil a well-aimed practice. Here we present SO_SCPLOWIMC_SCPLOWHO_SCPLOWYBC_SCPLOW 2, a software tool specifically intended to ease the full understanding of evolutionary forces by the students and to help the teacher to prepare adequate datasets and examples for the practices. It simulates the course of a mixed population under user-defined reproductive and evolutionary conditions. Outputs can be easily adapted for downstream analysis with other popular tools as GO_SCPLOWENC_SCPLOWAO_SCPLOWLC_SCPLOWEO_SCPLOWXC_SCPLOW or SO_SCPLOWTRUCTUREC_SCPLOW. Thus, SO_SCPLOWIMC_SCPLOWHO_SCPLOWYBC_SCPLOW 2 is very suitable for project-based-learning approaches: students can produce their own datasets in different scenarios of genetic drift, migration, selective advantage, reproductive success... Additionally, SO_SCPLOWIMC_SCPLOWHO_SCPLOWYBC_SCPLOW 2 is the only simulation software available to date providing traceable pedigrees of individuals, being therefore very convenient for preparing datasets for parentage analysis, spatial genetic structure or conservation genetics study cases.

Genomics research plays a crucial role in understanding the emergence, spread and containment measures of AMR. However, its implementation in such settings is particularly challenging due to limited human capacity. This manuscript outlines a three-day bioinformatics workshop in Cameroon, highlighting efforts to build human capacity for genomics research to support AMR surveillance using readily accessible and user-friendly web-based tools. The workshop introduced participants to basic next-generation sequencing concepts, data file formats used in bacterial genomics, data sharing procedures and considerations, as well as the use of web-based bioinformatics software to analyse genomic data, including in silico prediction of AMR, phylogenetics analyses, and a quick introduction to Linux(C) command line.

We provide a detailed description of the relevant training approaches used, including workshop structure, the selection and planning, and utilization of freely available web-based tools, and the evaluation methods employed. Our approach aimed to overcome limitations such as inadequate infrastructure, limited access to computational resources, and scarcity of expertise. By leveraging the power of freely available web-based tools, we demonstrated how participants can acquire fundamental bioinformatics skills, enhance their understanding of biological data analysis, and contribute to the field, even in an underprivileged environment.

Our findings highlight the effectiveness of this training approach in empowering local researchers and bridging the bioinformatics gap in genomics surveillance of AMR in resource-constrained settings. Building human capacity for genomics research globally, and especially in resource-constrained settings, is imperative for ensuring global health and sustainable containment of AMR.

These interventions are welcome and have done much to enhance graduate bioscience training, but they may also be overwhelming for trainees. To streamline professional development and career education information for the bioscience graduate students at our institution, we tested a model where we built a centralized web portal of career development resources. Here we present our strategy and best practices for website design. We show data that students preferred a centralized online portal over other forms of resource communication; that programming, paired communication and environmental factors (e.g. remote learning and work as in the COVID-19 pandemic) combined to increase sustained engagement with the site; and that harnessing website analytics is an effective way to measure site utilization and generate insights on programming and resource development.

In this study we analyze data from over 2500 ASM publications to see how this policy affected gender bias and how research teams are making decisions on author order. Data on publications from 2018-2021 show that gender bias was largely nonsignificant both before and after authors were asked by ASM to provide an EC statement. The most likely reasons for EC order included alphabetical order, seniority, and chance, although there were differences for publications from different geographic regions.

With the first Covid-19 national lock-down in England in March 2020, on-campus education at higher education institutions was swiftly moved to alternative provisions, including online only options, a mix of synchronous or asynchronous blended, or hybrid adaptions. Students enrolled on an undergraduate bioscience programme have been faced with unprecedented changes and interruptions to their education. This study aimed to evaluate bioscience students ability to adjust to a fast-evolving learning environment and to capture students journey building up resilience and graduate attributes.

Bioscience undergraduate students in years 1-3 at the biology department at a Northwest English university participated in this anonymous, cross-sectional, mixed-method study with open and closed questions evaluating their perception and feedback to remote and blended learning provisions during the Covid-19 pandemic and post pandemic learning capturing academic years 2019/20 to 2022/23.

The Covid-19 pandemic and the consequent restriction of personal social interaction resulted in an significant decrease in the mental wellbeing of undergraduate bioscience students in this study, cumulating in poor or very poor self-rating of wellbeing in spring 2021; while at the same time students showed evidence of advanced adaption to the new learning and social environment by acquisition of additional technical, social and professional graduate-level skills, indicative of an, albeit unconscious, transition to resilience. Post pandemic, bioscience students worry about the increased living costs and are strongly in favour of a mixture of face-to-face and blended learning approaches.

Our results show that bioscience students can experience poor mental health while developing resilience, indicating tailored support can aid students resilience performance. Students have adjusted with ease to digital teaching provisions and expect higher education institutions continue to offer both, face-to-face, and blended teaching, reducing the burden on students significantly risen living costs."

A.; Wells, C.",Christine Wells,2024-03-12,scientific communication and education,"The recently issued ISSCR standards in stem cell research recommend registration of human pluripotent stem cell lines (hPSCs). Registration is an important part of establishing stem cell provenance and connecting cell lines to data derived on those lines. In this study, we sought to understand common barriers to registration, by conducting interviews with forty-eight Australian stem cell stakeholders, including researchers, clinicians, and industry professionals. Australian stem cell researchers do not routinely register their lines, and of those Australian lines captured by an international registry, only a third have completed the registration process. Most registered Australian cell lines miss information about their ethical provenance or key pluripotency characteristics. Incomplete registration is poorly aligned with the goals of open science that registries are founded on, and users themselves expressed concerns about the quality of the partial information provided to the resource. Registration was considered a publication hurdle, and this impacted on user perceptions of usefulness of registration, and lowered the likelihood that they would engage with registries to find resources. Although the Australian community represents a small fraction of registry users, the results of this study may suggest ways for journals, registries, and the stem cell community to improve registration compliance.

HighlightsResearchers who perceive registration as a publication hurdle are unlikely to complete the registration process.

Incomplete registration promotes misunderstandings about the goals and quality of a registry. Full registration of pluripotent stem cell lines is an important step in verifying cell line provenance.

Greater public awareness of registration, combined with requirements for full registration by journals will support the community adopt ISSCR recommendations to register lines."

The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine is one of [~]45 institutions with a National Institutes of Health funded Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) that provides mentoring and a year of fulltime research to prepare students from historically excluded groups for graduate school. Having experienced the conflation of stresses during the COVID-19 pandemic and related shutdown, we realized our program lacked a component that explicitly helped PREP Scholars recognize and cope with non-academic stresses (financial, familial, social, mental) that might threaten their confidence and success as scientists and future in STEMM.

InterventionWe developed an early-intervention program to help Scholars develop life-long skills to become successful and resilient scientists. We developed a year-long series comprised of 9 workshops focused on community, introspection, financial fitness, emotional intelligence, mental health, and soft-skills. We recruited and compensated a cohort of PhD students and postdoctoral fellows to serve as Peer Mentors, to provide a community and the safest  space for Scholars to discuss personal concerns. Peer Mentors were responsible for developing and facilitating these Community-Building Wellness Workshops (CBWW).

ContextCBWW were created and exectued as part of the larger PREP program. Workshops included a PowerPoint presentation by Peer Mentors that featured several case studies that prompted discussion and provided time for small-group discussions between Scholars and Peer Mentors. We also included pre- and post-work for each workshop. These touch-points helped Scholars cultivate the habit of introspection.

ImpactThe CBWW exceeded our goals. Both Peer Mentors and Scholars experienced strong mutual support, and Scholars developed life-long skills. Notably, several Scholars who had been experiencing financial, mental or mentor-related stress immediately brought this to the attention of program leadership, allowing early and successful intervention. At the completion of CBWW, PREP Scholars reported implementing many workshop skills into practice, were reshaping their criteria for choosing future mentors, and evaluating career decisions. Strikingly, Peer Mentors found they also benefitted from the program as well, suggesting a potential larger scope for the role of CBWW in academia.

However, these provide few details on the reduction targets themselves, leaving the question of how should higher education and research organizations define and construct their climate targets and trajectories unanswered. The present paper fills this gap. We first review and analyze the documents describing the climate strategies of 53 higher education and research organizations coming from 11 countries, based on their detailed GreenHouse Gas emissions (GHGs) reporting. The selected reports include at least one target re-duction for at least one target year. Then, on the basis of this analysis we propose guidelines to encourage and help higher education and research organizations set rele-vant climate targets."

S.; Fankhauser, S. C.",Sarah C Fankhauser,2024-03-18,scientific communication and education,"Peer-review and publication are important parts of the scientific enterprise, and research has shown that engaging students in such scholarly practices helps build their sense of belonging and scientific identity. Yet, these disciplinary literacy skills and professional practices are often part of the hidden curriculum of science research, thus excluding students and others from fully understanding ways in which scientific knowledge is constructed, refined, and disseminated even though students are participating in such activities. Secondary students are increasingly involved in scientific research projects that include authentic disciplinary literacy components such as research proposals, posters, videos, and scientific research papers. More and more, students are also engaging in professional practice of publishing their scientific research papers through dedicated secondary science journals. How teachers and other mentors support the development of professional disciplinary literacies in students is critical to understand as part of supporting more student participation in research. To this end, we used a mixed- methods study of interviews and surveys to examine the experience and conceptions of the mentors (teachers and professional scientists) who guided pre-college students through the writing and publication of their scientific research projects. Analyzing our data from a lens of cognitive apprenticeship, we find that mentors encourage independence by primarily employing the method of ""exploration"". We also find that mentors have divergent views on the value of publication within science, versus for student scientists specifically. Our findings suggest that mentors could work to explicitly reveal their own thinking within science writing to provide more sequenced support for student scientists."

Despite customs and veterinary checks during imports, comprehensive data on this global industry remains scarce. This study provides an updated review on one of its largest import markets, the European Union (EU): 24-million-euro annual trade value, detailed exporting and importing countries also diversity of species and families of the 26 million specimens imported between 2014 and 2021. We then show how a watchlist alert system based on the number of specimens traded, import trends, and vulnerability index according to FishBase and IUCN Red List conservation status can provide key information on which species should require a closer scrutiny. The stark decline in trade of the most traded species, Chromis viridis, may warrant monitoring through the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). While the European TRAde Control and Expert System (TRACES) electronically monitors the movement of live animals to respond quickly to biosecurity risks, one-third of marine ornamental fishes imported lack species-level information. With minor adjustments, TRACES could enhance the monitoring of wildlife trade, with marine ornamental fish being an interesting case study."

This study investigates a critical question: Have AI-generated texts from LLM infiltrated the realm of scientific writing, and if so, to what extent and in what setting? By analyzing a dataset comprised of preprint manuscripts uploaded to arXiv, bioRxiv, and medRxiv over the past two years, we confirmed and quantified the widespread influence of AI-generated texts in scientific publications using the latest LLM-text detection technique, the Binoculars LLM-detector. Further analyses with this tool reveal that: (1) the AI influence correlates with the trend of ChatGPT web searches; (2) it is widespread across many scientific domains but exhibits distinct impacts within them (highest: computer science, engineering sciences); (3) the influence varies with authors who have different language speaking backgrounds and geographic regions according to the location of their affiliations (Italy, China, etc.); (4) AI-generated texts are used in various content types in manuscripts (most significant: hypothesis formulation, conclusion summarization); (5) AI usage has a positive influence on papers impact, measured by its citation numbers.

Training healthcare specialists who are knowledgeable in both health and data sciences is highly required, important, and challenging. Therefore, it is essential to analyse students learning experiences through artificial intelligence techniques in order to provide both teachers and learners with insights about effective learning strategies and to improve existing HDS course designs.

MethodsWe applied artificial intelligence methods to uncover learning tactics and strategies employed by students in an HDS massive open online course with over 3,000 students enrolled. We also used statistical tests to explore students engagement with different resources (such as reading materials and lecture videos) and their level of engagement with various HDS topics.

ResultsWe found that students in HDS employed four learning tactics, such as actively connecting new information to their prior knowledge, taking assessments and practising programming to evaluate their understanding, collaborating with their classmates, and repeating information to memorise. Based on the employed tactics, we also found three types of learning strategies, including low engagement (Surface learners), moderate engagement (Strategic learners), and high engagement (Deep learners), which are in line with well-known educational theories. The results indicate that successful students allocate more time to practical topics, such as projects and discussions, make connections among concepts, and employ peer learning.

ConclusionsWe applied artificial intelligence techniques to provide new insights into HDS education. Based on the findings, we provide pedagogical suggestions not only for course designers but also for teachers and learners that have the potential to improve the learning experience of HDS students."

N.; Silberg, J. J.",Jonathan J Silberg,2024-04-01,scientific communication and education,"Teamwork is recognized as critical to solving complex societal challenges related to energy, health, and sustainability. With graduate education, students often gain teamwork experience through a problem-focused approach where they are brought into existing collaborations to pursue research that is focused on studying questions that have already been identified. Here, we describe an interdisciplinary educational program where graduate students were tasked with leading team formation, problem identification, and research formulation. This ""team-first"" training approach used a two-year curriculum to bring together students enrolled in diverse engineering and science graduate programs and provided students with a pedagogical understanding of interdisciplinarity, nurtured the development of student communication skills across disciplines, fostered student-led team formation and idea development, and empowered students to forge new connections between research groups. Assessment of three cohorts immediately following curriculum completion (n = 36) revealed significant gains in confidence in teamwork (p < 0.001) when compared to a control group of academic peers (n = 74). These gains varied across demographic groups, with women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics presenting the strongest gains. This finding illustrates the importance of exploring how interdisciplinary team curricula in graduate school could support overcoming the gender gap in confidence.

SignificancePedagogical models for graduate education often neglect the importance of teamwork training. Here, we describe an interdisciplinary training program that was developed to bring together doctoral students from diverse science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines for a two-year curriculum that focused on teamwork training through student-led team formation, problem identification, and research formulation. Following program participation, we measured participant confidence in teamwork relative to a peer group. Our findings reveal gains with confidence in teamwork, with women presenting the strongest increases without negative effects on other groups. This pedagogical approach represents a strategy to close gender gaps in professional role confidence while complementing the benefits of traditional disciplinary training approaches."

Developing a scholarly identity by engaging in a scientific community through writing and communication is an important component for STEM retention, particularly for underrepresented individuals. Several excellent pedagogical tools have been developed to teach scientific literacy and to measure competency in reading and interpreting scientific literature. However, fewer tools exist to measure learning gains with respect to writing, or that teach the more abstract processes of peer review and scientific publishing, which are essential for developing scholarly identity and publication currency. Here we describe our approach to teaching scientific writing and publishing to undergraduate students within a synthetic biology course. Using gold standard practices in project-based learning, we created a writing project in which students became experts in a specific application area of synthetic biology with relevance to an important global problem or challenge. To measure learning gains associated with our learning outcomes, we adapted and expanded the Student Attitudes, Abilities, and Beliefs (SAAB) concept inventory to include additional questions about the process of scientific writing, authorship, and peer review. Our results suggest the project-based approach was effective in achieving the learning objectives with respect to writing and peer reviewed publication, and resulted in high student satisfaction and student self-reported learning gains. We propose that these educational practices will contribute directly to the development of scientific identity of undergraduate students as synthetic biologists, and will be useful in creating a more diverse synthetic biology research enterprise."

R.",Tania Miguel Trabajo,2024-04-06,scientific communication and education,"1.Inspired by the positive impact of serious games on science understanding and motivated by personal interests in scienti[fi]c outreach, we developed  Bacttle, an easy-to-play microbiology board game with adaptive difficulty, targeting any player from 7 years old onward. Bacttle addresses both the lay public and teachers for use in classrooms as a way of introducing microbiology concepts.

The layout of the game and its mechanism are the result of multiple rounds of trial, feedback and re-design. The [fi]nal version consists of a deck of cards, a 3D-printed board and tokens (with a paper-based alternative), with all digital content open source. Players in Bacttle take on the character of a bacterial species. The aim for each species is to proliferate under the environmental conditions of the board and the interactions with the board and with other players, which vary as the play evolves. Players start with a given number of lives that will increase or decrease based on the traits they play for different environmental scenarios. Such bacterial traits come in the form of cards that can be deployed strategically.

In order to assess the impact of the game on microbiological knowledge, we scored differences in the understanding of general concepts before and after playing the game. We assessed a total of 169 visitors at two different university open day science fairs. Players were asked to [fi]ll a brief survey before and after the game with questions targeting conceptual advances. Results show that Bacttle increases general microbiology knowledge on players as young as 5 years old, and with the highest impact on those who have no a priori microbiology comprehension."

Preprints can also be revised and improved based on scientific commentary uncoupled from journal-organised peer review. The uptake of preprints in the life sciences has increased significantly in recent years, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, when immediate access to research findings became crucial to address the global health emergency.

With ongoing expansion of new preprint servers, improving discoverability of preprints is a necessary step to facilitate wider sharing of the science reported in preprints. To address the challenges of preprint visibility and reuse, Europe PMC, an open database of life science literature, began indexing preprint abstracts and metadata from several platforms in July 2018. Since then, Europe PMC has continued to increase coverage through addition of new servers, and expanded its preprint initiative to include the full text of preprints related to COVID-19 in July 2020 and then the full text of preprints supported by the Europe PMC funder consortium in April 2022. The preprint collection can be searched via the website and programmatically, with abstracts and the open access full text of COVID-19 and Europe PMC funder preprint subsets available for bulk download in a standard machine-readable JATS XML format. This enables automated information extraction for large-scale analyses of the preprint corpus, accelerating scientific research of the preprint literature itself.

This study investigates this phenome in depth the Brazilian context, examining who comprises this diaspora (doctorates, postdocs, lecturers), where they have migrated, and their areas of study. We conducted this examination based on publications by Brazilian doctors who graduated between 2005 and 2021, as well as post-doctorates and students with full doctorate scholarships abroad. These students were identified on the CAPES open data website. The publications of these authors were captured in Scopus and Web of Science. Then those with addresses abroad were analysed in Vosviewer(R) and using logistic regression (stayed abroad or not), area of knowledge and a decision tree to see the effect of the Brazilian university region, type of institution and scholarship on the decision to migrate. The level of diaspora is approximately 1.7% among all doctorates trained in Brazil, reaching 6.6% in postdoctoral scholars with experience abroad. This suggests that PhDs with advanced training and experience have a higher propensity to emigrate from Brazil. These PhDs predominantly choose to migrate to North America and Western Europe, with a strong preference for careers in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. Brazilian PhDs with international experience tend to have a more diverse migration pattern, while those who complete their PhD in Brazil show a distinct preference for migrating to Portugal, indicating differing global mobility based on scientific experience. A decision tree analysis reveals that life or exact sciences PhDs, those who graduated after 2012, and obtained their postgraduate degrees from institutions in the southeast or south of Brazil are more likely to migrate. While the reasons behind these migration patterns are not evaluated in this study, better job prospects, higher salaries, or more substantial research funding could be influential factors in the decision to migrate."

Hardwicke,2024-04-30,scientific communication and education,"Research articles published by the journal eLife are accompanied by short evaluation statements that use phrases from a prescribed vocabulary to evaluate research on two dimensions: importance and strength of support. Intuitively, the prescribed phrases appear to be highly synonymous (e.g., important/valuable, compelling/convincing) and the vocabularys ordinal structure may not be obvious to readers. We conducted an online repeated-measures experiment to gauge whether the phrases were interpreted as intended. We also tested an alternative vocabulary with (in our view) a less ambiguous structure. 301 participants with a doctoral or graduate degree used a 0-100% scale to rate the importance and strength of support of hypothetical studies described using phrases from both vocabularies. For the eLife vocabulary, most participants implied ranking did not match the intended ranking on both the importance (n = 59, 20% matched, 95% confidence interval [15% to 24%]) and strength of support dimensions (n = 45, 15% matched [11% to 20%]). By contrast, for the alternative vocabulary, most participants implied ranking did match the intended ranking on both the importance (n = 188, 62% matched [57% to 68%]) and strength of support dimensions (n = 201, 67% matched [62% to 72%]). eLifes vocabulary tended to produce less consistent between-person interpretations, though the alternative vocabulary still elicited some overlapping interpretations away from the middle of the scale. We speculate that explicit presentation of a vocabularys intended ordinal structure could improve interpretation. Overall, these findings suggest that more structured and less ambiguous language can improve communication of research evaluations."

Our analysis deepened how horizontal and vertical segregation are combined with symbolic and structural obstacles, as well as economic labor precariousness, within the framework of gender norms. We explored shared trends in the Global North to explore the perpetuation of gender stereotypes in the production of scientific knowledge; and investigated the relationship between the values implied in gender norms and the cultural capital represented in each of the disciplines. As a result, we evidenced that the knowledge areas that currently represent the highest cultural capital (pSTEM) mainly pose symbolic (and less structural) obstacles for women. Conversely, women in fields with less masculine-coded values face mainly structural barriers. This information sheds light on the gender biases that exclude women from STEM."

M.",Lauren A Maggio,2024-05-17,scientific communication and education,"IntroductionFor academics selecting a target journal to submit a manuscript is a critical decision with career implications. In medical education, research conducted in 2016 found that authors were influenced by multiple factors such as a journals prestige and its mission. However, since this research was conducted the publishing landscape has shifted to include a broader variety of journals, an increased threat of predatory journals, and new publishing models. This study updates and expands upon how medical education authors decide which journal to submit to with the aim of describing the motivational factors and journal characteristics that guide authors decision making.

MethodsThe authors conducted five qualitative focus groups in which twenty-two medical education authors and editors participated. During the focus groups participants were engaged in a discussion about how they select a journal to submit their manuscripts. Audio from all focus groups was transcribed. Transcripts were analyzed using codebook thematic analysis.

ResultsParticipants considered multiple factors when selecting a target journal. Factors included a journals impact, the scope of a journal, journal quality, and technical factors (e.g., word limits). Participants also described how social factors influenced their process and that open access plays a role that could both encourage or deter submission.

DiscussionThe findings describe the motivational factors and influential signals that guide authors in their journal selection decision making. These findings confirm, extend, and update journal selection factors reported in medical education and other disciplines. Notably, these findings emphasize the role of social factors, relationships and personal experiences, which were absent from previous work. Additionally, we observed increased consideration of OA and a shift away from an emphasis on journal prestige."

While community-driven efforts, such as the MISEV guidelines (2014, 2018, 2023), have aimed to standardize reporting and enhance experimental rigor, these have not yet been universally adopted in daily EV research practices. The complexity and time commitment required by existing reporting tools can deter researchers from fully embracing them, leading to incomplete or inconsistent documentation in EV studies. Therefore, we created EV-checklist, a complementary digital tool to streamline documentation during manuscript submission and increase transparency for the reviewers, editors and readers. Our tool guides researchers through a straightforward checklist covering nomenclature, source, isolation, characterization, and functional studies of EVs. It generates a concise two-page PDF formatted table for easy integration into manuscripts and provides editors, reviewers, and readers with a clear overview of the conducted studies. EV-Checklist intends to complement existing comprehensive registries as a  fast-and-easy tool to enhance clarity and accessibility of methodological and functional insights. It may also promote higher adherence to documentation standards and in EV studies. Our tool is available on https://ev-zone.org."

The study aims to elucidate the role of preprints during the COVID-19 public health emergency (2020-2023) through a quantitative analysis of journal papers. Among the 247,854 COVID-19-related papers published in PubMed, 12,152 were initially released as preprints and were eventually published in 1,380 journals. This number is more than five times the 246 journals to which submissions can be made directly from bioRxiv through the B2J program. Journals with higher impact factors and Normalized Eigenfactor scores tend to publish a larger number of preprint-derived articles. The proportion of preprints among PubMed papers was 0.049, but this varies significantly by journal. In the top 30 journals, most exceed this proportion, indicating that these journals are preferred by authors for submitting their work. These findings highlight the growing acceptance and impact of preprints in the scientific community, particularly in high-impact journals."

M.; Rocconi, L.; Schussler, E. E.",Maryrose Weatherton,2024-06-10,scientific communication and education,"Classroom experiences elicit many emotions in students. Of these emotions, anxiety, or the feeling of uncertainty about a prospective event, has outsized impacts on students academic achievement and persistence. To understand the effects of student anxiety on student outcomes, education researchers often utilize single or dual-time point (e.g., pre-post) surveys. However, we posit that these methods have significant limitations, including the potential to miss variation in student emotions across time. One methodological solution to this problem is using experience sampling methods (ESM), or short, frequent surveys that capture student experiences as they occur. This study sought to provide evidence of validity for the use of ESM to measure student anxiety in Introductory Biology courses. We compared student anxiety data gathered via ESM and traditional survey methods (i.e., pre-post surveys) in terms of 1) differences in participant recruitment, 2) students experience of anxiety, and 3) the predictive ability on end-of-course outcomes. Our results revealed that: 1) Compared to non-ESM participants, the ESM group has significantly fewer men and had significantly higher perceptions of instructor support, 2) Average anxiety levels measured via ESM were lower and more variable than those measured via pre-post surveys, and 3) Post-survey measures of anxiety and average ESM measures of anxiety significantly predicted students final grade. We discuss the implications of these results for future applications of ESM and pre-post survey methods; specifically, we propose that ESM methods may be more advantageous than pre-post surveys in cases where researchers aim to understand intra-individual processes, like emotions."

T.",Melisa Osborne,2024-06-12,scientific communication and education,"Consciousness of the social impact of science and the potential biases of its authors is critical to understanding, interpreting, and using scientific findings responsibly. This is especially true for sciences concerned with human health and behavior, where societal and unconscious biases may reinforce existing inequities and discriminatory practices. Considering backgrounds and biases, we may notice bias influencing scientists methodological choices and conclusions, even when a work is otherwise scientifically sound. To this end, we created the pedagogical tool Finding inEquity in LIterature and eXperimentation (FELIX). FELIX is a tool that systematizes the detection of bias and subjectivity in scientific communications by using a three-phase progression of (i) Annotation, (ii) Analysis and (iii) Synthesis, where students form a unified argument about the text with a focus on its relationship to social or ethical context. Results from a mixed methods approach indicated the efficacy of our approach in supporting student learning related to reading comprehension, critical thinking skills, and in understanding the social and ethical implications of the research they were reading. We put forward FELIX as a universal method for training students in the reading of scientific communications and as a tool for addressing systemic inequities in science and science education."

J.; Hassall, C.",Cameron Joseph Peacock,2024-06-18,scientific communication and education,"The phenotypic classification of small biological specimens, such as insects, can be dependent on phenotypic features that are difficult to observe and communicate to others. Here, we evaluate how high-resolution 3D photogrammetric scanner technology can potentially allow such features to be resolved and visualised as a 3D models, which can then be shared as a taxonomical resource for species identification, as  virtual type specimens, and for educational and public engagement purposes. We test the viability and limitations of this approach using specimens digitised with a Artec Micro scanner. Ten samples from unique species were mounted and scanned. The model outputs were evaluated against an identification key, which compiled diagnostic features for the specimens from the wider literature, to describe the specimens to the lowest taxonomic level possible. The results showed that six of the ten specimens could be identified to species level using the scans. Threshold values for body length and width were 10.7 mm and 4.4 mm respectively. Below these body dimensions important diagnostic features of specimens could not be resolved reliably. This result suggests that with current technology, 3D photogrammetric modelling is a viable method for taxonomic identification of a wide range of insect groups with larger body sizes. This approach opens up novel applications for species identification and data sharing among taxonomists, international field research, conservation efforts, and entomological outreach. However, the limitations of this approach to taxonomic identification must be considered depending upon the size of the specimen and its diagnostic features. Future developments in the technology and processing methods used may alleviate the constraints on body size exhibited in this study, widening the applications for smaller bodied specimens."

Knight,2024-06-21,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic dramatically altered the landscape of medical education. While patients overwhelmed hospital systems, lockdowns and social distancing recommendations took priority, and medical education was pushed online. Early in 2020, New York State (NYS) was hit especially hard by COVID-19.

ObjectiveThis study sought to understand the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical students well-being and education.

MethodsNYS medical students responded to a six-question survey during April and May 2020. Questions assessed self-reported changes in stress levels, academic performance, and board preparation efforts. Open-ended data was analyzed using a modified grounded theory approach.

Results488 responses across 11 medical schools were included (response rate of 5.8%). Major themes included: standardized test-related stressors (23%), study-related changes (19%), education and training concerns (17%), financial stressors (12%), and additional family obligations (12%).

Second year students reported more stress/anxiety than students in other years (95.9%, p-value< 0.00001). Reported stress/anxiety, effects on exam preparation, and anticipated academic effect varied by geographics.

ConclusionsWhile all NYS medical students reported being greatly affected, those closest to the NY City pandemic epi-center and closest to taking the Step 1 exam were the most distressed. Lack of flexibility of the medical education system during this public health emergency contributed to worsened student well-being. It is time to make plans for supporting the long-term mental health needs of these physicians-in-training and to examine ways the academic medical community can better adapt to the needs of students affected by a large public health emergency in the future."

H.; Rougon-Cardoso, A.; VanBuren, R.",Daniel H Chitwood,2024-06-21,scientific communication and education,"Interdisciplinarity is used to integrate and synthesize new research directions between scientific domains, but it is not the only means by which to generate novelty by bringing diverse perspectives together. Internationality draws upon cultural and linguistic diversity that can potentially impact interdisciplinarity as well. We created an interdisciplinary class originally intended to bridge computational and plant science that eventually became international in scope, including students from the US and Mexico. We administered a survey over four years designed to evaluate student expertise. The first year of the survey included only US students and demonstrated that biology and computational student groups have distinct expertise but can learn the skills of the other group over the course of a semester. Modeling of survey responses shows that biological and computational science expertise is equally distributed between US and Mexico student groups, but that nonetheless these groups can be predicted based on survey responses due to sub-specialization within each domain. Unlike interdisciplinarity, differences arising from internationality are mostly static and do not change with educational intervention and include unique skills such as working across languages. We end by discussing a distinct form of interdisciplinarity that arises through internationality and the implications of globalizing research and education efforts."

P.; Chengula, A.; Kimera, S.; Muunda, E.; Misizo, G.",Julius  Joseph Mwanandota,2024-06-25,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundSustained Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) circulation, as evidenced by surveillance, shows PPR endemicity in Africa and Asia. Regional transmission of PPR is enabled by joining numerous epidemiological factors. Spatial, spatiotemporal and transmission dynamics analytical methods have been used to explore the risk of PPR transmission. The dearth of information on the risk factors associated with spatiotemporal distribution and transmission dynamics of PPR at a regional scale is high. Through a thorough analysis of peer-reviewed literature, this study sought to evaluate the risks of Peste des Petit ruminant virus (PPRV) epidemics by noting distinctions of geographical and spatial-temporal approaches applied in endemic settings.

MethodsA scoping literature review of PPR research publications that used spatial and spatiotemporal approaches to assess PPR risks in endemic areas was carried out using PubMed and Google Scholar data base.

ResultsOut of 42 papers selected 19 focused on Asia, 15 on Africa, and 8 had a global view. 61.9% used clustering analysis while 35.7% used spatial autocorrelation. Temporal trends were described by most studies at about 71.2% while modeling approaches were used by 13 articles (30%). Five risk factors evaluated include demographics and livestock-wildlife interactions (n = 20), spatial accessibility (n = 19), trade and commerce (n = 17), environment and ecology (n = 12), and socioeconomic aspects (n=9). Transmission dynamics of PPR was covered in almost all articles except 2 articles but it has linked all the risk factors.

ConclusionsThe review has contributed to the shifting and improvement of our understanding on PPR outbreaks in endemic settings and support evidence-based decision-making to mitigate the impact of the virus on small ruminant populations. Linkage of other risk factors to livestock trade which is the major driver of livestock movement has been shown to pose a significant risk of PPR epidemics in endemic settings. With many studies being found in Asia compared to Africa, future development of predictive models to evaluate possible eradication strategies at national and regional levels should also consider Africa."

This study introduces a multi-dimensional quantification and visualization approach which can capture two temporal dimensions of a model learning experience: the ""information processing trajectory"" and the ""developmental trajectory."" The former represents the influence of incoming signals on an agents decision-making, while the latter conceptualizes the gradual improvement in an agents performance throughout its lifespan. Tracking the learning curves of a DNN enables researchers to explicitly identify the model appropriateness of a given task, examine the properties of the underlying input signals, and assess the models alignment (or lack thereof) with human learning experiences. To illustrate the method, we conducted 750 runs of simulations on two temporal tasks: gesture detection and natural language processing (NLP) classification, showcasing its applicability across a spectrum of deep learning tasks. Based on the quantitative analysis of the learning curves across two distinct datasets, we have identified three insights gained from mapping these curves: nonlinearity, pairwise comparisons, and domain distinctions. We reflect on the theoretical implications of this method for cognitive processing, language models and multimodal representation.

Author summaryDeep learning networks, specifically recurrent neural networks (RNNs), are designed for processing incoming signals sequentially, making them intuitive computational systems for studying cognitive processing that involves dynamic contexts. There has been a tradition in the fields of machine learning and neuro-cognitive science to examine how a system (either humans or models) represents information through various computational and statistical techniques. Our study takes this one step further by devising a technique for examining the ""learning curves"" of deep learning networks utilizing the sequential representations as part of RNNs architectures. Just as humans develop learning curves when solving problems, the introduced method captures both how incoming signals help improve decision-making and how a systems problem-solving abilities enhance when encountering the same situation multiple times throughout its lifespan. Our study selected two distinct tasks: gesture detection and emotion tweet classification, to illustrate the insights researchers can draw from mapping models learning curves. The proposed method hinted that gesture learning experiences are smoother, while language learning relies on sudden knowledge gains during processing, corroborating the findings from previous literature."

The goal of the program is to support early career scientists interested in pursuing an independent research career with an interdisciplinary focus. In order to assess the benefit of the CASI award on recipients, the authors undertook a retrospective analysis of the funding data for CASI recipients to evaluate success against matching cohorts. These cohorts included applicants who succeeded to the final interview stage but were ultimately unsuccessful (interviewed), applicants who submitted proposals but did not make it to the final interview stage (proposal declined), and a randomly selected dataset of researchers from a comparable program, the highly competitive Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The results indicate that CASI recipients outperformed unsuccessful applicants and their K99/R00 counterparts in federal grant rates and overall grant dollars. The authors conclusion affirms that the CASI mechanism and BWF support successfully achieve the objective of invigorating the careers of young investigators, resulting in tangible downstream long-term effects."

H.",Xin Xia,2024-07-09,scientific communication and education,"AbstractPrevious research has consistently shown students have higher learning interests attitudes, and motivation toward science in elementary compared to middle and high school. However, the key predictors behind the observed differences in engagement levels across grade levels remain unclear. This study aims to identify the association between students perceptions of science instruction and their emotional engagement, as well as examine the differences across various educational stages. A multilevel random effect model was employed to investigate this association. In addition, the analysis examined whether the associations vary between grade levels. A sample of 6465 students from 25 schools participated in the study.

This study shows that students in higher grades have significantly lower emotional engagement compared to third-grade students. Similarly, students in higher grades have significantly lower values on perceptions of science instruction of interesting science and understandable science decrease compared to third grade. Findings reveal significant associations between students perceptions of science instruction, both in perceiving interesting science instruction and understandable science instruction, and their emotional engagement in science learning. The interaction term (Perception of Interesting Science Instruction x Grade) of Grades four, six through eight, and grade 12 are statistically significantly related to emotional engagement, indicating that more positive slopes correspond to high-grade level than third-grade students. The increase in students perception of interesting science has the steepest slope of improvement in students emotional engagement in 6th grade. We find no statistically significant difference between grades in students perception of understandable science and emotional engagement.

Interesting and understandable science classes have positive correlations with students emotional engagement in science learning. For future studies, it is worth exploring science instruction during transition grades to better address and mitigate the observed difference in emotional engagement."

Our students extract and amplify human microbiome DNA using 16S ribosomal RNA specific primers, then construct a sequencing library for Oxford Nanopore based sequencing. They taxonomically assign the sequencing reads, and determine the ecological community composition using relevant software packages. Our students were able to successfully prepare sequencing libraries and analyse the data to produce relevant figures, demonstrating they met the learning objectives of the CURE. Students identified that they had developed higher level learning as defined by Blooms taxonomy, and that their confidence in practical work significantly increased as a result of doing the CURE. We share recommendations for implementation of the CURE in undergraduate curricula, and adaptations of the methods for use in schools outreach. Our CURE successfully provides training for students in genetic analysis in an enjoyable and relatively time and cost efficient manner, preparing them for future research or careers in modern molecular biology techniques."

The difference in the median number of citations between COVID-19 preprint-distributed papers and COVID-19 directly submitted papers published in 184 journals was tested using the Mann-Whitney U test. The results showed that 129 journals had a statistically significant higher median citation count for COVID-19 preprint-distributed papers compared to directly submitted papers, with a p-value of less than 0.05. In contrast, no journals had a statistically significant higher median citation count for COVID-19 directly submitted papers. This indicates that 70.11% of the journals that published preprint-distributed papers experienced a significant increase in citations. We also identified that among the 184 journals, 13 journals garnered a substantial number of citations. Among the 74,037 COVID-19 papers, preprint-distributed papers (9,028) accounted for only 12.19%. However, among the 2,015,997 citations received by COVID-19 papers, preprint-distributed papers garnered 542,715 citations, representing a substantial 26.92%. These results suggest that distributing preprints prior to formal publication may help COVID-19 research reach a wider audience, potentially leading to increased readership and citations."

Such journals also pose a threat for the integrity of science journalism, as journalists may unwillingly report on low quality or even highly flawed studies published in these venues. This study sheds light on how journalists navigate this challenging publishing landscape through a qualitative analysis of interviews with 23 health, science, and environmental journalists about their perceptions of predatory journals and strategies for ensuring the journals they report on are trustworthy. We find that journalists have relatively limited awareness and/or concern about predatory journals. Much of this attitude is due to confidence in their established practices for avoiding problematic research, which largely centre on perceptions of journal prestige, reputation, and familiarity, as well as writing quality and professionalism. Most express limited awareness of how their trust heuristics may discourage them from reporting on smaller, newer, and open access journals, especially those based in the Global South. We discuss implications for the accuracy and diversity of the science news that reaches the public."

Earlier work from our group reported that beyond certain thresholds, academic and career metrics like the number of publications, fellowships or career transition awards, and years of experience did not separate applicants who received job offers from those who did not. Questions still exist regarding how academic and professional achievements influence job offers and if candidate demographics differentially influence outcomes. To continue addressing these gaps, we initiated surveys collecting data from faculty applicants in the biological sciences field for three hiring cycles in North America (Fall 2019 to the end of May 2022), a total of 449 respondents were included in our analysis. These responses highlight the interplay between various scholarly metrics, extensive demographic information, and hiring outcomes, and for the first time, allowed us to look at persons historically excluded due to ethnicity or race (PEER) status in the context of the faculty job market. Between 2019 and 2022, we found that the number of applications submitted, position seniority, and identifying as a women or transgender were positively correlated with a faculty job offer. Applicant age, residence, first generation status, and number of postdocs, however, were negatively correlated with receiving a faculty job offer. Our data are consistent with other surveys that also highlight the influence of achievements and other factors in hiring processes. Providing baseline comparative data for job seekers can support their informed decision-making in the market and is a first step towards demystifying the faculty job market."

Climate-driven changes in pollen seasons present a unique opportunity to craft messaging aimed at communicating climate change impacts on public health through changes in the biological systems. However, it is unclear how pollen seasons are experienced and understood by the public, including how well we detect pollen seasons or what factors we view as responsible for changes in pollen seasons. Here, we use social media data in the United States from 2012 to 2022 to assess public perceptions of pollen seasons at large spatiotemporal scales. We show that pollen seasons detected by social media (Twitter) users align well with natural pollen seasons. Attribution of changing pollen seasons, however, varies based on political ideology: liberal users, compared to conservative users, are more likely to attribute changing pollen seasons to climate change. Mass media and scientific experts play a key role in communicating how climate change drives changing pollen seasons. Our findings reveal how changes in biological systems, political ideology, and scientific communications collectively shape public perceptions of pollen seasons under climate change. Our findings constitute a step towards more effective climate change impact communication and public health intervention design."

The framework categorizes SSI opportunities into three areas: 1) awareness of the issue; 2) socioscientific reasoning; and 3) socioscientific identity. Our analyses of the three countries elementary curricula reveal that the current versions have significant opportunities to explore awareness of SSI (especially relating to environmental and human health issues), promote the development of socioscientific reasoning, and foster socioscientific identity.

We particularly consider the challenges in replicating studies exactly, using the notion of the idealized experiment. We argue against treating reproducibility as an inherently desirable property of scientific results, and in favor of viewing it as a tool to measure distance between an original study and its replications. To sensibly study the implications of replicability and results reproducibility on inference, such a measure of replication distance is needed. We present an effort to delineate such a framework here, addressing some challenges in capturing the components of scientific studies while identifying others as ongoing issues. We illustrate our measure of replication distance by simulations using a toy example. Rather than replications, we present purposefully planned modifications as an appropriate tool to inform scientific inquiry. Our ability to measure replication distance serves scientists in their search for replication-ready studies. We believe that likelihood-based and evidential approaches may play a critical role towards building a statistics that effectively serves the practical needs of science."

G.",Géza Gergely Ambrus,2024-08-07,scientific communication and education,"The ability to recognize and interpret facial expressions is fundamental to human social cognition, enabling navigation of complex interpersonal interactions and understanding of others emotional states. The extent to which neural patterns associated with facial expression processing are shared between observers remains unexplored, and no study has yet examined the neural dynamics specific to different emotional expressions. Additionally, the neural processing dynamics of facial attributes such as sex and identity in relation to facial expressions have not been thoroughly investigated.

In this study, we investigated the shared neural dynamics of emotional face processing using an explicit facial emotion recognition task, where participants made two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) decisions on the displayed emotion. Our data-driven approach employed cross-participant multivariate classification and representational dissimilarity analysis on EEG data. The results demonstrate that EEG signals can effectively decode the sex, emotional expression, and identity of face stimuli across different stimuli and participants, indicating shared neural codes for facial expression processing.

Multivariate classification analyses revealed that sex is decoded first, followed by identity, and then emotion. Emotional expressions (angry, happy, sad) were decoded earlier when contrasted with neutral expressions. While identity and sex information were modulated by image-level stimulus features, the effects of emotion were independent of visual image properties. Importantly, our findings suggest enhanced processing of face identity and sex for emotional expressions, particularly for angry faces and, to a lesser extent, happy faces."

A.; Shi, T.; Chuang, H.-S.; Senapati, S.; Chang, H.-C.",Hsueh-Chia Chang,2024-08-19,scientific communication and education,"Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) are vital for cellular communication and serve as critical biomarker carriers for diseases such as cancer. However, quantifying and profiling sEV surface markers presents significant challenges due to the low concentration of specific sEV-bound proteins and interference by more abundant dispersed proteins. This paper presents Immunojanus Particles (IJPs), a new method that enables the direct detection of sEVs in less than an hour without isolation. The design of IJPs incorporates fluorescent and non- fluorescent halves, utilizing rotational Brownian motion to detect captured sEVs through the change in the blinking rate, without interference from the smaller dispersed proteins. We demonstrate a detection limit of 2E5 sEVs/mL with low sample volumes and the capability to characterize sEVs directly from plasma, serum, cell culture media, and urine. In a small pilot study involving 87 subjects, including individuals with colorectal cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma, Alzheimers disease, and healthy controls, our method accurately identified the type of disease with a high 0.90-0.99 AUC in a blind setting. Compared with an orthogonal ultracentrifugation plus surface plasmon resonance (UC+SPR) method that requires about 24 hours, the sensitivity and dynamic range of IJP are better by 2 logs."

M.; Maloy, J.; Owens, M. T.",Melinda T Owens,2024-08-22,scientific communication and education,"Instructors can provide feedback to their class in multiple ways. One way is through their follow-up behaviors, which are the specific strategies instructors implement after active learning activities. These behaviors could play an important role in student learning as students can receive feedback from the instructor. However, there is little research on the effects of different types of follow-up behaviors. Follow-up after active learning can be seen as a form of discourse between the instructor and the entire class. Previous researchers developed the Classroom Discourse Observation Protocol (CDOP) to analyze discourse between the instructor and individual students or small groups. We used CDOP as a starting point to develop and validate a new protocol, the Follow-Up Discourse Observation Protocol (FUDOP), to characterize instructional follow-up behaviors to the entire class after active-learning activities. We then used FUDOP to characterize follow-up behaviors of multiple instructors in introductory biology courses at three different universities. We measured consistent differences in these behaviors across instructors but not within instructors, demonstrating that instructors may engage in consistent follow-up behaviors. FUDOP could allow instructors and researchers to better measure and analyze follow-up behaviors and their effects, which could in turn provide guidance to instructors and faculty developers."

G.; worku, D.; Bantayhu, M.; Asres, F.",Abebe Gebeyehu Assefa,2024-08-29,scientific communication and education,"Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is one of the most important pulse crops in Ethiopia, contributing to income generation and food security. Information on the genetic variability and trait associations of common bean in the Sekota district of north Western Ethiopia is inadequate. This study was initiated with the objective to assess variability, heritability and trait association among 64 common bean genotypes for quantitative traits using 8x8 simple lattice design at Aybra main research site 2023 under rain fed conditions. Analysis of variance was performed using SAS software and the ANOVA revealed highly significant variations among genotypes for all the traits considered in the study. The yield ranged from 1633.1 to 3702.10 kg ha-1 with a mean of 2542.53 kg ha-1. There was a yield advantage of 24.56 to 55.89% over the checks. A moderate genotypic coefficient of variation coupled with high heritability and high genetic advance as a percentage of the mean was obtained for plant height, branches per plant, hundred seed weight, seed yield, and harvest index. Branches per plant, aboveground biomass and harvest index had significant positive correlations and direct effects on seed yield at the genotypic and phenotypic levels while days to maturity had a significant negative correlation and indirect effect with seed yield at the genotypic. The maximum inter cluster distance was found between clusters VII and 8 (D2 =351.39), followed by clusters V and VIII (D2 =331.23). The first five principal component axes accounted for 74.3% of the total variation, with eigenvalues greater than unity. The number of days to maturity, plant height, number of pods per plant, number seeds per pod, seed yield, and harvest index were the traits that contributed most of the variation in the first PCs. Generally, the presence of variability, and strong positive association of traits among the genotypes were observed in the traits under study. Therefore, selection based on agronomic performance and hybridization based on cluster distance could be possible for the improvement of common bean in the study area."

A.; Kiboi, D.; Akinyi, M. Y.; Tung, J.",Jenny Tung,2024-09-03,scientific communication and education,"Kinship is a major determinant of affiliative and mating behavior in primates. In field studies, identifying kin typically relies in part on genetic analysis, especially for discriminating paternal relationships. Such analyses assume knowledge of Mendelian inheritance, genotyping technologies, and basic statistical inference. Consequently, they can be difficult for students to grasp, particularly through traditional lecture formats. Here, we investigate whether integrating an additional active learning approach--interaction with a Shiny web application, DadApp, which implements a popular paternity inference approach in an accessible graphical user interface--improves student understanding of genetic kinship analysis in molecular primatology. We do so in the context of a non-traditional learning environment in Kenya, a developing nation in which students have limited access to technology, and where the efficacy of educational Shiny apps has never been assessed. Twenty-eight (28) participants with diverse educational backgrounds attended an introductory lecture on genetics and paternity inference, completed a pre-test, interacted with DadApp via a structured set of exercises and questions, and then completed a post-test and survey about their experience and subjective understanding. Post-test scores significantly improved relative to pre-test scores (p-value=3.75 x 10-6 . Further, student interest and confidence in the subject matter significantly increased after the practical session with DadApp. Our results suggest that Shiny web app-based active learning approaches have potential benefits in communicating complex topics in molecular primatology, including in resource-limited settings where such methods have not yet experienced high penetrance.

Unlike traditional linear mRNA vaccines, circRNAs exhibit exceptional stability, enhanced translational efficiency, and resistance to exonuclease degradation, making them ideal candidates for vaccine development. Recent studies have shown that circRNA vaccines play an important and specialized role in cancer treatment. However, there are currently no relevant bibliometric studies. This study aimed to apply bibliometrics and scientometrics to summarize the knowledge structure and research hotspots regarding the role of circRNA vaccines in cancer. Publications related to circRNA vaccines in cancer were searched on the Scopus database. VOSviewer and Scopus were used to conduct the analyses. This study summarizes the research trends and development of circRNA vaccines for cancer and also a comparative analysis between mRNA cancer vaccine and circRNA cancer vaccine identifying potential areas of focus, innovation and growth. This information will provide a reference for researchers to studying circRNA vaccines against cancer due to its increasing trends over recent times."

Previous studies have identified phonological awareness and rapid automatized naming as early predictors. However, the graphic complexity of Arabic letters imposes particular constraints on the visual system, which should mobilize visual attention. To test this hypothesis, 101 Arabic-speaking children who just began their formal reading instruction in Arabic were administered tests of syllable and word reading. Their nonverbal reasoning, vocabulary, phonological awareness, rapid automatized naming and letter knowledge were measured. Their visual attention was estimated through tasks of visual attention span. We found that phonological awareness, visual attention span and letter knowledge were associated with reading outcomes. However, regression analyses showed that the relationship between visual attention span and reading disappeared when letter knowledge was taken-into-account. We used structural equation modeling to examine the direct and indirect effects of visual attention span to reading. Results showed that phonological awareness and letter knowledge were significant and independent predictors of reading while visual attention span contributed only indirectly through its influence on letter knowledge. Our findings suggest that beginning readers rely on visual attention to identify and discriminate visually-complex Arabic letters. In turn, more efficient letter identification in children with higher visual attention facilitates reading acquisition. These findings support the cognitive models of word recognition that include visual attention as a component of the reading system. They open new perspectives for cross-language studies, suggesting that visual attention might contribute differently to reading depending on the orthographic system. They also provide a foundation for innovative teaching methodologies in Arabic language education."

P.; Riedlinger, M.; Maggio, L. A.",Alice Fleerackers,2024-09-04,scientific communication and education,"This study sheds light on how journalists respond to evolving debates within academia around topics including research integrity, improper use of metrics to measure research quality and impact, and the risks and benefits of the open science movement. Drawing on semi-structured interviews with 19 health and science journalists, we describe journalists awareness of these controversies and the ways in which that awareness, in turn, shapes the practices they use to select, verify, and communicate research. Our findings suggest that journalists perceptions of debates in scholarly communication vary widely, with some displaying a highly critical and nuanced understanding and others presenting a more limited awareness. Those with a more in-depth understanding report closely scrutinizing the research they report, carefully vetting the study design, methodology, and analyses. Those with a more limited awareness are more trusting of the peer review system as a quality control system and more willing to rely on researchers when determining what research to report on and how to vet and frame it. We discuss the benefits and risks of these varied perceptions and practices, highlighting the implications for the nature of the research media coverage that reaches the public."

X.",Anne V. Vázquez,2024-09-15,scientific communication and education,"A major challenge for undergraduate students is reading scientific literature. This is especially true in biophysics, where many of the concepts may not have been covered in undergraduate courses. Students can become overwhelmed, which may lead to less overall engagement with the scientific literature. In response, we have developed a guided reading protocol that combines pre-reading strategies, structured notetaking, and ChatGPT to help students clarify unfamiliar concepts in an interactive way. To test the protocol, participants in this study were given an initial survey to determine their experience with reading scientific literature. After this they were given an abridged biophysics paper and the protocol. The ChatGPT transcripts were analyzed using open coding and the students were given a post-study survey. We found most students did not appear to regularly engage with the literature, possibly due to content barriers they encountered. Analyzing their transcripts, we observed that students asked for definitions, explanations, summaries, and simplifications. Overall, students reported that using ChatGPT was a positive experience and they expected to use ChatGPT in the future. From this work, we expect this new protocol may be a way to keep novice students from becoming discouraged when reading scientific papers and keep them engaged with the current literature."

Headlines have a disproportionately large influence on peoples factual knowledge and perceptions of stories covered in media. I tracked online media coverage of one scientific paper involving marbled crayfish and analyzed the headlines used by the articles. Articles were framed as ""news,"" but almost no headlines contained ""new"" facts that first appeared in the target scientific paper. The fact that appeared in the most headlines (that marbled crayfish reproduce by cloning) was over a decade old. Headlines misled readers into thinking a ""breakthrough"" was made by one team, rather than showing incremental advances by many teams of researchers over years."

J.; Chaki, P.; Zohdy, S.",Portia Eastman,2024-09-16,scientific communication and education,"Community-based surveillance and control methods (CBMs) present opportunities to decentralize surveillance and control efforts while simultaneously enhancing community education, leadership, and participation in the fight against vector-borne diseases (VBDs). A scoping review was conducted to describe how CBMs are being utilized currently to combat malaria, dengue fever, Chagas disease, tick-borne diseases (TBDs) and other mosquito-borne diseases (MBD) exclusive of dengue and malaria, and to overall highlight key approaches, lessons learned, potential challenges, and recommendations. A total of 304 potential publications were identified among which 82 met the inclusion criteria. This scoping review highlighted the following benefits to CBMs: cost savings, increased sustainability, increased community knowledge, human behavior changes, increased surveillance coverage, ease in deployment, and the creation of larger, more diverse entomological datasets. Potential challenges highlighted include: participant retention and motivation, participant recruitment and incentives, continued governmental support, data quality, and collaboration with local municipal authorities. CBMs are commonly and successfully used in vector surveillance and control systems, but the chosen vector management method varies by vector-borne disease and region of the world. Additional research is needed to support the implementation of CBMs including cost-effectiveness studies and those studies with negative outcomes. Taken together, this scoping review highlights key aspects, potential challenges, and benefits of CBMs, and outlines potential future directions for incorporating CBMs into VBD control and elimination programming, and potential for community based integrated vector management (IVM) approaches."

J.; Philippon, V.; Liew, A.; Baronikova, S.; Gattrell, W. T.; Gordon, J.; Koskenkorva, T. S.; Mysore, S.; Osorio, J.; Koder, T. J.",Tomas J Rees,2024-09-16,scientific communication and education,"ObjectiveIn biomedical and health sciences, many articles are published open access (OA). Rates of OA publications continue to grow, including for research carried out by pharmaceutical companies. To help drive more openness in the pharmaceutical industry, we aimed to compare the OA publication rates of pharmaceutical companies with those of academic institutions.

MethodsWe assessed OA publication rates from the 40 largest pharmaceutical companies by earnings and 40 comparator academic institutions that publish the largest number of medical research articles in their geographical region. Using the Lens, we built a live public dashboard that presents the OA publication rates for articles with authors affiliated to the pharmaceutical companies and comparator academic institutions of interest, detailed by OA model and licence, and by medical therapy area. We performed further analysis on data downloaded from the dashboard.

ResultsIn our primary analysis of articles 12-24 months since publication date, 76.6% of pharmaceutical company (pharma) and 69.5% of academic institution (academia) publications were OA. The most common OA models were gold (pharma, 37%; academia, 41%) and hybrid (pharma, 22%; academia, 11%). Oncology had lower rates of OA publications than other therapy areas. Growth in the OA publication rate was generally more rapid for pharmaceutical companies than for academic institutions, regardless of field.

ConclusionsThe OA publication rate was higher for pharmaceutical companies than for academic institutions and continues to increase. With the pharmaceutical industry focused on encouraging authors to publish OA and increasingly aware of the different types of OA licences, we expect and welcome further changes. Our new report provides data on pharmaceutical company and academic institution publications that are updated every 2 weeks. We encourage others to use this open resource and report their results.

Key messagesO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topicC_ST_ABSOpen access (OA) publication rates for pharmaceutical companies have been steadily growing. However, previous methods for analysing pharmaceutical company OA publication rates have not been conducive to automation and have not facilitated easy comparison between pharmaceutical companies and other research-intensive environments, such as academic institutions.

What this study addsWe built an online dashboard that presents continually and automatically updated OA publication rates for articles with authors affiliated to several large pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions. We found that the OA publication rate was higher for pharmaceutical companies than for academic institutions and that growth in OA publications was generally more rapid for pharmaceutical companies than for academic institutions.

How this study might affect research, practice or policyOur dashboard allows ongoing monitoring, and we encourage the use of this free tool to capture evolving OA publishing behaviours and the disclosure of these results to help drive greater adoption of OA publishing practices.

Strengths and limitations of this studyO_LIAs expected with large-scale bibliometrics sampling, there are various points at which error and/or information loss may have entered this analysis, for example, during the parsing of author affiliations or categorisation of topics and article types.
C_LIO_LIThe comparator set (a globally representative group of research-intensive academic institutions) may not represent academic institutions in general because it includes only the largest academic institutions (in terms of publication counts) from each global region.
C_LIO_LIThere is overlap between the pharmaceutical company and academic institution analysis sets because first, pharmaceutical company publications often include academic authors, and second, academic institution publications may include pharmaceutical company authors. Hence, some individual publications may have been included in both analysis sets.
C_LIO_LIThe analysis does not account for studies that are led by authors at academic institutions but funded by pharmaceutical companies. These investigator-sponsored studies typically do not have pharmaceutical company authors, and pharmaceutical companies have no influence over decisions relating to publications resulting from these studies, including target journal, OA status and license type.

Plain Language SummaryBiotechnology and pharmaceutical companies develop and deliver most of the worlds new medicines. To ensure important information about these medicines is shared transparently with audiences across the world, more and more often, pharmaceutical companies are choosing to publish their research open access. Open access publishing allows anyone to read and, in some cases, reuse the contents of research publications for free. In medical journals, an increasing proportion of articles are published open access every year. However, at the moment, we dont understand how the open access publication rates of medical publications from pharmaceutical companies compare with those of medical publications from academic institutions. Understanding this could help the scientific community assess how open access publication practices are changing over time.

We made an online platform that provides a free, live report of the open access publication rates for pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions. We found that 77% of pharmaceutical company research publications and 70% of academic institution research publications were published open access. Open access publication rates increased each year for both pharmaceutical company and academic institution research publications, but the rates were increasing faster for pharmaceutical companies.

Our results are similar to those from other studies of open access publication rates. We encourage users to explore our free online live report and share their results publicly. The live report can be accessed using the following link: https://www.lens.org/lens/report/view/Open-access-dashboard/14572/page/14573."
10.1101/2024.09.16.613258,Updated science-wide author databases of standardized citation indicators including retraction data,"Ioannidis, J.; Pezzullo, A. M.; Cristiano, A.; Boccia, S.; Baas, J.",John Ioannidis,2024-09-17,scientific communication and education,"Citation metrics are widely used in research appraisal, but they provide incomplete views of scientists impact and research track record. Other indicators of research practices should be linked to citation data. We have updated a Scopus-based database of highly-cited scientists (top-2% in each scientific subfield according to a composite citation indicator) to incorporate retraction data. Using data from the Retraction Watch database (RWDB), retraction records were linked to Scopus citation data. Of 55,237 items in RWDB as of August 15, 2024, we excluded non-retractions, retractions clearly not due to any author error, retractions where the paper had been republished, and items not linkable to Scopus records. Eventually 39,468 eligible retractions were linked to Scopus. Among 217,097 top-cited scientists in career-long impact and 223,152 in single recent year (2023) impact, 7,083 (3.3%) and 8,747 (4.0%), respectively, had at least one retraction. Scientists with retracted publications had younger publication age, higher self-citation rates, and larger publication volume than those without any retracted publications. Retractions were more common in the life sciences and rare or nonexistent in several other disciplines. In several developing countries, very high proportions of top-cited scientists had retractions (highest in Senegal (66.7%), Ecuador (28.6%) and Pakistan (27.8%) in career-long citation impact lists). Variability in retraction rates across fields and countries suggests differences in research practices, scrutiny, and ease of retraction. Addition of retraction data enhances the granularity of top-cited scientists profiles, aiding in responsible research evaluation. However, caution is needed when interpreting retractions, as they do not always signify misconduct; further analysis on a case-by-case basis is essential. The database should hopefully provide a resource for meta-research and deeper insights into scientific practices."

Our field has demonstrated noticeable gaps in racial, ethnic, and gender diversity, which inhibit our ability to innovate and combat the severe socioeconomic burden of musculoskeletal disorders. Towards this goal, we designed, implemented, and evaluated Learning on a Limb, an orthopaedic research outreach module to teach diverse high school students about orthopaedic research. During the 4-hr module, students completed hands-on activities to learn how biomechanical testing, microcomputed tomography, cell culture, and histology are used in orthopaedic research. Over three years, we recruited 32 high school students from the Greater Philadelphia Area to participate in Learning on a Limb. Most participants identified as racial/ethnic or gender minorities in orthopaedic research. Using pre/post-tests, we found that students experienced significant learning gains of 51 percentage points from completing Learning on a Limb. In addition to teaching students about orthopaedic research, post-survey data demonstrated that participating in Learning on a Limb strongly influenced students interest in orthopaedic research. Several students acted on this interest by completing summer research experiences in the McKay Orthopaedic Research Laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania. Learning on a Limb instructors also benefited by having the opportunity to ""pay it forward"" to the next generation of students and build community within their department. Empowering institutions to host modules like Learning on a Limb would synergistically inspire diverse high school students and strengthen community within orthopaedic departments to ultimately enhance orthopaedic research innovations."

H.; Bertazzo, S.",Sergio Bertazzo,2024-09-19,scientific communication and education,"Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) is widely used as a technique for materials characterization. It has also been successfully applied to the imaging of biological samples, providing invaluable insights into the topography, morphology and composition of biological structures. A particular method combining different SEM detectors, named Density-Dependent Coloured SEM (DDC-SEM), has proven to be most useful for the identification and visualization of minerals in soft tissues. The method consists of a manipulation of original greyscale SEM images to produce coloured images that provide both topography and density information for samples with components of different densities. Here we provide a discussion on how to use DDC-SEM to aid the visualization and intuitive understanding of pathological calcification. This method has become popular not only for its scientific improvement of conventional SEM greyscale images, but also for its aesthetical merits.

Lay summaryScanning Electron Microscopes (SEM) are widely used tools for examining biological materials such as human tissue. Like other electron microscopes, it only produces images in greyscale. SEM has been useful, for instance, in improving our understanding of calcific diseases. These diseases involve the build-up of mineral in the bodys soft tissues, and frequently affect the heart, kidneys, or eyes. This work provides a discussion on using a SEM technique known as Density-Dependent Colour Scanning Electron Microscopy (DDC-SEM), which enhances SEM images through scanning the same area with different detectors, assigning a unique colour to each detectors output, and then overlaying these images."

S.; Blosser, E.; Harvey, R.; Marcette, J.",Rebecca Campbell-Montalvo,2024-09-20,scientific communication and education,"This integrative literature review analyzes the corpus of biology education research published in the main biology education journals of major professional societies. The goal of this analysis is to determine which approaches (including groups of focus, research methods, and settings/perspectives) from social science fields (i.e., psychology, sociology, and anthropology) are utilized in published peer-reviewed biology education research relating to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Scoping how social science approaches are used in this area is important to understanding whether biology education research could benefit from complementary approaches that might advance praxis. This analysis found that research informing the biology education community draws heavily from psychological perspectives that are overwhelmingly not disaggregated (78% of articles identifying a group used a lumped together one), are by far more quantitative (58% used survey, 26% grades, 20% school data) than qualitative (17% used interview, 10% observation), and did not (72%) adopt structural approaches. The addition of missing contributions from social science is critical to advancing interventions to broaden STEM participation given that merging paradigms can offer more robust, multi-level explanations for observed phenomena. This has important implications for education, biology education, biology education research, social science, and research in related STEM fields."

The content of the drawings heavily relies on the task, and the ecological validity of the conclusions is low; 2. The interpretation of drawings relies too much on the subjective feelings of the researchers. To address this issue, this study uses the Large Language Model (LLM) to identify 1420 childrens scientific drawings (covering 9 scientific themes/concepts), and uses the word2vec algorithm to calculate their semantic similarity. The study explores whether there are consistent drawing representations for children on the same theme, and attempts to establish a norm for childrens scientific drawings, providing a baseline reference for follow-up childrens drawing research. The results show that the representation of most drawings has consistency, manifested as most semantic similarity>0.8. At the same time, it was found that the consistency of the representation is independent of the accuracy (of LLMs recognition), indicating the existence of consistency bias. In the subsequent exploration of influencing factors, we used Kendall rank correlation coefficient to investigate the effects of ""sample size"", ""abstract degree"", and ""focus points"" on drawings, and used word frequency statistics to explore whether children represented abstract themes/concepts by reproducing what was taught in class. It was found that accuracy (of LLMs recognition) is the most sensitive indicator, and data such as sample size and semantic similarity are related to it; The consistency between classroom experiments and teaching purpose is also an important factor, many students focus more on the experiments themselves rather than what they explain. In addition, most children tend to use examples they have seen in class to represent more abstract themes/concepts, indicating that they may need concrete examples to understand abstract things."

K.",Dina L Newman,2024-09-24,scientific communication and education,"Molecular biology can be difficult for undergraduate students because course content is often taught using highly-abstract visual representations. Genetic concepts can be depicted with lines, letters, shapes, and symbols, and students need to engage their visual literacy skills to appropriately decipher these abstract representations. We previously found that undergraduate course materials almost always represent chromosomes in abstract forms, such as ""X"" shapes or straight lines with a dot for the centromere. We hypothesized that students struggle to apply their visual literacy skills to accurately interpret these abstract representations of chromosomes, which may be related to the frequently-documented incomplete or incorrect ideas students have about chromosome structure and function. To explore students visual literacy related to representations of chromosomes, we conducted 35 semi-structured interviews with students who had taken at least a year of biology courses. We asked them to sketch chromosomes, interpret an abstract representation of chromosomes, and use the abstract representation to answer a question about meiosis. We found that 97% of participants (34 of 35) held conceptual errors related to chromosome structure and function. These conceptual errors were often not evident in participants verbal definitions of chromosomes and were only revealed in their sketches or explanations of their sketches. We found that participants frequently misinterpreted X-shaped representations of chromosomes, mistook unreplicated homologous chromosomes as separated sister chromatids, and held misconceptions related to the structure and function of centromeres. These findings have implications for how chromosomes are taught in biology courses. We recommend that instructors explicitly discuss the conventions and norms of representing chromosomes as a pathway for increasing students visual literacy in molecular biology."

To date, there is limited understanding about learning strategies in health data science. Therefore, we aim to uncover learning strategies that early career researchers employ to address their educational challenges, as well as shed light on their preferences regarding HDS teaching approach and course design.

MethodIn this study, we conducted a qualitative content analysis through semistructured interviews with ten early career researchers, including individuals pursuing masters, PhD, and postdoctoral research programmes in HDS, across two higher education institutions in the United Kingdom. Interviews were carried out in person from June 2023 to August 2023. Data were analysed qualitatively using NVivo software. Descriptive statistics were employed for quantitative analysis.

ResultsRegarding learning strategies, we identified ten main categories with 22 codes, including collaboration, information seeking, active learning, focus granularity, elaboration, organisation, order granularity, goal orientation, reviewing, and deep learning strategies. Regarding course design and teaching, we discovered four categories with 14 codes, including course materials, duration and complexity, online discussion, and teaching approaches.

ConclusionsEarly career researchers used a range of learning strategies aligned with well-established learning theories, such as peer learning, information seeking, and active learning. It is also evident that learners in HDS favour interactive courses that provide them with hands-on experience and interactive discussion. The insights derived from our findings can enhance the quality of education in HDS."

However, the lack of standardized metadata poses a significant obstacle to big data reuse, necessitating advanced bioinformatics skills for curation and integration.

To tackle this challenge, we organized the Data Hunters Workshop, enabling extensive human skin microbiome metadata curation through student community engagement. The Data Hunters Workshop constitutes a student-science initiative within the University of Milano-Bicocca, Italy. Integrating theoretical and hands-on phases, the workshops structure included a 6-hour lecture, covering metagenomics and metadata manipulation fundamentals, followed by an interactive practical phase designed as a learn-and-play activity. This phase was supported by in-house developed educational online and command-line resources, facilitating students acquisition of Python commands for managing microbiome metadata. Upon the workshops conclusion, its effectiveness was assessed through surveys and standardized evaluation scales.

Twenty-nine students addressed the critical challenge of metagenomics metadata standardization. Workshops resources have equipped students with foundational knowledge in metagenomics and Python programming, empowering them to curate metadata from 379 amplicon-based and shotgun sequencing projects of the human skin microbiome. The collaborative endeavors of these students will ensure the construction of a curated metadata collection.

The Data Hunters Workshop established a reusable model for similar educational aims, facilitating metagenomics and bioinformatics teaching and metadata curation. It bridged education and microbiome research by focusing on human skin microbiome metadata curation, ultimately striving to construct a specific collection promptly accessible to researchers."

Mahajan,2024-10-08,scientific communication and education,"There is a growing number of articles about conversational AI (i.e., ChatGPT) for generating scientific literature reviews and summaries. Yet, comparative evidence lags its wide adoption by many clinicians and researchers. We explored ChatGPTs utility for literature search from an end-user perspective through the lens of clinicians and biomedical researchers. We quantitatively compared basic versions of ChatGPTs utility against conventional search methods such as Google and PubMed. We further tested whether ChatGPT user-support tools (i.e., plugins, web-browsing function, prompt-engineering, and custom-GPTs) could improve its response across four common and practical literature search scenarios: (1) high-interest topics with an abundance of information, (2) niche topics with limited information, (3) scientific hypothesis generation, and (4) for newly emerging clinical practices questions. Our results demonstrated that basic ChatGPT functions had limitations in consistency, accuracy, and relevancy. User-support tools showed improvements, but the limitations persisted. Interestingly, each literature search scenario posed different challenges: an abundance of secondary information sources in high interest topics, and uncompelling literatures for new/niche topics. This study tested practical examples highlighting both the potential and the pitfalls of integrating conversational AI into literature search processes, and underscores the necessity for rigorous comparative assessments of AI tools in scientific research.

Author SummaryAs generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools become increasingly functional, the promise of this technology is creating a wave of excitement and anticipation around the globe including the wider scientific and biomedical community. Despite this growing excitement, researchers seeking robust, reliable, reproducible, and peer-reviewed findings have raised concerns about AIs current limitations, particularly in spreading and promoting misinformation. This emphasizes the need for continued discussions on how to appropriately employ AI to streamline the current research practices. We, as members of the scientific community and also end-users of conversational AI tools, seek to explore practical incorporations of AI for streamlining research practices. Here, we probed text-based research tasks--scientific literature mining-- can be outsourced to ChatGPT and to what extent human adjudication might be necessary. We tested different models of ChatGPT as well as augmentations such as plugins and custom GPT under different contexts of biomedical literature searching. Our results show that though at present, ChatGPT does not meet the level of reliability needed for it to be widely adopted for scientific literature searching. However, as conversational AI tools rapidly advance (a trend highlighted by the development of augmentations in this article), we envision a time when ChatGPT can become a great time saver for literature searches and make scientific information easily accessible."

D.",Sherri L Christian,2024-10-14,scientific communication and education,"Recruitment of faculty members in academic departments shapes the department for decades in both research and teaching arenas. Having a diverse department is beneficial for undergraduate and graduate students as representation of underrepresented minority groups in the professoriate can inspire a greater diversity of students to pursue higher levels of education or research-focused careers. Increased diversity benefits research directly as diverse teams have been shown to have better ideas and outcomes. In 2020, our department had lower gender diversity than would be expected based on the pool of PhD students and post-doctoral fellows in Canada. Therefore, we altered our hiring process, primarily by redacting applications, for recruitment into entry-level tenure-track faculty positions. With this change in process, female hires increased from 17% in the previous ten years (5 hires) to 80% in the subsequent four years (5 hires) with no substantial change in hiring of racially diverse individuals (50% to 40%). Overall, combined with retirements, the percentage of female faculty in the department went from 25% to 50% and the percentage of racialized faculty went from 38% to 44%. The new hires have met or exceeded expectations of success with respect to grant funding and are on track to meet or exceed expectations for other metrics of success. Thus, our intervention was very successful in increasing the diversity of our department within a short timeframe. We believe that our experience could provide other departments with a template for making substantive change, even in the absence of internal expertise in the area.

The current analysis defined precocious citation impact as rising to become a top-cited scientist within t[&le;]8 years after the first publication year. Ultra-precocious citation impact was defined similarly for t [&le;]5 years. Top-cited authors included those in the top-2% of a previously validated composite citation indicator across 174 subfields of science or in the top-100,000 authors of that composite citation indicator across all science based on Scopus. Annual data between 2017 and 2023 show a strong increase over time, with 469 precocious and 66 ultra-precocious citation impact Scopus author IDs in 2023. In-depth assessment of validated ultra-precocious scientists in 2023, showed significantly higher frequency of less developed country affiliation (71%), clustering in 4 high-risk subfields (Environmental Sciences, Energy, Artificial Intelligence & Image Processing, Mechanical Engineering & Transports) (64%), self-citations for their field above the 95th percentile (31%), being top-cited only when self-citations were included (20%), citations to citing papers ratio for their field above the 95th percentile (15%), extreme publishing behavior (7%), and extreme citation orchestration metric c/h2<2.45 (15%) compared with all top-cited authors (p<0.005 for all signals). The 17 ultra-precocious citation impact authors in the 2017-2020 top-cited lists who had retractions by October 2024 showed on average 4 of these 7 signal indicators at the time they entered the top-cited list. While some authors with precocious citation impact may be stellar scientists, others probably herald massive manipulative or fraudulent behaviors infiltrating the scientific literature.

Significance statementExtreme performance may herald either extreme excellence or extreme inappropriate and outright fraudulent practices. Some authors reach the very top ranks in cumulative citation impact within only a few years, while even accomplished scientists take decades to reach these levels, if ever. A science-wide analysis of the authors with the most impressively precocious citation performance reveals that most of them come from less developed countries with limited resources, they heavily cluster in some scientific subfields, and they often have multiple signal indicators that may suggest problematic behavior. Some of these scientists are unquestionably excellent, while others may be manipulative or fraudulent. Evaluation of extreme cases allows science-wide views of the penetration of massive manipulative practices in scientific publication and citation."

S.",Budi Setiadi Daryono,2024-10-16,scientific communication and education,"DNA extraction technology continues to evolve along with the need for a fast and simple process. The DNA extraction with magnetic nanoparticles accommodates these demands by providing a method that is safe, simple, and yet able to give good purity. The purity parameter of the extracted DNA is based on the A260/280 value. This meta-analysis aims to find variables that can affect the purity of extracted DNA using magnetic nanoparticles, based on its extraction and particle synthesis procedure. The information to be analyzed is from DNA extraction from human blood, plasmid extraction, and E. coli gDNA extraction. The research begins with a systematic review to collect appropriate studies and analysis will be carried out using Minitab to find variables that affect the purity of DNA, either positive or negative. Here we show, that no variables have been found significant to the purity of the extracted DNA in both the DNA extraction procedure steps and reagents. For the magnetic nanoparticle synthesis method, for extraction of E. coli gDNA, coating agent TEOS/TiO2; CoZnFe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles, and the interaction between CoZnFe3O4 and TEOS are found to be variables that influence the purity of the extracted DNA based on A260/280. Hopefully, this information can be used as a development idea, either for the magnetic nanoparticle synthesis procedure or the selection of reagents and DNA extraction procedures. In addition, the results of this analysis can also be used for consideration in an in-house magnetic nanoparticle-based DNA extraction assembly."

We uploaded a corpus of three thousand peer reviewed publications on these topics into the RAG. To address concerns about inaccurate responses and GPT  hallucinations, we implemented a context provenance tracking mechanism that enables researchers to validate responses against the original material and to get references to the original papers. To assess the effectiveness of contextual information we collected evaluations and feedback from both domain expert users and  citizen scientists on the relevance of GPT responses.

A key innovation of our study is automated evaluation by way of a RAG assessment system (RAGAS). RAGAS combines human expert assessment with AI-driven evaluation to measure the effectiveness of RAG systems. When evaluating the responses to their questions, human respondents give a ""thumbs-up"" 76% of the time. Meanwhile, RAGAS scores 90% on answer relevance on questions posed by experts. And when GPT-generates questions, RAGAS scores 74% on answer relevance. With RAGAS we created a benchmark that can be used to continuously assess the performance of our knowledge base.

Full GNQA functionality is embedded in the free GeneNetwork.org web service, an open-source system containing over 25 years of experimental data on model organisms and human.

S.",Diana  Eileen Azurdia,2024-10-21,scientific communication and education,"The ability to address the lack of diversity in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math workforce depends on inclusive and equitable training of doctoral students to succeed in the profession. An important metric used to assess equitable training in bioscience doctoral programs is the number of publications that result from a students research. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether there are demographic differences in publication rates among all students in a cohort of bioscience Ph.D. programs at the University of California Los Angeles who graduated between 2011 and 2019. Using institutional data and publication database queries, we determined the number of doctoral publications parsed by authorship position, and the timing of the first publication for each student. The resulting dataset was then analyzed for the relationships between publication categories and student gender, race/ethnicity, and citizenship status. We find that female students published significantly fewer total and co-author papers compared to male students, but had the same number of first-author publications. In contrast, students from underrepresented racial/ethnic groups had fewer first-author papers compared to students from well-represented groups, but similar numbers of total and co-author publications. Publication of the first doctoral paper occurred later for female versus male, and underrepresented versus well-represented students. These results provide evidence for distinct patterns of doctoral publication disparities by gender and race/ethnicity, offering insights into a key metric of bioscience student success and informing potential strategies to achieve equitable outcomes in bioscience doctoral education."

We model thermal field distribution which can help relate surface thermal field images to in-depth temperature field dynamics that show freezing and thawing processes dynamics. We consider the spatio-temporal distribution of temperature using examples of hydrogel and living tissue subjected to a cryoprobe. Freezing in the hydrogel is compared with the measurements using visual morphometry. Such studies can be useful for comparing in-vitro and in-vivo thermal field dynamics and for estimating the correct timing for cryoapplication.

However, its full potential can be harnessed if it is used as a formative instrument. The present study evaluated the benefits of combining individual and group assessments. Students perceptions of this type of strategy, assessed through a Likert scale questionnaire and semi-structured interviews, showed that students acknowledge the benefits of this procedure. We then carried out a dual assessment in an active learning environment. Students were given individual written tests and completed the same test immediately after, but now in a group. The average group scores were higher than the average individual scores, even for students who scored the highest within a group. Put together, these results indicate combining individual and group assessments can be an effective teaching tool in addition to simply measuring student performance."

N.; Rosenzweig, E. Q.; Chen, X.-Y.; Dolan, E. L.",Erin L Dolan,2024-10-28,scientific communication and education,"Science doctoral students can experience negative interactions with faculty mentors and internalize these experiences, potentially leading to self-blame and undermining their research self-efficacy. Helping students perceive these interactions adaptively may protect their research self-efficacy and maintain functional mentoring relationships. We conducted a pre-registered, longitudinal field experiment of a novel perspective-getting intervention combined with attribution retraining to help students avoid self-blame and preserve research self-efficacy. Science doctoral students (n = 155) were randomly assigned to read about mentor perspectives on negative interactions (i.e., Perspective-getting Condition) or about mentoring with no mentor perspective (i.e., control condition). Contrary to our hypotheses, we found no main effects of the intervention on students self-blame or research self-efficacy. However, for students with lower pre-intervention mentorship relationship satisfaction, the intervention preserved research self-efficacy six months later. This study provides evidence that perspective getting may be protective for students who are most in need of relationship intervention.

Educational Relevance and Implications StatementEffective mentoring relationships are fundamental for promoting the success of doctoral students in science, yet not all mentoring relationships are high quality. This study assessed the effectiveness of a brief perspective-getting intervention (where students are given the perspective of what it is like to be a research mentor) that aimed to protect science doctoral students from blaming themselves for negative interactions with faculty mentors and maintain their research self-efficacy. Results showed that on average across all students, the intervention did not affect students self-blame for negative interactions or their research self-efficacy. However, the intervention did help students with less satisfying mentoring relationships maintain their self-efficacy. Thus, perspective-getting shows some promise for protecting science doctoral students from harm that can be caused by negative interactions with faculty mentors."

A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 119 women who had experienced pregnancy, collecting data on craving patterns, maternal health indicators, and perceived influences on family diet. Results revealed that most women craved sugary snacks, predominantly in the second trimester. Notably, 61.9% of participants cravings did not align with their spouses food preferences, suggesting potential shifts in family dietary habits. The study also found associations between cravings, mood swings, and morning sickness, highlighting the complex interplay of physiological and psychological factors during pregnancy. These findings underscore the need for culturally sensitive, personalised prenatal care that address both the nutritional and emotional aspects of pregnancy cravings, influencing long-term family health outcomes."

Data collected were analysed using descriptive statistics of frequency, percentage, mean, and standard deviation, alongside inferential statistics including independent samples t-test and multiple regression analysis. Findings revealed that technical college students from elitist schools displayed a high level of biology proficiency. Significant correlations were found among students conceptual understanding, procedural knowledge, strategic competence, adaptive reasoning, productive disposition, and overall performance in biology. While gender differences in biology proficiency appear to be diminishing across most subscales, subtle gender differences were observed in performance in biology in this study. Gender, conceptual understanding, productive disposition, adaptive reasoning, strategic competence, and procedural knowledge made statistically significant contributions to the variance in technical college students performance in biology. Based on this baseline study, it is recommended that future research in Nigeria should explore the biology proficiency of non-elitist schools, which constitute the majority of educational institutions in the country, to enable broader generalization of these findings."

Data points that exert influence on the fit and its parameters are routinely, but not as often as required, identified by established influence measures and their corresponding cut-off values. In this work, we are specifically concerned with the presence of influential data points that directly impact hypothesis testing of linear regressions, which none of the established measures describe. Interestingly, the highly overlooked influence measure dfstat and its derived leave-one-out p-value exists exactly for this purpose, unmentioned in the majority of statistical text books as well as absent from all available statistical software packages. Its application for identifying these data points seems pivotal, as scientific reasoning in publications is almost exclusively based on the p-value of the fit, commonly adhering to the  = 0.05 threshold to state significance or not. With this metric, we found for 29 of 100 digitizable papers published in Science, Nature and PNAS in 2016, a time when the ""reproducibility crisis"" was a growing concern, that stated significances (or their absence) are based on the presence of a single influential data point."
10.1101/2024.10.29.620999,A survey of the mentor-mentee relationship in early career research (ECR): Implications for publishing and career advancement in the STEMM disciplines,"Lordan, R.; Wride, M.; O'Sullivan, I.",Ronan Lordan,2024-10-30,scientific communication and education,"Early career researchers (ECRs) are the most abundant workforce in the fields of science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine (STEMM). ECRs are generally mentored by experienced principal investigators (PIs) who direct the research objectives. The ECR mentee- mentor partnership can be mutually beneficial, but it is a critical relationship for ECRs with implications for publishing and career development. In this study, a mixed methods approach involving a survey, X polls (formally Twitter), and semi-structured interviews were used to determine how the ECR mentor-mentee relationship affects ECRs and their perceptions of career development in STEMM. To address this aim, two main research questions were developed: (1) Who do the STEMM ECR mentees and mentors currently perceive to be ECRs? and (2) What characteristics of the ECR mentee-mentor relationship are perceived to be important for ECR publishing practices and career progression? The main survey findings indicate that respondents largely from the life sciences and health field and they consider Ph.D. researchers and postdoctoral researchers as ECRs, but mentors also to a greater extent than mentees perceive new PIs (< 2 years experiences) as ECRs. Survey respondents also mostly agree on publishing practices regarding journal selection criteria such as journal scope and impact factor, although mentees appear to favor journal prestige and open access publishing more than mentors. This is likely due to the importance of visibility early in ones career. Mentees take the lead in preparing manuscripts for submission, although a minority have described issues regarding authorship disputes. Finally, setting clear expectations, being collegial, mutually respectful, and having regular communication was identified by survey respondents and interviewees as integral features of a healthy ECR mentee- mentor relationship. In conclusion, the mentee-mentor relationship is critically important for ECR career development, and the findings of this study have wider implications for the development of effective ECR mentee and mentor training programs across the STEMM disciplines."

This study aimed to develop and evaluate a structured educational program for caregivers of children with T1DM, facilitated by an interprofessional team.

MethodsThis mixed-method study, conducted from May 15 to August 15, 2023, comprised two parts. First, a structured educational module was developed based on a needs assessment from semi-structured interviews with 20 caregivers. The module was created in English, Hindi, and Khortha (the local language of Deoghar, Jharkhand, India) and validated by a panel of 10 experts (CVI = 0.83). It was delivered using audio-visual aids, live demonstrations, posters, and booklets. The programs effectiveness was evaluated through a pre-post-test questionnaire.

ResultsThe interviews revealed themes such as misunderstandings of treatment plans, distress from frequent insulin administration, fear of glucose monitoring, financial burdens, and psychological stress. Data from 68 of the 75 caregivers who participated in the educational program were analyzed. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test indicated a significant improvement in caregiver knowledge and management practices (P < 0.001), with a large effect size (Cohens d = 3.2).

ConclusionThis study demonstrates that structured educational interventions can significantly enhance caregivers knowledge and practices in managing T1DM. Multidisciplinary education and support are crucial for addressing the emotional and financial burdens caregivers face, ultimately improving the well-being of both caregivers and children."

E.",Andrew Jeffrey Fraass,2024-11-08,scientific communication and education,"Despite the critical role of graduate students in the Canadian research ecosystem1, students report high levels of financial stress2. We collected graduate minimum stipends and tuition data from all university graduate programs in Canada in Ecological Sciences/Biology and Physics, along with cost of living measures for the cities in which they reside. This data is heterogeneous, complex, and in many cases simply not publicly available, making it challenging for potential graduate students to understand what support they should expect. We show Canadian minimum stipends are at values almost exclusively below the poverty threshold. Only two of 140 degree programs offered stipends which meet cost of living measures after subtracting tuition and fees. For graduate programs which offered a minimum guaranteed stipend, the average minimum domestic stipend is short [~]Can$9,468 (international [~]Can$16,899) of the poverty threshold after accounting for payment of tuition and fees. On average, approximately 34% of a minimum stipend is returned to the university by a domestic Canadian student and 78% (57% median) by an international student, though there are important caveats with the international student comparison. While international comparison is difficult, the highest Canadian minimum stipend is roughly equivalent or lower than the lowest stipend within the largest dataset of United States of America (US) Biology stipends 3, and lower than the United Kingdom (UK) stipend. University endowment correlates with minimum stipend amount but intra- and inter-institutional differences suggest it is not solely institutional wealth which improves graduate pay. Canada is behind comparable countries in funding the next generation of scientists. Canadians who desire higher STEM education have three options: hope for significantly higher guaranteed support from a supervisor, department, or awards; incur substantial debts; or emigrate."

To analyze these journals characteristics, this study introduced the concepts of paper ratio, citation ratio, and citation impact. Journals with similar trends in paper and citation count were positioned near the diagonal on a two-dimensional graph (y=x) with paper ratio on the x-axis and citation ratio on the y-axis, indicating a slope close to 1. Conversely, the greater the disparity between paper ratio and citation ratio, the wider the angle between the journals position and the diagonal. Of the 110 journals in 2020, 83 were above the diagonal with a citation impact greater than 1, while 27 were below the diagonal with a citation impact of 1 or lower. Notably, nine journals--BMC Health Services Research, Genome Medicine, Nature, Annals of Epidemiology, BMC Bioinformatics, Nature Microbiology, PLoS Computational Biology, Medicine (Baltimore), and Journal of Clinical Investigation--showed high citation impact, with preprint-distributed papers being cited nearly five times more than directly submitted papers. This study demonstrates that articles initially distributed as preprints in these journals tend to receive substantially more citations than directly submitted ones."

A.",Alberto Amado Rascon Jr.,2024-11-13,scientific communication and education,"The restructuring of an upper division biochemistry lab capstone course intended for biochemistry students with a range of laboratory experience was explored. A goal of the course was to give students practice with necessary skills in biochemical and biological techniques, especially for an entry level general position in biotechnology. The immediate impact of the online capstone course mandated by the COVID-19 pandemic limited students on learning essential hands-on research skills but evolved during the transition back to in-person instruction to include more elements of in-person practice. This article highlights the evolution of the capstone biochemistry lab to an in-person CURE capstone lab, with lessons learned and resources successfully used during the COVID-19 remote course. These include changes in the way information was disseminated, access to online resources, and modifications in student assessments. This article documents how course evolution resulted in a shift in pedagogical strategies leading to building a community of biochemistry learners that could be used to help college faculty in developing a CURE capstone lab."

While debate on the quality of GenAI outputs continues, there is optimism that GenAI may help human experts to address the most significant environmental challenges facing society. No previous research has quantitatively assessed the quality of GenAI outputs intended to inform environmental management decisions. Here we surveyed 98 environmental scientists and used their expertise to assess the quality of human and GenAI content relevant to their discipline. We analysed the quality and relative preference between human and GenAI content across three use cases in environmental science outreach and communication. Our results indicate that the GenAI content was generally deemed adequate in quality by human experts, with an average of 82% of respondents indicating a quality of ""adequate"" or better across the three use cases. Respondents exhibited strong preferences for GenAI over human-only content when using GenAI imageery of future park management scenarios. For the use cases of generating a wetland planting guide and answering a question about invasive species management, preferences were heterogeneous amongst respondents. Our findings raise substantive questions about GenAI content as a complement to human expertise when research is transferred to public audiences."

How it impacted Canadian early-career health researchers (ECHRs) remains unclear. We administered a survey to understand the composition of ECHRs in Canada, their job experiences, and experiences of burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic.

MethodsA cross-sectional survey was conducted in May 2023 of Canadian ECHRs defined as within 7 years of their first independent research position. Quantitative analyses included a description of respondents by research pillar, socio-demographic and workplace characteristics, and the prevalence of burnout, disengagement or exhaustion. Sample characteristics were compared to national data on ECHRs from a Canadian funding agency. Thematic analysis of free-text responses was also conducted.

ResultsA total of 225 respondents met the eligibility criteria. Most respondents were assistant professors and characteristics of our sample were like the national data. The COVID-19 pandemic posed many challenges to student recruitment, and emotional support of students, with over half of the respondents reporting a moderate to significant decline in mental health compared to pre-pandemic. A significant proportion of respondents were experiencing high burnout (62%, 95%CI:56-67%), exhaustion (64%, 95%CI: 57-70%) or disengagement (91%, 95%CI: 87-95%). Thematic analysis identified three themes: ongoing benefits/problems preceding the pandemic, unintended outcomes of strategies to manage/prevent/contain COVID-19, and reasons to stay in their current position.

ConclusionsOur survey revealed that Canadian ECHRs reported many diverse challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic and high burnout, putting the sustainability of this workforce at risk. Improved systems are needed to understand the long-term impacts and support the future of the Canadian health research ecosystem."

Because error bars and box plots can show different measures, they must be labelled to be interpretable. Of graphs of averages shown at a scientific conference in 2020, 87.5% of graphs did not contain enough information on the slide to interpret them. The only graphs that were fully interpretable (12.5%) were bar graphs. By comparison, 92% of graphs of averages published in a journal in the same field contained enough information to interpret them. While conferences are not and should not be as stringent about data presentation as journals, that a statistical value as simple as an average are not clearly presented suggests graphs are created by rote."

J.; TERMOTE, C.",Bissola  Malikath Verena BANKOLE,2024-11-15,scientific communication and education,"Malnutrition is a global problem driven by food systems that impact climate and biodiversity. Neglected and underutilized species (NUS) could improve diets, but what drives their choices and consumption, particularly in low and middle-income countries, is poorly documented. This study investigated the influences of the personal food environment on the consumption of NUS in three communities in the department of Atacora in northern Benin. Following a purposive sampling strategy, 24 semi-structured interviews were conducted with local and 18 with professional experts. 12 group discussions with villagers from six villages in the three communes complemented and deepened the information gathered, focusing on both barriers and factors for enhancing consumption. The data collected was translated and transcribed into French and analyzed using qualitative content analysis with Atlas.ti software. Among the investigated plant parts, an upward trend was found for Moringa oleifera leaves and Vigna radiata seeds, a downward trend for Adansonia digitata pulps, and a varied trend for Ocimum gratissimum leaves and Adansonia digitata kernels and leaves. Drivers for changes in consumption were found in all four dimensions of the food environment. Among the plant parts with the main increasing trend in consumption, various aspects of desirability, above all increased food and nutrition knowledge and skills, led to a positive consumption trend. The downward trend has most often been attributed to declining accessibility, but several aspects have also made these plant parts less affordable and less desirable (taboos for example). The strong variation in dimensions influence on plant parts with variable trends reflects their non-unanimous changes. Research and policies should address the factors influencing the consumption of these foods. Making neglected species more accessible, affordable, and desirable can enhance food security and environmental sustainability."

Using open data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and Wikidata, we aimed to uncover geographic and historical trends in specimen use. This study aims to provide concrete evidence to guide collaboration between collection-holding institutions and the communities that need their resources most.
C_LIO_LIWe analysed biodiversity specimens from Montserrat and the Cayman Islands in three steps. First, we extracted specimen data from GBIF, disambiguated collector names, and linked them to unique biographical entries. Next, we connected collectors to their publications and specimens. Finally, we analysed the modern use of these specimens through citation data, mapping author affiliations and research themes.
C_LIO_LISpecimens are predominantly housed in the Global North and were initially used by their collectors, whose focus was largely on taxonomy and biogeography. With digitisation, use of these collections remains concentrated in the Global North and covers a broader range of subjects, although Brazil and China stand out as significant users of digital collection data compared to other similar countries.
C_LIO_LIThe availability of open digital data from collections in the Global North has led to a substantial increase in the reuse of these data across biodiversity science. Nonetheless, most research using these data is still conducted in the Global North. For the non-monetary benefits of digitisation to extend to the countries of origin, capacity building in the Global South is crucial, Open Data alone are insufficient.

Societal Impact StatementDigital biodiversity data from herbaria and museums hold significant potential for nature conservation in the Global South, yet many regions, like Montserrat and the Cayman Islands in the Caribbean, are, for multiple reasons, unable to fully leverage this information. This lack of skills and resources limits local conservation efforts, showing the need for more investment in training, facilities, and expertise. Although past funding has helped improve coordination and build skills, our findings show that more work is needed to make sure conservation in these biodiverse areas can continue in the long term."

Therefore, individuals sometimes create hoaxes to test whether editorial processes are as robust as they are claimed, or whether they are done at all. This article tracks the occurrence of hoaxes aimed at scholarly publishers and academic conferences since 2000. Since 2009, successful hoaxes usually appeared at a year of one or more a year, usually motivated by academics or journalists exposing so-called ""predatory"" journals. The apparent rise in the number of hoaxes reflects a lack of transparency in editorial processes at both legitimate and ""predatory"" journals. Reaction of academic communities to hoaxes varies widely depending on the perceived intent of the target of the hoaxes and whether the hoax demonstrates what the hoaxer claims."

Python, known for its versatility and powerful libraries, has become a crucial tool for managing these datasets. However, there is a significant lack of programming training for bioscientists in many countries. To address this knowledge gap among scientists in Brazil, the Brazilian Python Workshop for Biological Data was introduced several years ago, focusing on basic programming concepts and data handling techniques using popular Python libraries. Despite the progress and positive feedback from earlier editions, challenges persisted, necessitating continuous adaptation and improvement to meet the evolving needs of bioscientists.This work describes the advancements made in the 2021 and 2022 editions of the workshop and discusses new suggestions for its ongoing enhancement. Key innovations were introduced in the workshop structure and coordination, including the creation of new committees and the establishment of a code of conduct. Feedback forms were updated to enable real-time adjustments during the event, improving its overall effectiveness. The workshop also expanded its reach by increasing geographical diversity among participants. New didactic strategies, such as pair-teaching, code clubs, and the integration of information and communication technologies (ICTs), were implemented to enhance learning outcomes. Programming best practices and scientific reproducibility were emphasized through talks and hands-on activities, guided by PEP8 conventions. Furthermore, efforts to enhance scientific dissemination were intensified, with an increased presence on social media and participation in international scientific events and communication networks. Finally, we present updated recommendations for students, researchers, and educators interested in organizing and promoting similar events, building on those previously described."

A.",Gustavo Adolfo Montano Medina,2024-12-02,scientific communication and education,"This study analyzed how the dimensions of divergent thinking (PD)--fluency, flexibility, originality, and elaboration--impacted quality and innovation in scientific production at a university in the Dominican Republic. Using a quantitative approach based on a Structural Equation Model (SEM), the relationships between the DP, the creative personality (PC) and the indicators of quality and scientific innovation were examined. The sample included 296 participants, composed of graduate students, researchers, and administrative staff, who completed structured questionnaires adapted to the Dominican context. The findings demonstrated that flexibility and originality were the most influential factors within the DP, positioning them as key predictors of academic creativity and scientific output (coefficient = 1.98, p < 0.001). In addition, it was identified that the CP acted as a significant mediator in the relationship between the PD and the quality of the research (coefficient = 0.495, p < 0.001). The analysis of social networks (SRA) showed that individuals with high creativity occupied central positions in collaborative networks, improving knowledge transfer and fostering interdisciplinary environments. This study underscored the importance of promoting educational strategies that stimulate creativity and innovation in academic contexts. It was recommended to implement integrative programs of divergent thinking skills, collaborative spaces for researchers and students, and policies that encourage creativity in scientific projects. The limitations of the cross-sectional design and reliance on self-reports highlighted the need for future research with longitudinal methods and qualitative techniques. These findings contributed to the understanding of how to optimize creativity and PD in academic institutions, reinforcing their impact on knowledge generation and scientific advancement in Latin American contexts.

Author summaryCreativity and innovation are key factors for progress in all disciplines, particularly in academic and scientific research. This study examines the impact of divergent thinking (a cognitive process characterized by generating multiple solutions to a problem) on the quality and novelty of scientific research. The research, conducted at a Dominican university, focused on four key dimensions of divergent thinking: fluency (the number of ideas generated), flexibility (the ability to adapt ideas to diverse contexts), originality (the generation of unique ideas), and elaboration (the depth and detail applied to ideas).

By using structured surveys and advanced statistical models, the results reveal that originality and flexibility are the most influential factors in fostering creativity and improving the quality of research. In addition, people with pronounced creative personalities, marked by openness to new experiences and the assumption of intellectual risks, were identified as central figures in collaborative academic networks. These individuals not only improved the quality of their own work, but also contributed to fostering innovation within their professional communities.

The study highlights the need to implement institutional strategies that foster creativity in academic settings. Recommendations include promoting interdisciplinary collaboration, offering specific training programs for creative problem-solving, and providing institutional support for innovative research initiatives. Such efforts can significantly improve the ability of universities to generate breakthrough discoveries and equip students and researchers with the capabilities needed to address complex global challenges.

By highlighting the vital role of creativity and divergent thinking in academic research, this study provides useful information for higher education institutions seeking to advance scientific knowledge and innovation in the twenty-first century."

Using published undergraduate research on Hydra mouth opening to train undergraduates,"Hackler, S.; Goel, T.; Pacis, J.; Collins, E.-M.",Stephen Hackler,2024-12-07,scientific communication and education,"Biophysical research is both exciting and challenging. It is exciting because physical approaches to biology can provide novel insights, and it is challenging because it requires knowledge and skills from multiple disciplines. We have developed an undergraduate biophysical laboratory module that is accessible to both biology and physics majors, teaches fundamental skills such as time-lapse microscopy, image analysis, programming, critical reading of scientific literature, and basics of scientific writing and peer-review. This module uses published research on the biomechanics of Hydra mouth opening as its framework because this work was co-first authored by an undergraduate student and featured in the public press, thus providing two anchors that make this research accessible and exciting to undergraduates. Students start with a critical reading and discussion of the publication. Then they execute some of the experiments and analysis from the paper, thereby learning fluorescence time-lapse microscopy and image analysis using ImageJ and/or MATLAB/Python, and compare their data to the literature. The module culminates in the students writing a short paper about their results following the Micropublication journal style, a blinded peer-review, and final paper submission. Here, we describe one possible implementation of this module with the necessary resources to reproduce it, and summarize student feedback from a pilot run. We also provide suggestions for more advanced exercises. Several students expressed that repeating a published study done by an undergraduate student inspired and motivated them, thus creating buy-in and assurance that they ""can do it"", which we expect to help with confidence and retention."

We use publication metadata from a global bibliometric database (raw Scopus data at the micro-level of individual scientists). In a cohort-based and longitudinal fashion, we follow individual men and women scientists over time, from their first to their last publication (N=86,178). We examine four academic disciplines: AGRI (agricultural and biological sciences), BIO (biochemistry, genetics, and molecular biology), IMMU (immunology and microbiology), and NEURO (neuroscience). We apply survival analysis, conceptualizing scientific life as a sequence of scholarly publishing events. Our Kaplan-Meier survival analysis shows how women disappear from science: in BIO, about 60% are still in science after 5 years, 40% after 10 years, and only 20% by the end of the period examined (i.e., after 19 years). The percentages are substantially higher for men: approximately 70%, 50%, and 30%, respectively. Kaplan-Meier estimations indicate that women in the largest discipline (BIO) are 23.26% more likely to leave science after 10 years and 39.74% more likely to leave science at the end of the study period. Gender difference in attrition, slightly visible after 5 years, increase consistently in later career stages. The probability of surviving for women after 15 years varies considerably, from 47.8% in AGRI to 27.6% in IMMU; for men, the probability is about a fifth higher. Our data show that with the passage of time, women disappear from science in ever-larger proportions compared to men. Gender differences in attrition in the four disciplines have been and continue to be high, but comparing the 2000 and 2010 cohorts, have slightly decreased over time."

High impact research needs reliable, decisive, and holistic approaches to leadership, but managerial and leadership skills are often considered an  add-on as opposed to a necessity in modern research environments. An estimated 70% of EDI initiatives in UK Higher Education Institutions fail to flourish (Marchiondo et al. 2023) - a combinatory effect of conservative approaches to change, cultural adaptation, and departmental stability.

We developed an Inclusive Leadership Programme to empower bioscientists to work autonomously and inclusively. Using a co-creation approach, the Inclusive Leadership Programme collectively defined inclusive leadership traits to create a resource. The interactive resource shares inclusive approaches to communication, feedback, recognition, and development - prioritising the experiences of those typically excluded from leadership conversations. By embedding a self-reflective scoring system, we share changes in approaches to inclusivity. After using the resource, self-perception normalises in distribution, indicating the resource provides a baseline for best practice, and space to understand personal approaches to inclusive practice in biosciences.

Ultimately, the Inclusive Leadership Programme and Resource offers a template for other biological research, learning, and teaching environments to build their own tailored approach to integrating inclusivity and empowering all members to work as autonomous and inclusive leaders, regardless of seniority."

Recently, in recognition of the value of open science, funding agencies have begun to mandate open science policies as a condition in grantee awards. However, operationalization and implementation of an open science policy can have unanticipated costs and logistical barriers, which can impact both the funder, as well as the grantee. These factors should be considered when implementing an open science policy.

The Aligning Science Across Parkinsons (ASAP) initiative utilizes a comprehensive open science policy, which, in addition to requiring immediate free online access to all publications, also requires all newly-generated datasets, protocols, code, and key lab materials be shared by the time of publication. Moreover, preprints must be posted to a preprint repository by the time of manuscript submission to a journal for review.

Here, we outline the potential costs associated with implementing and enforcing this open science policy. We recommend that funders take these considerations into account when investing in open science policies within the biomedical research ecosystem."

Most taxa and reasons could lead to both increase or decrease in feeding, although the direction was context-dependent. We suggest that bird-feeding is an interactive process where the species community strongly affects feeding practices, which in turn can affect community composition. Recognising this process is crucial for understanding the effects of bird-feeding on both humans and nature and providing more nuanced guidance."

C.; Merritt, A.; Bansal, S.",Shweta Bansal,2024-12-20,scientific communication and education,"Publication practices accumulate to affect credibility and career advancement. Understanding authorship and citation practices is critical to addressing inequities. While citation bias has been demonstrated in several fields, it remains uncharacterized in infectious disease dynamics (IDD), a quantitative, interdisciplinary domain highly visible during the COVID-19 pandemic. We analyze IDD articles and their bibliographies from 2000-2019 using machine-learning algorithms to infer the gender and race/ethnicity of each articles lead and senior author. We examine authorship and citation patterns by gender and racial group across geographic scales, including characterizing the author composition of each articles bibliography relative to the field. Our analysis reveals persistent gender and race imbalances in IDD research. Man-authored and White-authored publications dominate the field, with little progress in racial diversification of US and UK publications over the last two decades. Woman-authored articles have the most representative citation practices but are undercited, especially when women are senior authors. In the US and UK, most citations feature White lead and senior authors, even when citing articles have lead or senior authors of color. These findings underscore the urgent need for more inclusive IDD research practices. We discuss possible mechanisms and solutions to create opportunities for researchers from underrepresented groups."

In contrast, faculty have not reached a consensus concerning the learning goals for introductory non-majors courses. Yet, more than 8 out of 10 undergraduates are not science majors. The goal of this study was to develop and evaluate learning objectives for non-majors introductory biology courses. We performed a modified-Delphi study of learning objectives (LOs) for non-majors biology. We engaged a total of 38 biology faculty experts from institutions across the US in three iterative rounds to identify, rate, discuss, and re-rate >300 LOs for non-majors biology courses. Faculty provided feedback to determine whether the LOs are critical for students to learn and if the LOs encompass what students need to learn about this issue, as well as if anything is missing. As a result of expert evaluation, 60.7% of LOs (164) were deemed critical. Experts also suggested 22 additional new LOs."

This paper aimed to explore parents and teachers viewpoints and roles on play in promoting early learning and development in children, which has little emphasis in existing studies. This paper employed a cross-sectional study using a mixed-method approach to gather data from preschool teachers (n=96), parents (n=126), and policy implementers (n=6) in Kenya. We used questionnaires, focus group discussions, and interview guides to collect qualitative and quantitative data through face-to-face interviews with teachers and parents and mobile interviews with policy stakeholders. We performed qualitative analysis through reviewing the study transcripts, coding, and generating emerging themes that later guided the draft of the narrative report. Quantitative data were coded, cleaned, and reviewed before they were descriptively computed on the Stata version 18 to generate graphic representations. Our findings revealed that teachers and parents jointly perceived play to be pivotal on childrens learning and development. In addition, parents and teachers recognized that it is their role to engage children in play, provide play materials, and supervise children. Based on our results, we suggest that preschool teachers and parents collaboratively identify days to jointly develop play materials in preschool centers. This strategy may present a better understanding of the adults primary role of facilitating play and play-based learning. Our findings may serve as a resource and source of information for preschool teachers, parents, and policy stakeholders to consider play not only as a development pathway but also an element of learning and contributor to school readiness in children."

Kate Wright,2024-12-26,scientific communication and education,"Visual models are a necessary part of molecular biology education because submicroscopic compounds and processes cannot be directly observed. Accurately interpreting the biological information conveyed by the shapes and symbols in these visual models requires engaging visual literacy skills. For students to develop expertise in molecular biology visual literacy, they need to have structured experiences using and creating visual models, but there is little evidence to gauge how often undergraduate biology students are provided such opportunities. To investigate students visual literacy experiences, we surveyed 66 instructors who taught lower division undergraduate biology courses with a focus on molecular biology concepts. We collected self-reported data about the frequency with which the instructors teach with visual models and we analyzed course exams to determine how instructors incorporated visual models into their assessments. We found that most instructors reported teaching with models in their courses, yet only 16% of exam items in the sample contained a visual model. There was not a statistically significant relationship between instructors self-reported frequency of teaching with models and extent to which their exams contained models, signaling a potential mismatch between teaching and assessment practices. Although exam items containing models have the potential to elicit higher-order cognitive skills through model-based reasoning, we found that when instructors included visual models in their exams the majority of the items only targeted the lower-order cognitive skills of Blooms Taxonomy. Together, our findings highlight that despite the importance of visual models in molecular biology, students may not often have opportunities to demonstrate their understanding of these models on assessments."

I.",B Ian Hutchins,2024-12-26,scientific communication and education,"Concerns over research integrity are rising, with increasing attention to potential threats from untrustworthy authors. We established a framework to gauge the potential negative influence of researchers potentially engaged in misconduct. The field of Alzheimers Disease (AD) research has been a focal point of these worries. This study aims to assess the risk posed by questionable studies or individuals potentially engaging in fraudulent science in research by examining citation relationships among papers, taking AD research as an illustrative example. Analysis of citation network structure can elucidate the potential propagation of misinformation arising at the author level. Our analysis revealed that there arent any single authors or papers whose citation connections jeopardize a major portion of the fields literature. This indicates a low probability of single entities undermining the majority of works in this area. However, our findings suggest that attention to research integrity of the most influential scientists is warranted. Some scientists can reach a sizable minority of the literature through citations to their work. Emphasizing oversight of the integrity of these authors is crucial, given their influence on the field. Our study introduces an analytical framework adaptable across various fields and disciplines to evaluate potential risks from fraudulence."

The framework integrates logical thinking, creativity, and adaptability to enhance scientific writing skills and communication competencies. The experiment involved a four-semester university program guiding students from creative writing to complex scientific article production within diverse multidisciplinary contexts. The proposed methodology is also applicable in research institutions, corporate training programs, and other roles requiring proficiency in multidisciplinary scientific writing.

The findings demonstrate that the framework significantly improved students reasoning, structured thinking, and innovation capabilities, enabling them to present novel ideas effectively in academic settings. A key outcome of the program was the advancement of metacognitive awareness, supported by AI tools, allowing students to critically evaluate and refine their work. Additionally, the study highlighted the role of AI in enhancing the structural and stylistic quality of scientific writing while addressing ethical considerations.

The sequential design of the methodology and the multidisciplinary environment fostered knowledge exchange among students from various disciplines, preserving the unique attributes of each field. The five-step analysis framework, used to compare the outcomes of experimental and control groups, revealed statistically significant advantages for students participating in the methodological program. This research underscores the importance of multidisciplinary approaches for advancing 21st-century scientific literacy and emphasizes the global adaptability of such innovative programs."

These students often face serious challenges during their undergraduate years, such as navigating unfamiliar academic systems, balancing demanding coursework with work responsibilities, and fulfilling family obligations. These and other systemic pressures can impede their academic progress and opportunities for research experience. We therefore asked how their undergraduate GPA impacted success in the PhD in terms of (i) acceptance, (ii) completion, and (iii) time to degree after participating in a funded MS research training program. We examined data collected at San Francisco State University and California State University, Los Angeles over a 30-year period because they (i) had similar student demographics, (ii) were institutions with strong MS degrees, and (iii) had an infrastructure (established offices) to coordinate various training programs. We found that high GPA did not predict greater success in entering or completing the PhD, or in time to degree. This study, therefore, demonstrates that undergraduates from diverse groups with lower undergraduate GPA levels can benefit from a structured MS research training program in reaching their goal of becoming a PhD scientist. Moreover, it indicates that more holistic approaches in admissions are required, including limiting the use of a GPA below 3.0 as an early filter to eliminate applicants. These MS programs appear to play a crucial role as a bridge to PhD studies and are instrumental in enhancing diversity within STEM fields. We suggest that a strategy for success is to provide infrastructure in the form of a coordinated office housing the training grants as a means of structuring mentorship and professional development for under-represented and first generation students."

M.; Mugamba, S.; Ndejjo, R.; Nakigozi, G.",Robert  M. Bulamba,2025-01-06,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundUganda has the highest prevalence and incidence of cervical cancer in the East African region, with 80% of women diagnosed at advanced stage when survival is minimal. Literature on uptake of cervical cancer screening is limited in Uganda and thus womens knowledge and uptake of cervical cancer screening in the general population remains unknown. This study examined this gap of knowledge among women aged 25-65 years, across rural, urban and semi urban communities in a Ugandan district to inform design of targeted future cervical cancer screening programs in the country.

MethodsThis descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in Wakiso district, Uganda in May 2024 among 783 eligible women. Face-to-face interviews were conducted. Uptake of cervical cancer screening (outcome of interest)) was dichotomously (yes/no) assessed. Knowledge of cervical cancer disease was assessed using the AWACAN validated tool, knowledge of cervical cancer screening was assessed using a set of ten (10) questions adapted from previous studies elsewhere, and all were measured on a Likert scale. Univariate, bivariate, and multivariable Poisson regression models with robust variance were performed using Stata software version 17.

ResultsRespondents median age was 31 years (IQR 27-39 years). Majority (89.5%, 701/783) had heard of cervical cancer, and 90.6% (635/701) were aware of screening. Median knowledge score on signs and symptoms, risk factors and cervical cancer screening was 8.0 (IQR= 5-10), 8.0 (IQR= 5-11) and 7.0 (IQR= 4-10) respectively, and 54.3% had high knowledge about cervical cancer screening. Uptake of cervical cancer screening was 33.4%. Living in urban areas (aPR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.05 - 1.88), being the ages 40-49 years (aPR = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.36 - 2.27), 50 years and above (APR = 2.16, 95% CI: 1.53 - 3.04), smoking (aPR = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.05 - 1.86), partner involvement (aPR = 2.61, 95% CI: 2.12-3.21), high knowledge about cervical cancer screening (aPR = 3.29, 95% CI: 2.35-4.60), and living with HIV (aPR = 1.66, 95% CI: 1.66-2.13) were significantly associated with higher uptake of cervical cancer screening among women in this setting.

ConclusionKnowledge of cervical cancer screening was high, but the uptake of cervical cancer screening was lower than the recommended population coverage by WHO and Uganda national guidelines. There is need to improve accessibility to cervical cancer screening, increase nationwide cervical cancer awareness campaigns focusing on high-risk age groups and design targeted, tailored, culturally and socially sensitive interventions for young women aged 25-39 years to improve cervical cancer screening in Uganda."

J.; Gomes, S. M.; Jacob, M. C. M.",Michelle  Cristine Medeiros Jacob,2025-01-06,scientific communication and education,"In this study, we analyzed data from a large sample (n = 778) of individuals who identified as flexitarians, using Brazil as a case study. We applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) to characterize the reasons why individuals self-identify as flexitarians. We explored how these self-perceptions contribute to the construction of a flexitarian identity and identified the challenges this group faces in adopting a flexitarian diet. Our results indicate that there is no homogeneous flexitarian identity, but rather a diversity of categories, organized into five distinct clusters: ethical flexitarians (those who express greater concern for the environment and animals), flexible vegetarians (those who often express the desire to become vegetarian but still consume meat), meat lovers (those who enjoy meat but do not feel compelled to consume it), moderate consumers (those who refrain from meat on certain days of the week), and meat reducers (those who actively reduce their meat consumption). The latter three groups are more similar, as they tend to reduce their meat intake due to the belief that meat is not essential in their diet, although they still enjoy its taste. Additionally, we found that the main challenge faced by our participants is directly related to the social environment, specifically the difficulty in finding alternatives to meat, which makes the love for meats taste and meat-centric eating habits secondary challenges."

The goal of the program was to immerse undergraduate students in conducting global infectious diseases research to train a new generation of scientists to combat future global pandemics. The MHIRT program trained educationally underrepresented groups unique in Hawai`i: Native Hawai`ians and other Pacific Islanders, and underrepresented Asian Americans, e.g., Filipinos and Vietnamese. A 12-member Advisory Committee guided the program development, implementation, recruitment strategies, recruitment, retention, and program evaluation. The program provided an eight-month classroom and field based international research training. Students learned about ""8 steps of research"" and cultural competency, experienced a hands-on research project abroad, and presented their results to the research community in the host country and at UH. Students research topics focused on ongoing projects of UH faculty including those with international collaborations in infectious disease and tropical medicine. Students spent two months on an international research mentors project at an international site under the mentorship of a Hawai`i based research faculty. After eight months, students graduated from the program by presenting their research to family, friends, mentors, and UH faculty and administrators. Trainees in this program pursued academic graduate or professional health degrees. The majority of students pursued further studies related to infectious diseases contributing to workforce development in infectious disease health research. The UH-MHIRT program provides an example of student immersion in international infectious disease research to foster future interest in global health research providing potential benefits for the student and faculty and their research efforts."

M.; Lu, Y.",Yan Lu,2025-01-08,scientific communication and education,"Dark-induced leaf senescence is an extreme example of leaf senescence induced by light deprivation. Prolonged dark treatments of individual leaves result in chlorophyll degradation, macromolecule catabolism, and reduction of photosynthesis. In this work, we described an at-home ""Dark-induced Leaf Senescence"" laboratory exercise for a junior-level undergraduate Plant Physiology course. To perform the dark-induced senescence assay on attached leaves, students may cover individual leaves of an outdoor plant with aluminum foils and record the leaf morphology with controlled vocabularies for [~]9 days. To perform senescence assays on detached leaves, the students may incubate detached leaves in various aqueous solutions (e.g., tap water, sucrose solution, alkali solution, and acid solution) either in the dark or under natural light, and then record the leaf morphology with controlled vocabularies for [~]9 days. This laboratory exercise provides hands-on opportunities for students to understand the relationships among sunlight, chlorophyll, and photosynthesis, in the comfort of students own homes. Specifically, it helps students to comprehend intrinsic and dark-induced leaf senescence mechanisms, the effects of sugars on leaf senescence, and the importance of optimal pH to plant health. This laboratory exercise can be adapted to support inquiry-based learning or be implemented in a middle or high school classroom."

At the same time, many wildlife species survive or even thrive in agricultural landscapes that retain patches of natural ecosystems. This is especially true for tropical oil palm (Elaeis guineensis, Jacq.) plantations that have both replaced tropical forest and other species-rich ecosystems, but as perennial crops can also function as wildlife habitat, especially if fragments of natural ecosystems are retained. There is an urgent need to understand how to manage and monitor wildlife in these fragmented oil palm landscapes. Still, the lack of large, quantitative datasets on species abundance impedes learning. We piloted a novel citizen science-based biodiversity monitoring system in Austindo Nusantara Jayas seven Indonesian oil palm estates, across different biogeographical regions, over a 5-year period. The company-wide monitoring system called PENDAKI, the Indonesian acronym for Care for Biodiversity, is the first of its kind in the palm oil industry. Here we demonstrate that such unstructured and opportunistic data collected mainly by lay people can result in valuable information on temporal and spatial changes in species occupancy. Between September 2019 and June 2024, PENDAKI has resulted in 148,286 wildlife observations, that included 699 reliably identified faunal and 186 floral species, with contributions from 3,950 employee contributors. We estimate species-specific occupancy rates using Bayesian occupancy modeling, ideally suited for opportunistic data where survey effort is unknown. We show that these occupancy data can reliably show temporal and spatial changes in the distribution of iconic wildlife such as orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus). We combined data from reliably identified species with at least 50 records to create the ""Living Plantation Index"", an estate-specific annual index of wildlife diversity based on occupancy estimates. We conclude that citizen science-based biodiversity monitoring works remarkably well in oil palm plantations because of the large number of people typically working there. In the process we discovered the emergence of co-benefits such as increasing environmental stewardship awareness across the workforce, raising the profile of the conservation department within the company. We also noted the benefits in terms of suitable data to meet regulatory and voluntary disclosure requirements."

Inclusive transformation critically depends on recognition of the plural values of nature in society. Lack of value alignment can lead to profound disagreements with those in society not sharing the same views on nature.
C_LIO_LITo explore plural value perspectives, we introduce the Value Perspectives of Nature (VPN) scale. This scale builds on existing value literature and measurement scales as well as on transformative approaches, most notable the Nature Futures Framework.
C_LIO_LIUsing a seven-step process that includes qualitative expert evaluations, cognitive interviews, and three rounds of quantitative pre-testing and validation, the scale is developed, refined, and validated across five European countries (representative sample; N=1000).
C_LIO_LIThe final VPN scale consists of 11 items, measuring instrumental value perspectives (material and nonmaterial contributions to people), relational value perspectives (place attachment and identity; Fulfilment and well-being; Spirituality; and Kinship) and intrinsic value perspectives (nature as an end in itself and acknowledgement of the rights of nature). The final validation study shows moderate to high internal consistency, reliability, and predictive validity of the scale across all countries.
C_LIO_LIWhile existing scales often focus on single values, the VPN is the first cross-culturally validated scale that integrates intrinsic, instrumental, and relational value perspectives into one composite scale with a focus on changes for the future. Based on the development and analysis of the VPN, we discuss several theoretical and conceptual issues in relation to relational values.
C_LIO_LIPolicy implications: The VPN scale can be used in survey research to understand attitudes towards nature restoration measures. This may facilitate dialogue on effective and just transformative change in nature, through sensitising to the plural values of diverse communities. It may also be used to monitor the diversity of value perspectives over time and between communities and stakeholders. Understanding such changes in mind-sets and taking into account concerns from critical groups in society will help navigate towards positive nature futures supported by the general public.

O.",Samuel O Adeosun,2025-01-20,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundPublication count is the currency in academia, but the most widely used whole count method is considered unfair and inflationary. Several non-inflationary author credit-allocation schemas (NIACAS) have been proposed, but none is widely adopted in practice (e.g., in evaluating faculty scholarly productivity) or in bibliometric research. This low adoption and implementation rate may be due to the complexity in operationalizing the schemas.

AimTo develop an application that automates the calculation of individual authors scholarly output metrics based on multiple NIACAS.

MethodPublished formulas of NIACAS were written as Python functions wrapped in a Streamlit user interface that takes .csv files of the relevant corpus, and a list of authors Scopus IDs as inputs. The functions calculate the authors output metrics based on NIACAS including first- and last-author straight counts, arithmetic, golden share, and multiple variations of fractional, geometric, and harmonic schemas. Collaboration metrics are also calculated. Secondary features include modelers for author counts and schemas. In a use-case, absolute rank displacement (ARD) and actual contribution proportions (ACP) were compared between highly cited clinical medicine researchers and high h-index pharmacy practice faculty populations.

ResultsAuthormetriX accurately calculates individual authors aggregate scholarly output based on 14 NIACAS, from the file inputs. There were schema and population differences in ACP, but only schema differences in ARD within the populations studied.

ConclusionsAuthormetriX simplifies the implementation of non-inflationary author credit-allocation schemas and will facilitate their broader adoption in practice and bibliometric research. AuthormetriX is freely available at https://sadeosun-a-uthormetrix-v1.streamlit.app/."

However, the relative importance of each of these social supports in affecting students motivation, and the precise processes through which these social factors motivate students, are not well understood at the college level. The present study examined how family, peers, mentors, and professors shaped science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) college students motivational beliefs for career decision making, defining motivational beliefs in accordance with situated expectancy-value theory. We collected survey and open-ended responses from a large sample of college students (n = 2,229) in 42 unique STEM courses at a large, public southeastern university in the United States. We examined how, why, and for whom different social supports influenced students task-value and/or competence related motivational beliefs for career-decision making. Results indicated that students most often selected interactions with family members as influencing their career decision-making, both in terms of overall influences and as the strongest influence, relative to interactions with peers, mentors, or professors. For all social influences, most students reported being attracted in a positive way towards certain careers as a result of social interactions, as opposed to socializers making students disenchanted with careers. Most students described how social supports influenced motivational beliefs related to task values, with comparatively fewer referencing social influences on competence-related beliefs. Findings highlight the important role of multiple social supports, particularly family, in shaping students motivational beliefs and career decision-making throughout emerging adulthood.

Educational Impact and Implications StatementPreparing a qualified and diverse STEM workforce requires a robust understanding of the factors that influence college students motivational beliefs and decisions about their career paths. We examined how, why, and for whom support from family, peers, mentors, and professors impacted STEM college students career motivation and decision making, using both qualitative and quantitative data. Results suggest that family plays a particularly crucial role in shaping college students career motivation, especially by helping them see the positive value of particular career paths.

Overall, students who received coaching and help from scientists made the most positive comments, consistent with our finding that students who received these kinds of help achieved better SEF outcomes. Students who participated in school-only level SEFs made the most negative comments. Reasons students gave why SEF participation increased their interest in S&E aligned with mastery criteria. By contrast, reasons students gave in a previous study regarding why competitive SEFs should be required aligned with performance criteria. Mastery and performance orientations (learning vs. winning) integrate differently with the three elements of self-determination theory: motivation, competence and community engagement. Recognizing these differences in relation to science fair requirements and the S&E career interests of students who participate in SEFs has the potential to enhance the impact of SEF participation on student STEM interest and knowledge."

S.",Katelyn M Cooper,2025-01-27,scientific communication and education,"While scientific environments have been described as unwelcoming to the LGBTQ+ community, and fields such as physics have systematically documented these challenges, the climate in biology workplaces has not been assessed. We conducted the largest survey to date of LGBTQ+ biologists to examine how their sense of belonging and perception of climate in the biology workplace and professional societies compare to that of their straight and cis peers. We surveyed 1419 biologists across five professional societies, with 486 identifying as LGBTQ+. Trans and gender non-conforming (TGNC) biologists reported lower belonging and morale within the workplace, professional societies, and the biology community compared to cis, straight biologists. They also reported being less comfortable with the climate of various professional biology environments. While LGBTQ+ biologists report that their workplaces are moderately inclusive, over 20% of all LGBTQ+ biologists and nearly 40% of TGNC biologists experience exclusionary behavior at work. This landmark survey provides the first comprehensive analysis of the LGBTQ+ climate in biology, revealing specific challenges faced by TGNC scientists and identifying interventions to enhance inclusivity for scientists.

Significance StatementThis landmark study includes the largest known sample of LGBTQ+ biologists and offers the first comprehensive description of the LGBTQ+ climate in biology, differentiating between the experiences of cisgender lesbian, gay, bisexual, and queer (LGBQ) biologists and transgender and gender non-conforming (TGNC) biologists. The study found that compared to non-LGBTQ+ biologists, TGNC participants report lower belonging, morale and comfort with the climate across biology workplaces, professional societies, and the biology community. While on average LGBTQ+ participants reported that their workplaces are moderately inclusive, over 20% of all LGBTQ+ biologists and nearly 40% of TGNC biologists report experiencing exclusionary behaviors at work. The study offers immediate implications for institutional policies and professional development in the biological sciences."

F.; Reif, D. M.; Schymanski, E. L.; Rager, J. R.; Baker, E.",Erin Baker,2025-01-28,scientific communication and education,"Over the last decade, global contamination from per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has become apparent due to their detection in countless matrices worldwide, from consumer products to human blood to drinking water. As researchers implement non-targeted analyses (NTA) to more fully understand the PFAS present in the environment and human bodies, clear guidance is needed for consistent and objective reporting of the identified molecules. Confidence levels for small molecules analyzed and identified with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) have existed since 2014; however, unification of currently-used levels and improved guidance for their application is needed due to inconsistencies in reporting and continuing innovations in analytical methods. Here, we (i) investigate current practices for confidence level reporting of PFAS identified with liquid chromatography (LC), gas chromatography (GC), and/or ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) coupled with HRMS and (ii) propose a simple, unified confidence level guidance that incorporates both PFAS-specific attributes and IMS collision cross section (CCS) values.

SynopsisUnified and simplified requirements to guide confidence level assignment in non-targeted PFAS identification efforts with ion mobility spectrometry.

10.1101/2025.01.31.635792,Public Funding for AI in Canada 2011-2022: An equity-focused environmental scan,"Attema, G.; Mertz, M.; Anawati, A.; Austin, A.; Bertrand, J.; Jewett, R.; Cameron, E.",Ghislaine Attema,2025-02-04,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundIn this new equity-driven landscape, if there is to be system-wide transformation in research funding allocation, indicators of funding allocations need to be explored. This environmental scan aims to understand how research funding for artificial intelligence (AI) has been allocated and distributed in Canada from 2011-2022. Using geographical representations, we describe and map research funding for Canadian researchers by publicly funded granting agencies and provide analyses for AI research spending since 2011

MethodologyWe developed a rapid environmental scan to create a database of all AI funded projects from the following agencies: CIHR, NSERC, SSHRC, CRC, AMS, NFRF and CFI. Using publicly available research funding reporting and agency websites, we identified through title, keyword and project summary screening, AI projects in English and French for the years 2011-2022.

Principal FindingsA total of 4112 projects were identified, with the following information for each project recorded: title, year, institution, city, province, total funding, language, funding agency, funding program and primary investigator. A total of $384,933,265.74 million was allocated for publicly funded AI related projects in Canada from 2011-2022. Average funding per project was $93,612.18. The top three provinces with the most funding for all years are Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia. The top three funding agencies by total amount for all years were NSERC at $155,267,817, CIHR at $136,594,644, and CFI at $58,317,627

ConclusionThis information can assist in accountability and understanding of Canadas publicly funded research allocations, and provide information related to the distribution of such funds, thus informing equity policy strategies."

The aim of this study was to investigate whether different surfaces underneath a force plate would elicit differences in derived force plate variables using a mechanical testing device. A mechanical testing device was used to assess force reduction, peak force, rate of force development (RFD) and contact time across seven common testing surfaces: vinyl, rubber, Olympic lifting platform, ground (CarpetF) and first floor (CarpetF) carpet, Mondo track and a sprung gymnasium floor (Sprung). Significant differences in force reduction, peak force, RFD, and contact time were found between flooring conditions (p < 0.05), with large to extremely large effect sizes. Sprung flooring exhibited the highest force reduction and lowest peak forces, while CarpetF demonstrated the lowest RFD and longest contact time. These findings highlight the flooring surface underneath the force plate during testing significantly influenced derived variables. Practitioners should exert caution and consideration to force plate testing location and advocate standardisation in flooring surface in order to ensure consistent and accurate results."

Fifty articles involving experiments necessitating the agreement of an ethics committee were searched in each of the three journals to June 30th 2023. Because PNAs announced that a Statistical Review Committee was created and working since September 2023, a further set of 50 articles was retrieved and analyzed from 2024 January 1st. The following items were checked in articles: an explicit statement of approval from an animal ethics committee, the calculation of the appropriate samples size needed and how randomization and blinding were performed, the minimum sample size reported, the presence of repeats, and the methods used to limit type I and type II errors.

No clear experimental design was fully reported in any article. The major problems were 1) extremely small sample sizes (<4/group) in nearly half of the articles, 2) confusion between biological repeats and technical replications, and 3) lack of correction for multiple comparisons. These errors led to major inflation of type I and type II errors.

In conclusion, only 10 percent of the articles analyzed presented correct statistical methodology."

P.; Nwakaeze, E. A.; Aniekwe, C. W.; Onu, E. N.; Adikwu, M. U.; Eze, P. M.",Chika P. Ejikeugwu,2025-02-10,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundThe irrational use of antibiotics in poultry production has far-reaching consequences and continues to impact the fight against antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Africa. In Nigeria, antibiotics are available over-the-counter and are widely used in food animal production for various reasons, including prophylaxis and growth promotion. While this practice may support animal production, it also drives the spread of AMR, posing serious health challenges due to close human-livestock interactions and the countrys high disease burden. This study examined poultry farmers knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding antibiotic use and AMR, aiming to highlight the public health risks and challenges in combating AMR in Nigeria.

MethodsA cross-sectional survey of 200 poultry farms in Enugu State, Southeast Nigeria, was conducted to evaluate farmers KAP towards antibiotic usage and AMR. Using a validated, standardized, and self-administered questionnaire, data were collected from farmers responsible for key farm decisions, including input and feed management. The questionnaire comprised three sections: socio-demographic data, knowledge of AMR, and knowledge and practices regarding antibiotic use. Ethical approval was obtained, and participants gave oral consent based on their professional capacity.

ResultsThe evaluation of poultrys farmers KAP regarding antibiotic usage and AMR revealed that the majority of farmers (90.5%) reported using antibiotics, primarily for treating infections (80.5%) or for feed enhancement, growth promotion, and prophylaxis (61%). Ampicillin (75%), ciprofloxacin (71.5%), and doxycycline (71%) were the most commonly administered antibiotics. Monthly administration was the most common (48%), and 89% of respondents believed that antibiotics promote poultry growth. Interestingly, a substantial proportion of respondents (65%) were unaware of AMR, highlighting a significant knowledge gap, with only 16% recognizing the risk of AMR infections.

ConclusionOur study revealed that the surveyed poultry farmers heavily rely on antibiotics, primarily for treating infections and, to a significant extent, for growth promotion, despite their limited awareness of AMR. Ampicillin was identified as the most commonly used antibiotic, raising concerns due to its potential link to beta-lactamase selection amid the countrys carbapenem resistance issues. These findings underscore the urgent need for targeted education to address the AMR knowledge gap and reduce the misuse of antibiotics in poultry farming settings in Nigeria."

Despite the existing perception that commercial motives promote cutting-edge innovation, concerns may arise about their risk of limiting scientific exploration from diverse perspectives, which nurtures long-term innovative potential. Here, we investigate the interplay between scientific exploration and industrial influence by analyzing about 20 million papers and US, Chinese, and European patents in genetic research, a domain of far-reaching societal importance. We observe that research on new genes has declined since the early 2000s, but the exploration of novel gene combinations still underpins biotechnology innovation. Fields of highly practical or commercial focus are less likely to adopt the innovative approaches, exhibiting lower research vitality. Additionally, continuous scientific research creates exploratory opportunities for innovation, while industrys R&D efforts are typically short-lived. Alarmingly, up to 42.2-74.4% of these exploratory opportunities could be lost if scientific research is restrained by industry interests, highlighting the cost of over-reliance on commercially-driven research. Given the industrys dominance in recent technologies, our work calls for a balanced approach with long-term scientific exploration to preserve innovation vitality, unlock the full potential of genetic research and biotechnology, and address complex global challenges."

W.",Robin W Spencer,2025-02-24,scientific communication and education,"Mutations occur throughout the 16,569 basepair human mitochondrial genome and most are under strong purifying selection. Archaeologically and genealogically useful mutations, in contrast, are neutral and remain stable for centuries. In new results, multiple lines of evidence show that the latter appear on average every 2900 years and the effective genealogical chromosome is limited to about 4800 basepairs, 28% of its physical length. These mutations are already three-fold oversampled in the haplotree; all those in protein-coding genes are translationally synonymous. This evidence offers a limited prospect that additional testing can significantly increase the branching or temporal resolution of the haplotree."

A.",Miriam A. Hickey,2025-02-28,scientific communication and education,"The global decline in the number of physician-scientists, despite an increase in practicing physicians, underscores a critical need for integrating research training into medical education. Addressing this issue, we established an international research exchange program between the University of Tartu (UT) and the University of Iceland (UI). This initiative aimed to enhance scientific literacy, foster transferable skills, and align curricula with European standards through collaborative research experiences.

The program enabled reciprocal student mobility, involving 11 medical undergraduates (6 from UT, 5 from UI), who conducted month-long basic science research projects. Participants completed comprehensive pre-training in scientific communication, safety protocols, and ethics before earning 6 ECTS credits for fulfilling laboratory requirements and submitting final reports. Students were also required to participate in local public engagement events. Despite challenges and delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the program met its objectives, demonstrating adaptability and effective resource management.

Key outcomes included the development of an online learning platform, and multilingual guidelines and validated survey instruments to evaluate program impact, which we provide here to support similar initiatives. Feedback from pre-, post-, and post-1-year questionnaires revealed significant improvements in participants confidence in research methodologies, critical appraisal of scientific literature, and motivation for future research involvement.

This project highlights the potential of structured international exchange programs to address gaps in medical education, enhance scientific training, and cultivate the next generation of physician-scientists."

K.; Newman, D. L.",Dina L. Newman,2025-03-02,scientific communication and education,"Visual representations in molecular biology tend to follow a set of shared conventions for using certain shapes and symbols to convey information about the size and structure of nucleotides, genes, and chromosomes. Understanding how and why biologists use these conventions to represent DNA is a key part of visual literacy in molecular biology. Visual literacy, which is the ability to read and interpret visual representations, encompasses a set of skills that are necessary for biologists to effectively use models to communicate about molecular structures that cannot be directly observed. To gauge students visual literacy skills, we conducted semi-structured interviews with undergraduate students who had completed at least a year of biology courses. We asked students to draw and interpret figures of nucleotides, genes, and chromosomes, and we analyzed their drawings for adherence to conventions for representing scale and abstraction. We found that 77% of students made errors in representing scale and 86% of students made errors in representing abstraction. We also observed about half of the students in our sample using the conventional shapes and symbols to represent DNA in unconventional ways. These unconventional sketches may signal an incomplete understanding of the structure and function of DNA. Our findings indicate that students may need additional instructional support to interpret the conventions in common representations of DNA. We highlight opportunities for instructors to scaffold visual literacy skills into their teaching to help students better understand visual conventions for representing scale and abstraction in molecular biology."

V.",Emily R. Trunnell,2025-03-02,scientific communication and education,"Despite increased enthusiasm for research methods that can replace the use of animals, the numbers of animals used in science and the funding for animal-based projects remain high. Our work addresses whether a possible ""animal methods bias,"" a preference for or greater familiarity with animal-based methods, in the grant review process may be contributing to this problem. In a novel pilot study to assess the possibility of animal methods bias in the National Institutes of Healths (NIHs) funding of basic, translational, and preclinical neuroscience research, we used the NIHs iCite and RePORTER tools to characterize the expertise of members of 23 non-clinical NIH study sections and the methods used in successful grants scored by these review groups, based on publicly available data. Our data suggest that study sections assessing grants for basic, translational, and preclinical neuroscience research are largely composed of reviewers whose primary expertise is in animal-based methods. Animal use among reviewers positively correlated with the number of animal-based grants funded and negatively correlated with funding of non-animal research methods. Recommendations for further study and for avoiding or mitigating animal methods bias in grant review are provided."

H.; Kishore, A.; Das, J.",Jishnu Das,2025-03-07,scientific communication and education,"An exponential growth in the scientific literature necessitates the development of highly scalable computational tools that can effectively analyze and distill insights from complex, interconnected research landscapes. We introduce Distributed, Interpretable, and Scalable computing for Co-authorship Networks (DISCo-Net), a robust and scalable tool engineered to curate and examine large-scale co-authorship networks by harnessing the power of distributed computing and advanced relational database queries. We use DISCo-Net to analyze co-authorship networks derived from millions of papers in the life sciences and physical sciences over more than two decades. Using a range of deep learning approaches, we surprisingly found that pre-trained zero-shot embeddings from a sentence transformer better captured global co-authorship relationships than a complex graphical attention transformer. Even more surprisingly, a simple interpretable Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) model performed as well as the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model. Through topic modeling on TF-IDF document descriptors, we identified nine major research areas prevalent globally over the past 24 years and captured topic-specific shifting trends in scientific output. Our study draws an innovative parallel between collaborative research networks and genomic regulatory structures, applying genomics data analysis methodologies to uncover patterns in global scientific collaboration. This approach reveals interpretable alignments between research interests and human developmental stages, while also identifying emerging influential players in the global research landscape. The findings highlight potential far-reaching consequences of current funding challenges, particularly in the U.S., and offer actionable insights for optimizing resource allocation and fostering innovation in an interconnected global scientific community."

F.; Loya, A. K.",Emily J. Hangen,2025-03-17,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundTo address documented demographic disparities in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) disciplines, targeted interventions have been designed to close achievement gaps and remedy the ""leaky STEM pipeline"". However, much less work has focused on designing complementary interventions that to seek to broaden the population of youth who ""enter the pipeline"" or who are exposed to STEM and interest is stoked from the onset. The current work seeks to broaden STEM engagement in youth by developing a STEM intervention using unrecognized forms of cultural capital. Rather than situating STEM learning within traditional ""STEM-Intensive"" programs that require a pre-existing level of STEM interest, the current work developed and tested interventions designed to broaden engagement of youth with pre-existing interest in sports. These basketball-based STEM education interventions utilized sports as a venue for informal STEM learning. The current work tested 3 variations of this novel STEM education intervention: a single hour event, a one-day clinic, and a multi-day camp. Each of these programs was delivered to naturally-occurring, targeted populations of students with high levels of pre-existing sport engagement and low levels of STEM engagement. The sample populations included students from 2nd grade to 12th grade, with middle school students being the most heavily represented.

ResultsInterest in pursuing a STEM career significantly increased across all 3 variations of the basketball-based STEM education intervention. Notably, these effect sizes were descriptively larger for programs of longer duration (e.g. multi-day camp vs. one hour event) and were significantly stronger for students who reported playing basketball prior to the program.

ConclusionsThe current work introduces a novel STEM education intervention that utilizes students pre-existing interest (e.g. basketball) as a bridge to STEM engagement. This approach was shown to be repeatedly successful in enhancing participants STEM career interest, especially for participants from underserved communities with high levels of sport interest."

Using PubMedBERT, we transformed abstracts into 768-dimensional embeddings that capture the nuanced thematic structure of the field. Dimensionality reduction with t-SNE revealed distinct clusters corresponding to key domains such as analytical chemistry, plant biology, pharmacology, and clinical diagnostics. In addition, a neural topic modeling pipeline refined with GPT-4o mini reclassified the corpus into 20 distinct topics--ranging from ""Plant Stress Response Mechanisms"" and ""NMR Spectroscopy Innovations"" to ""COVID-19 Metabolomic and Immune Responses."" Temporal analyses further highlight trends including the rise of deep learning methods post-2015 and a continued focus on biomarker discovery. Integration of metadata such as publication statistics and sample sizes provide additional context to these evolving research dynamics. An interactive web application (https://metascape.streamlit.app/) enables dynamic exploration of these insights. Overall, this study offers a robust framework for literature synthesis that empowers researchers, clinicians, and policymakers to identify emerging research trajectories and address critical challenges in metabolomics, while also sharing our perspectives on key trends shaping the field."

A.",Natasha A Karp,2025-03-19,scientific communication and education,"For over thirty years, research has highlighted a sex bias in early research, risking the validity of biological knowledge. The first step towards change is effectively challenging misconceptions allowing researchers to perceive sex inclusive research as do-able. Utilising the theory of planned behaviour, we quantified researchers intention as a proxy measure for conducting sex inclusive research and explored attitude (value of the behaviour), subjective norm (perceived social pressure) and behavioural control (ability to conduct the behaviour). Additionally, we quantified the knowledge gap, prevalence of misconceptions, and assessed perceived benefits and barriers. We tested a workshop intervention that directly challenges the cultural embedded barriers. The data shows researchers intentions were high, but they had weak statistical knowledge and misunderstandings leading to a perception that inclusive research is prohibitive due to cost and animal use. We demonstrate that participation in the training intervention improved knowledge, altered the perceived barriers and cultural expectations."

This study tests the feasibility of the Fast & Fair peer review initiative by evaluating whether we could implement and adhere to a structured timeline for rapid peer review at Biology Open. A 6-month pilot conducted from July to December 2024 evaluated a structured workflow with pre-contracted reviewers under two payment models: a freelance model or a retainer model. All manuscripts assigned to two of the journals ten academic editors were included in the Fast & Fair peer review initiative experiment. A structured editorial time-line ensured that all manuscripts received reviews and first decisions within 7 business days. The results demonstrated that 100% of Fast & Fair peer review initiative manuscripts met the turnaround target, with a mean of 4.6 business days (n=20 manuscripts). Review quality was maintained, as indicated by assessments by academic editors. The freelancer model outperformed retainers in cost-effectiveness. These findings suggest that the Fast & Fair peer review initiative is feasible and does not compromise review quality. While scalability remains to be tested, the initiative eliminates a major bottleneck in traditional peer review by streamlining reviewer identification and enforcing a strict editorial timeline."

However, there is very little published research on the availability and impact of opportunities for community college students, particularly those provided by Department of Energy (DOE) national laboratories. To address this gap, we collected data from students who participated in two DOE sponsored programs spanning from 2009 to 2016: the Community College Internship (CCI) and Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internship (SULI) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). Among CCI alumni, 90% earned a STEM bachelors degree and 88% are on a STEM career pathway. For SULI alumni, 91% earned a STEM bachelors degree and 71% are on a STEM career pathway. Overall, 80% of CCI alumni and 56% of SULI alumni have entered the STEM workforce, 5% of CCI alumni and 11% of SULI alumni are in the health workforce, and 6% of CCI alumni and 13% of SULI alumni are in the non-STEM workforce. Our findings indicate that community college students who participate in STEM professional development activities (such as the CCI program) are likely to complete their academic degrees and pursue STEM careers at rates comparable to those of university students. This investment in providing internships at LBNL for community college students has effectively supported their entry into STEM careers and their desire in pursuing work within the DOE complex in the years following their participation in these programs."

While traditional pre-college science classrooms and research programs offer various outlets for scientific communication through lab reports and presentations, access to publication, in particular, remains largely out of reach for these students. Yet, this landscape is beginning to shift as an emerging cohort of young researchers challenge this barrier and choose to extend their research experiences by publishing their work in peer-reviewed journals specifically for pre-college students. Given the rigorous nature of scientific publication, our study investigates why pre-college students voluntarily undertake this challenge, revealing important insights about student motivation and identity development in science. Through analysis of survey responses from student authors using the lens of science identity theory, we discovered that students view publication not merely to share results, but as a transformative process that validates their role in the scientific community. Female students in particular emphasized publication as a pathway to gain recognition as scientists and develop professional writing skills. These findings challenge traditional assumptions about pre-college science communication. They suggest that access to authentic publication opportunities through outreach programs may be a powerful, yet underutilized tool for fostering science identity and expanding participation in STEM fields. Our research provides critical insights for educators and policymakers seeking to create more inclusive and empowering pathways into science careers."

Biomedical research in Brazil expanded rapidly over the last three decades, with no systematic assessment of the replicability of its findings. With this in mind, we set up the Brazilian Reproducibility Initiative, a multicenter replication of published experiments from Brazilian science using three common experimental methods: the MTT assay, the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and the elevated plus maze (EPM). A total of 56 laboratories performed 143 replications of 56 experiments; of these, 97 replications of 47 experiments were considered valid by an independent committee. Replication rates for these experiments varied between 15 and 45% according to five predefined criteria. In median terms, relative effects (expressed as ratios between group means) were 60% larger in original experiments than in replications, while coefficients of variation were 60% smaller. Effect size decrease was smaller for MTT, cell line experiments and original results with less variability, while t values for replications were positively correlated with researcher predictions about replicability. Deviations from preregistered protocols were very common in replications, most frequently due to reasons inherent to the experimental model or related to infrastructure and logistics. Our results highlight factors that limit the replicability of results published by researchers in Brazil and suggest ways by which this scenario can be improved."

As human activities and shifting climate patterns induce changes in the environment that alter habitat and range of reservoir species, the potential for human and animal interactions will increase and enhance the opportunity for spillover. Thus, any emergency response preparedness planning must take into account the function and coordination of agencies across the sectors of human, animal and environmental health. Within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania a table-top exercise was performed to evaluate a multi-agency response during a hypothetical zoonotic disease investigation. The exercise was evaluated by the participants to gain feedback on the overall process and lessons learned. Here, we describe the tabletop exercise scenario and the insights gained. We found that differences in operational structure create challenges for interdepartmental communication and in the ability to resource a coordinated response, highlighting opportunities to develop infrastructure that will facilitate future actions.

However, the intensification of fish farming raises concerns about antimicrobial use (AMU) and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). This study assessed the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of fish farmers regarding AMU and AMR across 25 districts in Zambias ten provinces. Data were collected from fish farmers using a structured questionnaire distributed via district fisheries officers and analyzed through descriptive and inferential statistics, including logistic regression.

The results revealed significant gaps in knowledge, with only 17.4% of farmers classified as knowledgeable about AMU and AMR. Attitude assessments showed that 60.5% exhibited positive attitudes toward responsible AMU practices, while the remaining 39.5% displayed negative perceptions. In terms of practices, 76.5% adhered to good practices, including consulting veterinary professionals and responsible antibiotic use, whereas 23.5% engaged in poor practices. Key factors influencing KAP outcomes included age, farming experience, and annual production capacity. Farmers aged 30-39 years and those with 1-5 years of experience demonstrated significantly more positive attitudes (p < 0.05), while those with higher production capacities (501-1000 kg) exhibited better practices (p < 0.001).

The findings highlight critical knowledge gaps and inconsistent practices regarding AMU and AMR among Zambian fish farmers. Targeted interventions, including education programs, enhanced access to veterinary services, and strengthened regulatory frameworks, are essential to promote responsible AMU, mitigate AMR risks, and ensure the sustainability of aquaculture in Zambia."

This study explores the intricate relationship between ocean literacy and pro-environmental behaviors, emphasizing the roles of emotional connections, cultural significance, and educational experiences. By examining the multidimensional aspects of ocean literacy, the research seeks to identify key factors that influence conservation actions and the practical application of marine knowledge.

MethodsUtilizing qualitative methodologies, this study conducted semi-structured interviews with 16 Chinese university students to delve into their perceptions and interactions with the marine environment. The interviews explored various dimensions such as oceanic knowledge, environmental beliefs, value orientations, and actions related to marine conservation. NVivo software was used for data analysis, allowing for the identification of key themes through a rigorous coding process. The studys analysis also included a moderated mediation model to examine how educational experiences influence the relationship between ocean literacy and conservation behaviors.

ResultsThe findings reveal that ocean literacy among university students comprises key components such as scientific knowledge, environmental ethics, conservation action, policy understanding, and critical thinking. Significant gaps in marine knowledge were observed, alongside strong emotional and cultural connections to the ocean, which significantly mediate the relationship between ocean literacy and conservation behaviors. Educational experiences further moderated these effects, highlighting the need for enhanced marine education.

ConclusionThis study underscores the necessity of integrating comprehensive educational strategies with emotional and cultural engagement to effectively promote marine conservation behaviors. The results advocate for educational reforms that incorporate practical and interactive learning approaches, aimed at deepening students understanding and involvement in marine conservation. Strengthening these educational frameworks can significantly enhance ocean literacy and foster proactive environmental stewardship among university students."

A.",Michael A Pascoe,2025-04-21,scientific communication and education,"PurposeTeaching can enhance the teachers learning through retrieval practice, elaboration, and metacognitive engagement. In anatomy education, near-peer teaching roles such as laboratory teaching assistants (TAs) may therefore benefit not only learners but also the instructors. This study investigated whether serving as an anatomy TA is associated with improved performance on the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1. It was hypothesized that medical students who taught anatomy would demonstrate higher Step 1 scores due to the cognitive benefits of teaching.

MethodsSixty second-year medical students were identified who served as anatomy TAs in a donor-based physical therapy course over seven academic years. Each was matched to a peer from the same graduating class with similar anatomy course performance but no TA experience. De-identified Step 1 scores were obtained from institutional records. An independent samples t-test compared Step 1 scores between groups.

ResultsThe mean Step 1 score was 238.0 (SD = 19.7) for TAs and 236.1 (SD = 16.5) for matched controls. This difference was not statistically significant (t(118) = 0.573, p = 0.568).

ConclusionsMedical students who served as anatomy TAs did not perform significantly better on the USMLE Step 1 than their peers. These findings suggest that, under the conditions of this study, participation in a near-peer teaching role did not translate into measurable gains on standardized testing. Educators should consider that while teaching may support professional development and anatomical understanding, additional instructional design elements may be needed to align these experiences with exam-related learning outcomes."

A.",Michael A Pascoe,2025-04-21,scientific communication and education,"Wikipedia is one of the most widely accessed sources of scientific information globally, serving as a critical platform for public understanding and engagement with science. Despite its influence, many scientific societies are underrepresented or insufficiently described on the platform, limiting their visibility, outreach potential, and opportunities for public scholarship. This gap is particularly significant given Wikipedias high placement in search engine results and its role in shaping perceptions of scientific institutions. To address this issue, a structured case study was conducted focusing on the Wikipedia article for the American Association for Anatomy (AAA). A baseline evaluation revealed major deficiencies in article structure, historical coverage, citation quality, and alignment with Wikipedias editorial standards. Using a methodical editing process informed by science communication principles and content guidelines, the article was substantially revised. High-quality secondary sources were used to develop new sections on AAAs mission, governance, publications, awards, meetings, and outreach efforts. Following these edits, the articles classification improved from Stub to Start-class, its visibility and connectivity within Wikipedia increased, and the number of internal and external references, links, and structural elements grew substantially. This outcome demonstrates that scholarly engagement with Wikipedia can meaningfully enhance institutional presence and public accessibility of scientific knowledge. This case study offers a transparent and replicable model for scientific organizations and educators seeking to improve digital visibility and contribute to open-access science. It also highlights the potential for Wikipedia editing to serve as a form of public scholarship and a high-impact educational practice within the anatomical sciences."

Here we highlight the environmental impact of this failure to self-correct sufficiently rapidly. We identified a non-fraudulent occurrence of irreproducible findings: the literature on the association between genetic variation in the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) with anxiety and depression. An initial report in 1996 found evidence for an association, but a study as early as 2005 that was three orders of magnitude larger found no evidence for an association. However, studies investigating this association continue to be published. We isolated 1,183 studies published between 1996 and 2024 that investigated the association and calculated an estimated carbon footprint of these studies. We estimate that the failure to self-correct had a footprint of approximately 30,068 tons of CO2 equivalent. Our aim is to present a case study of the potential carbon footprint of research activity that is no longer justified, when a theory is disproven. We highlight the importance of integrating self-correction mechanisms within research, and embracing the need to discontinue unfruitful lines of enquiry."

G.; Ayalew, S. M.; Assefa, S. K.",Simachew Getaneh Endalamew,2025-04-24,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundFasciolosis is a parasitic disease caused by liver flukes of the genus Fasciola, predominantly Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica. This zoonotic disease significantly impacts both livestock and human populations, particularly in areas with extensive agriculture and poor sanitation. Ethiopia, one of the Africas leading ovine and caprine producers, is highly affected by fasciolosis. However, despite its economic and public health importance, there is a lack of comprehensive up-to-date evidence on prevalence and risk factors of small ruminant fasciolosis. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aims to explore the pooled prevalence of fasciolosis among small ruminants (ovine and caprine) in Ethiopia.

MethodsThis systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A comprehensive systematic review was performed across five electronic databases (Google Scholar, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect), with all database searches and registers inquiries finalized on November 26, 2024. A random-effect model was used to determine the pooled prevalence of fasciolosis in ovine and caprine. Heterogeneity was assessed, and the source of variation was analyzed using subgroup and sensitivity analysis. Publication bias assessment and meta-regression analysis were also performed to ensure the robustness of the review. Funnel plots and Eggers asymmetry tests were used to investigate publication bias.

ResultsOverall, 33 studies were included in the meta-analysis, and the pooled prevalence of fasciolosis in ovine and caprine was 32.25% (95% CI: 25.97-38.86%). This study revealed substantial between-study heterogeneity (inconsistency index (I2)) = 97.3%, p < 0.0001). Among the variables analyzed for heterogeneity, species, publication years, season of data collection, and regions of the study were the most significant predictors of heterogeneity The sub-group analysis showed that the prevalence of fasciolosis among ovine and caprine was 37.18% (95% CI; 31.06-43.51%) and 12.76% (95% CI; 4.06-25.19%), respectively. According to the region-based subgroup meta-analysis, studies taken from Amhara region had the highest prevalence of fasciolosis among small ruminants (43.99% (95% CI: 31.83-56.52%)).

ConclusionThis systematic review and meta-analysis emphasize fasciolosis as a pervasive threat to Ethiopian small ruminants. Policymakers, healthcare providers, and communities should collaborate to integrate robust prevention mechanisms for the disease, establishing standardized protocols for Fasciola monitoring, reporting, and mitigation."

Emerging evidence suggests inflammation plays a pivotal role in AF initiation, maintenance, and outcomes.

MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional case-control study to assess whether, among patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) and permanent AF, serum inflammatory cytokines, metabolic parameters, epigenetic factors, and echocardiographic markers of structural remodeling are interrelated. Eighty-two consecutive CHF patients with permanent AF and 82 CHF patients with sinus rhythm and no AF history were enrolled from the Internal Medicine and Stroke Care Unit at ""P. Giaccone"" Hospital, Palermo, between January 2020 and May 2022.

ResultsAF patients were older and exhibited higher left atrial volume index (LAVI), reduced left atrial (LA) strain, increased relative wall thickness (RWT), and lower ejection fraction (EF%). Renal markers, including estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and microalbuminuria, were significantly different. Inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 8 (IL-8), and NT-proBNP were elevated in the AF group. Multivariable logistic regression identified LAVI, LA strain, microalbuminuria, albumin/creatinine ratio (ACr), and protein/creatinine ratio (PCr) as independent predictors of AF. Correlation analyses demonstrated strong associations between echocardiographic, inflammatory, and renal parameters. No significant differences in circulating miRNAs were observed.

ConclusionsThese findings highlight the intricate interconnection between atrial remodeling, renal dysfunction, and systemic inflammation in AF pathogenesis. A better understanding of these mechanisms may inform future risk stratification strategies and support the development of more effective, targeted therapies in patients with CHF."

Dolan,2025-05-12,scientific communication and education,"Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) are thought to enhance students motivation to continue in college, in science, and in research. Yet, how CUREs enhance student motivation is largely undefined. Theories of instructor immediacy, self-efficacy, and task values suggest that CURE instructors may talk in ways that influence students motivational beliefs. We characterized the non-content related talk of instructors teaching 48 introductory biology lab courses, half CUREs and half non-CUREs. We identified 14 types of instructor talk that fit these theoretical perspectives: fostering students closeness with their instructor (i.e., immediacy talk), building students confidence in their scientific abilities (i.e., self-efficacy talk), and promoting students sense of worth in their work (i.e., task value talk). Course type had a medium effect on talk type, with CURE instructors utilizing more immediacy, self-efficacy, and task values talk than non-CURE instructors but also showing more variation in these types of talk. Our results suggest that motivation-related instructor talk is more prevalent in CUREs than non-CUREs, but wide variation in CURE instructor talk indicates additional investigation is needed before non-content talk can be considered a mechanism for the motivational influences of CUREs.

HIGHLIGHTThis study compares non-content instructor talk in CURE and non-CURE lab courses using immediacy, self-efficacy, and task value theories. CURE instructors use more talk than non-CURE instructors, but variation in CURE instructor talk leaves open the question of whether talk is a causal factor in the motivational influence of CURE instruction."

Meho,2025-05-12,scientific communication and education,"Global university rankings have transformed how certain institutions define success, often elevating metrics over meaning. This study examines universities with rapid research growth that suggest metric-driven behaviors. Among the 1,000 most publishing institutions, 98 showed extreme output increases between 2018-2019 and 2023-2024. Of these, 18 were selected for exhibiting sharp declines in first and corresponding authorship. Compared to national, regional, and international norms, these universities (in India, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates) display patterns consistent with strategic metric optimization. Key findings include publication growth of up to 965%, concentrated in STEM fields; surges in hyper-prolific authors and highly cited articles; and dense internal co-authorship and citation clusters. The group also exhibited elevated shares of publications in delisted journals and high retraction rates. These patterns illustrate vulnerabilities in global ranking systems, as metrics lose meaning when treated as targets (Goodharts Law) and institutions emulate high-performing peers under competitive pressure (institutional isomorphism). Without reform, rankings may continue incentivizing behaviors that distort scholarly contribution and compromise research integrity."

Traditional mentoring programs mitigate such challenges, yet faculty shortages and resource constraints necessitate exploration of alternative models. Artificial intelligence (AI) platforms such as ChatGPT offer potential supplemental mentoring support; however, their comparative effectiveness in health professions education remains underexplored.

MethodsThis comparative, convergent mixed-methods study was conducted at SEGi University, Malaysia, involving 31 Year 4 dental students receiving human mentoring and 36 Year 5 students utilizing ChatGPT as an AI mentor. Quantitative outcomes were assessed using the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), the Perceived Mentor Support Scale (PMSS), and the Mentoring Effectiveness Scale (MES). Qualitative data were collected through focus groups and analysis of ChatGPT interaction logs. Statistical analyses included paired t-tests and ANOVA, while thematic analysis was used for qualitative data integration.

ResultsYear 4 students demonstrated significant reductions in stress, anxiety, and depression scores (p < 0.001) and greater improvements in perceived mentor support (p < 0.001) and mentoring effectiveness (p < 0.001) compared to Year 5 students. Year 5 students reported modest gains following ChatGPT mentoring, highlighting strengths in accessibility and immediacy but limitations in emotional resonance. Qualitative themes underscored human mentors superior capacity for emotional attunement, while ChatGPT was valued for availability and practical support.

ConclusionsWhile AI-based mentoring via ChatGPT shows promise in enhancing mentoring accessibility, human mentorship remains critical for addressing the emotional and relational needs of dental students. Careful integration of AI tools into hybrid mentorship models could optimize support systems, particularly in resource-constrained educational environments. Future research should explore ethical frameworks and training strategies to enhance empathetic AI mentorship in health professions education."

Enns,2025-05-22,scientific communication and education,"This study reports on the outcomes of a formal peer-learning program for undergraduate science students. We implemented a cohort-based study buddy program in which high-scoring students (mentors) and lower-scoring peers (proteges) were invited to form study groups based on their first assessment scores in a given course. We then compared the performance of participants versus non-participants on subsequent assessments, while examining separately the effects for mentors and proteges. Results showed similar participation benefits for students in both mentor and protege roles. These findings emphasize the value of reducing barriers to collaborative learning in higher education and highlight the study buddy program as a cost-effective and scalable approach to enhance students educational experiences."

We launched a co-designed citizen science (CS) initiative within the HealthFerm project to collect sourdough fermentation data across Europe. Over 1000 participants from 33 countries registered, with 671 samples submitted, enabling large-scale analysis of fermentation practices, motivations, and sourdough characteristics. Participants also completed standardized at-home experiments and sensory evaluations, generating a dataset linking baking habits with physicochemical and sensory profiles. Distinct patterns emerged: professional bakers used older, more frequently refreshed starters and fermented at higher temperatures. Ingredient choices and motivations varied by country, shaped by perceived health benefits. Beyond data collection, this initiative established a microbial biobank and harmonized metadata resource, while offering practical insights into co- design, logistics, and public engagement. The resulting framework provides a transferable model for participatory research in microbiology and food systems science."

Amaral,2025-05-28,scientific communication and education,"There is a widely-held perception that science is becoming increasingly international -- both in terms of collaborations involving authors form multiple countries and in terms of publications from authors from a broader group of countries -- and more interdisciplinary, i.e., drawing on knowledge and methods from multiple scholarship domains. However, these hypothesized trends have not yet been characterized quantitatively at the level of individual discipline. The widespread availability of scholarly metadata on scientific publications makes it possible to examine how science has evolved over time. Here, we use OpenAlex metadata to examine potential trends in two groups of peer-reviewed research journals: disciplinary journals in biology, chemistry, economics, medicine, physics, and political science, and multidisciplinary journals that publish articles from multiple fields. Supporting existing perceptions, we find an almost universal trend towards increasing internationalization of both sets of journals. Nevertheless, we find disparities: journals in medicine are less international than journals in other disciplines and are not increasing their levels of internationalization, whereas journals in physics appear to be segregating between those that are international and those that are not. We also find that multidisciplinary journals have undergone significant shifts in their disciplinary focuses over the past century, whereas disciplinary journals appear to have largely maintained their degree of interdisciplinarity."

Research institutions typically respond to this need by providing mandatory or optional training opportunities for their staff. However, there is no established resource for group leaders to improve their lab culture with concrete action points for implementation. Here, we introduce the SAFE Labs Handbook: a collection of thirty ""commitments"" which can be verifiably actioned without requiring institutional support. These commitments were collaboratively developed by thirteen group leaders in life sciences, from institutions across eight countries, instigated through the 2024 SAFE Labs workshop. The importance of each commitment has been scored by more than 200 researchers, at various career stages, from more than twenty countries. Even though all commitments were rated as significantly important by scientists from all career stages, implementation rates were notably low (< 25%). Lab members reported higher importance scores than group leaders, with large divergences indicating where group leaders may underestimate the potential impact on lab culture. Indeed, the overall implementation rate was correlated with importance score for group leaders, but not lab members. Strikingly, more than 95% of group leaders said they would consider implementing the handbook commitments. Given the high importance-scores and low-implementation rates, the SAFE Labs Handbook represents a unique, community-driven tool with significant potential to improve lab culture on a global scale."

W.",Ashebir Mekonnen Chengere,2025-05-30,scientific communication and education,"Attitude plays a vital role in achieving modern science education goals by enhancing students conceptual understanding, motivation, academic performance, interest, and engagement in scientific inquiry. However, in many Ethiopian schools, attitudes toward science are often overlooked, and traditional teacher-centered instruction combined with limited resources hampers their development. To address these issues this study examined the effect of guided inquiry-based laboratory experiments enriched instruction (GIBLEI) on secondary school students attitudes toward biology, using a quasi-experimental design with pretest-treatment-posttest phases. Two classes from selected schools were randomly assigned to an experimental group (EG, N=46) and a control group (CG, N=29). Over eight weeks, the EG received GIBLEI, while the CG experienced traditional laboratory experiments enriched instruction (TLEI). Attitudes were measured using a 5-point Likert scale. The results showed that GIBLEI significantly improved students overall attitude towards biology, enthusiasm for biology, perception of biology as a course, and understanding of biology as a process, compared to TLEI. However, it did not affect their views of biology as a career. GIBLEI also promoted gender inclusivity by reducing attitude differences between male and female students. These findings highlight the benefits of GIBLEI in fostering positive attitudes, engagement, and inclusivity in biology education, enhancing both student outcomes and equity in science learning."

Theobald,2025-06-02,scientific communication and education,"We updated a recent meta-analysis of active learnings impact on student achievement in undergraduate STEM courses by following the same protocol to evaluate studies published from 2010-2017. We screened 1659 papers, coded 1294, and found 210 that met five pre-established inclusion criteria and six pre-established criteria for methodological quality. After further dropping 76 studies with no exam scores data, 134 of these studies contained data on student performance on identical or equivalent exams. We found that on average, active learnings effect size on exam scores was 0.519 {+/-} 0.049, meaning that when students are in active learning classes, they perform roughly half a standard deviation higher on an identical exam. Funnel plots and sensitivity analyses indicated that these results were not due to sampling bias. Active learning had a positive impact on student outcomes regardless of class size, course level, or STEM discipline, though there was heterogeneity in the effects. All of these results are very similar when compared to earlier meta-analyses, however increased resolution in the studies analyzed here revealed two novel results. First, student performance was significantly better in courses that employed high-intensity active learning, defined as students being on task at least two-thirds of class time, versus lower-intensities. Additionally, there was significant heterogeneity in efficacy across different types of active learning employed. These results suggest that most, if not all types of active learning are effective, and that when innovating in their classes, instructors should continually work to increase active learning intensity. We urge caution in interpreting the results on active learning types, however, and propose a preliminary framework for making more-sophisticated and reliable analyses of variation in course design. Finally, the evidence presented here for active learnings impact on student outcomes creates a strong foundation for faculty professional development and administration."

For non-white researchers, this process involves complex negotiations that remain understudied, particularly among those stereotyped as ""model minorities."" This qualitative study examines how Asian and Asian American early-career scientists navigate their racial and cultural identities within scientific writing and publication processes. Drawing on interviews with 23 participants who engaged with the Journal of Emerging Investigators, we identified two primary approaches to identity navigation: ""spurring,"" wherein racial and cultural backgrounds catalyze research questions and scientific inquiry, and ""siloing,"" wherein these identities are deliberately compartmentalized during formal scientific writing. Using an integrated theoretical framework combining cultural community wealth, narrative identity, and model minority discourse, we analyzed how participants strategically deployed cultural resources while navigating institutional expectations. Our findings reveal that while participants drew upon familial capital to inform research interests and occasionally acknowledged reflexivity, most also practiced disciplinary compartmentalization and adhered to perceived scientific norms of objectivity. This tension demonstrates how early-career scientists negotiate competing cultural scripts while developing professional identities. These findings have significant implications for science education, suggesting the need to help students recognize cultural backgrounds as valuable resources rather than sources of bias, address myths of pure objectivity, and provide models of successful identity integration in scientific work. By documenting these navigation strategies, we contribute to understanding both individual agency and institutional constraints in scientific practice, particularly for students from backgrounds historically underrepresented in STEM fields."

Yet, undergraduate students struggle to make sense of proteins and apply knowledge about why structure affects function. Here, we expand on an existing typology of common protein misconceptions (Robic, 2010). We recruited participants from a large, lecture-based non-major biochemistry course to participate in a series of assessments that allowed us to qualitatively examine their responses. We found that the common misconceptions included: protein stability based on orientation, confusions about the inherent dynamic properties of proteins, and protein structure related to function. We surmise that all three of these newly reported, nuanced misconceptions are the product of difficulties with visuospatial reasoning."

Here, we present a case study of FFS in the Katete district, Eastern province of Zambia, focused on good pigeon pea agronomic practices and the value chain. Three FFSs were established, focusing on a variety of trials, bio-pesticides, and a pigeon pea-specific rhizobial inoculant. Extreme weather conditions, an underdeveloped pigeon pea seed value chain, and a poor seed system hindered the implementation of the FFSs. To strengthen the pigeon pea seed value chain, a seed dehuller is now available to farmers. Our results highlight the importance of the design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of the FFSs. Pigeon pea FFSs will support crop and food diversification, improve soil fertility and sustainable agriculture, and may increase household income."

K.; Sen, M.; Sengupta, S.; Maity, W.; Palapetta, S.; Jha, A.",Abhishek Jha,2025-06-11,scientific communication and education,"High-quality metadata is essential for downstream AI applications, yet metadata curation remains a persistent bottleneck in biomedical research. The core challenge lies in balancing quality and scalability. Manual curation delivers high quality, reliable annotations but is time-intensive and non-scalable; automated approaches, including those based on natural language processing, can scale but often fall short in accuracy and completeness. This tradeoff is particularly severe in public datasets, where metadata is frequently distributed across multiple sources for a single dataset. A notable example includes multi-omics datasets available on GEO and similar public repositories, which are often accompanied by associated publications. These supplementary sources can be leveraged to substantially enhance metadata quality, thereby supporting downstream applications such as classifier model development or the identification of biologically relevant cohorts, etc.

We present a first-in-class multi-agent AI system that bridges the gap, achieving both high quality and scalability in metadata curation. Built on large-language models (LLMs), our system orchestrates a set of specialized agents that collaboratively extract, normalize, and infer critical metadata fields such as tissue, disease, cell line, sampling site, demographics, and experimental context from GEO entries, associated publications. A central orchestrator agent delegates tasks such as data retrieval, document parsing, ontology mapping, and context inference to expert sub-agents, enabling scalable, end-to-end automation.

Applied to GEO data sets, a notoriously difficult metadata domain, our system achieves a 93% recall on average across 23 key fields (all original terms, normalized terms, and corresponding ontology ids) that include information about disease, tissue, treatment, donor-related information, outperforming existing automated baselines and approaches expert level quality. We also present a system that can easily scale to curate hundreds of metadata fields of interest with similar precision. This work demonstrates that an LLM-based multi-agent architecture can overcome traditional trade-offs in metadata curation, enabling both precision and scale, and offers a promising path forward for curating large public biomedical repositories for downstream AI applications."

T.",Trevor T Tuma,2025-06-13,scientific communication and education,"Instructor use of humor can positively affect students educational experiences by increasing students comfort in the classroom and making the instructor seem more approachable. Humor can also elicit emotional responses, which in turn may influence students engagement in the course and their relationship with the instructor. However, students may interpret instructor humor differently, resulting in varied effects. The present study examined how instructors use of humor relates to students emotions about their lab course. In addition, we examined whether researcher-identified humor aligned with student reports to support valid inferences about instructor humor. To accomplish this, trained researchers analyzed classroom audio recordings of instructor talk in 48 lab courses to identify instances of instructor humor. We also surveyed their undergraduate students (n = 462) about their instructors humor and pleasant and unpleasant emotions about their lab course. Our results revealed that trained researchers coding of instructor humor was poorly predictive of students emotions about their laboratory courses. In contrast, students who perceived their instructor to be humorous reported greater pleasant emotions and fewer unpleasant emotions. Our results suggest that instructor humor from students perspective may be influential in how they experience instruction. In addition, student perceptions of instructor humor may be a more useful indicator than researcher observations for studying instructor humor."

Effective interpretation of colors relies on accurate, intuitive, and accessible colormaps that are properly labeled. Misuse of colormaps, such as using rainbow, mismatched, and other inaccessible colormaps, hinders reader interpretation. Despite their ubiquitous use to represent biological data, the prevalence of colormap misuse has not been quantified. Using established guidelines, we analyzed over 6,000 articles in 10 high-impact biological journals spanning 2020-2024 to quantify the prevalence of colormap use and misuse. Over 67% of articles contain at least one colormap, of which 81% contain some form of misuse. Among the over 11,000 acquired colormap-associated figures, 60% contain some form of misuse. Heatmaps, scatter plots, images, and image overlays are the most commonly used figures with colormaps.

P.",Mary  Pat Wenderoth,2025-06-16,scientific communication and education,"Myriad studies support the claim that active learning improves student academic performance in STEM, yet lecture remains the dominant form of instruction. Faculty offer multiple reasons for not using active learning with many expressing confusion as to what active learning is. Contributing to that confusion is the fact there are a multitude of named active learning methods and varied implementations of each. In an effort to better understand how specific elements of active learning might contribute to enhanced academic performance, we used a more fine-grained classroom observation tool, PORTAAL, to observe teaching practices across 157 STEM courses. We used a principal component analysis to reduce the observed teaching practices to specific sets of practices. We found a continuum of implementation of teaching practices that ranged from instruction-centered to learner-centered. The instruction-centered practices included high Blooms level questions, students working alone, instructors answering and explaining questions, and providing alternative answers. The learner-centered practices were volunteer or randomly-called students explaining answers, instructors prompting students logic, and instructors giving positive feedback. Using a linear regression to analyze the data from all courses, we found medium and medium-high levels of learner-centered teaching practices correlated with higher student exam performance compared to instruction-centered practices. We observed a similar pattern when analyzing data only from introductory courses. We also analyzed interactions of both binary gender and first generation status with learner-centered teaching on exam scores.

We propose that when instructors use the learner-centered practices, they shift the responsibility of the intellectual work of the problem-the learning-to the students, which may result in improved exam performance. Even moderate levels of these learner-centered practices have a positive correlation with exam performance. Faculty can incorporate these key elements of learner-centered practices into their own teaching based on their comfort level, course content, and abilities of their students."

In temperate regions such as southern Sweden, it presents both opportunities, such as longer growing seasons, and challenges, including increased drought and heat stress. This study examined how Swedish agriculture is adapting to climate change, using the extreme 2018 drought and heatwave as a critical case to explore both immediate responses and longer-term preparedness in crop production systems. We compared scientific and local knowledge through a systematic scoping review of peer-reviewed literature from northern Europe, a workshop with project scientists, and a participatory workshop with farmers. The study aimed to identify gaps between scientific and local understandings of climate change adaptation, particularly in how extreme events influence decision-making and preparedness. Using a transdisciplinary, problem-feeding approach, we compared how farmers and scientists conceptualise crisis response and long-term adaptation, employing influence diagrams to visualise their understandings. Our review found that much scientific work focuses on short-term coping strategies, such as feed substitution or altered irrigation, while longer-term adaptation remains underexplored. In contrast, farmers emphasized context specific actions grounded in their farm operations, highlighting socio-economic and administrative constraints, whereas scientists tended to propose generalisable technology-oriented strategies. These differences underscore the importance of integrating both experiential and scientific knowledge to co-develop more effective adaptation responses. The study lays the foundation for a targeted, large-scale survey to explore farmer motivations, perceptions of risk and opportunity, and adaptive capacities across diverse contexts. Our findings highlight the need to move beyond reactive measures and investigate anticipatory strategies that foster and enable adaptive capacity. Here we demonstrate that supporting long-term adaptation in agriculture will require inclusive, evidence-based approaches that incorporate perspectives from farmers, advisors, scientists, and public authorities alike."

R.; Putri, A. N. M.; Ikhromi, N.; Divina, E.; Gabrielle, A.",Pukovisa Prawiroharjo,2025-06-27,scientific communication and education,"IntroductionMicroplastics (MPs) have emerged as pervasive environmental contaminants, with growing concerns about their potential health impacts, including neurocognitive effects. In Indonesia, where plastic pollution is severe, no validated tool exists to assess public plastic use patterns and MP awareness in relation to cognitive health.

ObjectiveThis study aimed to develop and validate a comprehensive questionnaire evaluating plastic consumption behaviors, MP knowledge, attitudes, and their association with cognitive function in Indonesian adults.

Material and methodsA cross-sectional pilot study was conducted with 30 participants (80% female, mean age 37.4{+/-}13.7 years). The questionnaire was developed through literature review, expert consultation, and focus group discussions, covering six domains: demographics, health history, MP knowledge, plastic use behaviors, environmental attitudes, and cognitive screening (AD-8). Validity was assessed using Pearsons correlation, and reliability was measured via Cronbachs alpha.

ResultThe questionnaire demonstrated strong validity for knowledge (r=0.379, p=0.039), behavior (r=0.726, p<0.001), and attitude sections (r=0.385, p=0.036), with acceptable reliability (=0.623). Neurocognitive assessment revealed significantly lower AD-8 scores in participants with cognitive decline (mean=11.14) versus normal cognition (mean=18.03, p=0.038). Key findings included high single-use plastic consumption, limited awareness of MP regulations (70% uninformed), and an attitude-behavior gap in mitigation efforts.

DiscussionThe tool effectively identified MP knowledge gaps and behavioral risks while suggesting a plausible link between plastic exposure and cognitive impairment. The AD-8s sensitivity and specificity supported its utility for screening, though the modest sample size limited statistical power for correlation analyses.

ConclusionThis validated questionnaire provides a critical foundation for assessing MP-related cognitive risks in Indonesia. Future studies should expand validation in larger cohorts and investigate causal mechanisms. The findings underscore the need for public education and policy interventions to reduce plastic exposure."

This study analyzed differences in external load, measured as Player Load, across various pitch types using a GPS-based wearable device. Additionally, the relationship between Player Load and ball velocity was examined.

MethodsFour male collegiate Division I baseball players from China (age: 18.5 {+/-} 0.58 years, height: 181.00 {+/-} 6.83 cm, weight: 78.00 {+/-} 5.48 kg) participated in this study. External loads were collected for four pitch types, fastball, changeup, curveball, and slider, using a wearable sensor device that recorded six variables: Maximum Player Load (Max PL), Maximum Rotation (Max Rot), Pitching Hourly Velocity, and Percentage of Acceleration Change in the Three Axes (Up Load %, Side Load %, and Fwd Load %). A Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test was used to assess differences across pitch types, while stepwise multiple regression analyzed the impact of Player Load on pitching speed.

ResultsSignificant differences were observed among pitch types for Max PL, Max Rot, Hourly Speed, Up Load %, and Fwd Load % (p<0.05), while Side Load % did not show a significant difference (p>0.05). Stepwise multiple regression indicated that pitching speed was influenced by Max PL, with the equation: mph = 78.816 + 7.001 Max PL, R2 = 0.192, suggesting that Max PL accounted for 19.2% of the variability in pitching speed.

DiscussionExternal training loads in pitching vary by pitch type, with variable-speed pitches generating higher peak external loads, whereas fastballs are associated with greater ball speeds."

Democracy ratings used the Democracy Index in 2024 and in 2006 (when first released by the Economist Intelligence Unit) and Freedom of Press ratings used the 2024 index by Reports Without Borders. The Scopus database was used for publications from each country. Fractional counts were assigned for publications co-authored by authors from different countries. Full articles, reviews, conference papers, books and book chapters were included. In 2024, countries characterized as full democracies produced only 22% of the Scopus-indexed publications, versus 66% in 2006. There was no correlation between the ratio of publications indexed in 2024 versus 2006 and the absolute or relative change in Democracy Index between 2006 and 2024 (r=0.02 and r=0.00, respectively). 78% of publications in 2024 came from countries with problematic (including USA) or worse (including China) freedom of press. Proportions of publications originated from countries with problematic or worse situations were 81%, 91%, 61%, 62%, and 63% for political, economic, legislative, sociocultural, and safety/security dimensions, respectively. Results were similar when limited to articles published in 2024 in journals with continuous annual presence in Scopus during 2006-2024. In conclusion, most published science originates from countries struggling or suffering in democracy and/or freedom of press. The deeper causes and implications of this emerging landscape require further study."

P. A.",Antonio Cristiano,2025-07-09,scientific communication and education,"ImportanceRetractions are rare but increasingly common in scientific publishing. Understanding whether gender disparities exist in retraction rates, especially among top-performing scientists, may inform broader efforts to promote equity and research integrity.

ObjectiveTo assess gender disparities in the likelihood of having retracted publications among highly cited and all other authors, and to explore how these vary across scientific fields, countries, and publication age cohorts.

DesignCross-sectional bibliometric analysis incorporating retraction data into Scopus-based databases of top-cited scientists (top 2%) and all authors with [&ge;]5 publications. Retraction data were obtained from Retraction Watch and linked with author-level citation metrics.

SettingGlobal, science-wide analysis using data from authors in all disciplines indexed in Scopus.

ParticipantsA total of 10,361,367 authors with [&ge;]5 publications were included; 217,097 were among the top 2% most-cited authors. Gender was confidently assigned using NamSor for 8,267,888 authors. Authors with uncertain gender were excluded from gender-specific analyses.

Main Outcomes and MeasuresGender-specific retraction rates and the relative propensity (R) of women vs men to have at least one retraction, overall and stratified by citation status, field, country income level, publication age cohort and publication volumes.

ResultsAmong highly cited authors, retraction rates were 3.3% in men and 2.9% in women; among all authors, rates were 0.7% for both genders. Differences varied by field: womens rates were at least one-third lower than mens (R < 0.67) in Biology, Biomedical Research, and Psychology (R{square}< {square}0.67), but higher (R{square}> {square}1.33) in Economics, Engineering, and Information and Communication Technologies. Among highly cited authors, younger cohorts showed increasingly higher rates among men (4.2% men vs. 3.0% women in those starting to publish in 2002-2011; 8.7% men vs. 4.9% women in those starting post-2011). Country-level differences among highly cited authors were pronounced in some countries, as in Pakistan (28.7% men vs. 14.3% women). Among all authors, country-level gender differences were small.

Conclusions and RelevanceGender differences in retraction rates exist but are modest. Field, country, and publication volume are stronger correlates. Structural and contextual factors likely drive retraction patterns and warrant further investigation.

KEY POINTSO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSAre there gender disparities in the likelihood of having retracted publications among highly cited scientists and the broader scientific population?

FindingsIn this cross-sectional bibliometric analysis of over 10 million authors with at least 5 publications, including 217,097 top-cited scientists, retraction rates were slightly lower in women than in men. Gender differences were modest compared with disparities by country, field, and citation volume, but varied across disciplines and publication age cohorts.

MeaningGender is a minor correlate of retraction, and structural or contextual factors likely drive retraction patterns in science."

A.; Jiang, H.; Di Cara, F.; Kurant, E.; David, F.; Lemaitre, B.",Bruno Lemaitre,2025-07-09,scientific communication and education,"The ReproSci project retrospectively analyzed the reproducibility of 1006 claims from 400 papers published between 1959 and 2011 in the field of Drosophila immunity. This project attempts to provide a comprehensive assessment, 14 years later, of the replicability of nearly all publications across an entire scientific community in experimental life sciences. We found that 61% of claims were verified, while only 7% were directly challenged (not reproducible), a replicability rate higher than previous assessments. Notably, 24% of claims had never been independently tested and remain unchallenged. We performed experimental validations of a selection of 45 unchallenged claim, that revealed that a significant fraction (38/45) of them is in fact non-reproducible. We also found that high-impact journals and top-ranked institutions are more likely to publish challenged claims. In line with the reproducibility crisis narrative, the rates of both challenged and unchallenged claims increased over time, especially as the field gained popularity. We characterized the uneven distribution of irreproducibility among first and last authors. Surprisingly, irreproducibility rates were similar between PhD students and postdocs, and did not decrease with experience or publication count. However, group leaders, who had prior experience as first authors in another team in the field, had lower irreproducibility rates, underscoring the importance of early-career training. Finally, authors with a more exploratory, short-term engagement with the field exhibited slightly higher rates of challenged claims and a markedly higher proportion of unchallenged ones. This systematic, field-wide retrospective study offers meaningful insights into the ongoing reproducibility crisis in experimental life sciences."

A.; Al Faris, E.; Sattar, K.; Ahmed, A. M.",Syed  Irfan Karim,2025-07-10,scientific communication and education,"BackgroundKnowledge and use of contraceptives, including emergency contraception (EC), remain limited in Saudi Arabia due to cultural, religious, and gender-related influences. This qualitative study explores the knowledge, perceptions, and barriers related to contraceptive and EC use among married Saudi men and women.

MethodsFocus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted with purposively sampled married men and women at a university-affiliated government hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Data was analyzed thematically to explore participants beliefs, attitudes, and experiences regarding contraceptive and emergency contraception use.

ResultsMen expressed positive attitudes toward EC use. Overall, understanding of contraception was limited. The identified barriers for use of EC were lack of information, misconceptions, fear of side effects, social norms, and religious beliefs. Participants highlighted the importance of enhancing education through premarital counseling and public awareness programs.

ConclusionsThis study highlights the need for improved education on contraception. Given the influence of male perspectives on contraceptive use, increasing awareness by culturally appropriate, gender-sensitive educational strategies to dispel myths and promote informed contraceptive decision-making could be a valuable intervention to enhance contraceptive uptake in Saudi Arabia"

Y.-S.; Zeng, Z.; Gorjifard, S.; Dunham, M. J.",Maitreya J. Dunham,2025-07-22,scientific communication and education,"Experimental evolution is a powerful method for studying the relationship between genotype and phenotype by observing how populations genetically adapt to controlled selective pressures. In educational settings, this approach also offers a dynamic way for students to engage with molecular genetics. One such educational effort, known as ""yEvo"" (yeast evolution), introduces experimental evolution into high school classrooms, allowing students to evolve the bakers yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae under various stressors and investigate the resulting de novo genetic changes. While the hands-on experiments have been successful in fostering student interest and understanding of evolution, the downstream data analysis--interpreting whole-genome sequencing results of evolved yeast compared to the ancestor--remains a challenge. Students often struggle to grasp the significance of their mutated genes and lack the broader context to determine which mutations are most phenotypically relevant. To address these issues, we developed the yEvo Mutation Browser, an intuitive web tool designed to assist students and researchers alike in visualizing and contextualizing genome sequencing data. Developed using R Shiny, this tool features an interactive chromosome map displaying mutated genes, graphs categorizing mutation types, and a gene viewer illustrating specific mutation sites within genes. The app also features an option for non-yEvo-affiliated users to upload their own experimental evolution or genetic screen datasets and compare them with all yEvo data collected since 2018. The yEvo Mutation Browser streamlines data interpretation, helping students understand how organisms employ diverse genetic strategies to adapt to environmental stress. In the future, this framework could be adapted for use with other model organisms, offering a valuable resource for both genetics research and education.

SummaryThe yEvo project, a collaboration between high school classrooms and university yeast research laboratories, allows students to experimentally evolve yeast and observe the effects of mutations and natural selection in real time. The yEvo Mutation Browser, a new web tool, enables users to visualize the evolved strains mutations at both the gene and chromosome levels, compare their findings with other classrooms using various conditions, and even upload their own data, benefiting both educators and the yeast genetics community."

T.",Luan Trong Nguyen,2025-07-22,scientific communication and education,"In the context of Vietnams higher education strongly transforming towards digitalization and sustainability, this study aims to analyze the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on students awareness and intention to act for the environment. Based on the Extended Planned Behavior (TPB) model, the research model integrates two input factors: environmental awareness (EA) and the level of interaction with AI in environmental learning (AEEL), affecting three mediating factors: attitude (AT), subjective norm (SN) and perceived behavioral control (PBC), thereby predicting students green action intention (GAI). Data collected from 521 students at private university in Vietnam were processed using EFA, CFA and SEM. The results showed that both EA and AEEL had positive effects on AT, SN and PBC (p < 0.001). Among them, AEEL had the strongest influence on SN ({beta} = 0.281) and PBC ({beta} = 0.252). PBC had the strongest influence on GAI ({beta} = 0.312), followed by AT ({beta} = 0.274) and SN ({beta} = 0.267). Bootstrapping mediation analysis confirmed that the mediating variables (AT, SN, PBC) played an important role in linking EA and AEEL with GAI. In addition, cluster analysis showed that female students and senior students had significantly higher levels of AI engagement and action intention. These results suggest that AI not only serves as a learning support tool but also as a catalyst for sustainable behavior in higher education."

C.",Alex C Keene,2025-07-25,scientific communication and education,"According to the US Census Bureau (2019) there are approximately 95 million people in the US 55 years of age and older, and that number is expected to increase dramatically in the next decade. This growing population results in an increasing need for STEM learning opportunities for older adults. This need is partially met by lifelong learning communities across the country that offer non-degree programs on a broad range of topics. While many of these programs are located on a college campus, there are few opportunities for interaction between lifelong learners and students in degree-oriented programs. To improve access to STEM education for lifelong learners, we generated an intergenerational classroom composed of lifelong learners and undergraduate students. The semester-long course focused on the biography and medical writings of the late neurologist Oliver Sacks. Our analysis revealed a high level of satisfaction from both undergraduate students and lifelong learners. Both groups overwhelmingly found the intergenerational format beneficial to learning. Furthermore, self-assessments revealed that students felt more positively about intergenerational interactions following completion of the course. Overall, this course provides a framework for increasing access to STEM for the growing older adult population and fostering positive intergenerational interactions. This model could be readily implemented across the country given the abundance of lifelong learning programs currently affiliated with colleges and universities."

While scholars across disciplines have long analyzed the evolution of U.S. immigration regimes and citizenship privilege, there remains a critical lack of quantitative data on the financial, temporal, and psychological burdens associated with visa bureaucracy. Here we present original survey data from more than 700 international postdoctoral researchers at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and its affiliated institutions, revealing how visa-related burdens directly impact scholars and their research. For example, over 40% of scholars reported spending more than a month in their home countries to renew U.S. visas, with 5% spending more than six months. Scholars from Asia experienced longer delays and higher costs than those from Europe. Seventy-five percent of respondents reported mental health challenges related to visa stress, often feeling trapped at work, with some requiring medication and time off. Our findings underscore the urgent need for targeted institutional support to promote research productivity, equitable opportunity, and mental well-being. As the U.S. repositions itself as a global scientific leader, such reforms will be critical to recruiting and retaining top talent and advancing equity in science."

However, there is relatively little research on stakeholders perceptions of rehoming. We explored the views of three key groups: the people who volunteer to rehome these animals, the animal technicians who care for these animals prior to rehoming, and the researchers who are normally responsible for most of the interactions between people and these animals. To do this, we carried out a thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews. Our aim was to obtain insights that could inform reflection and guide future research priorities around rehoming programmes. Our study demonstrated support for laboratory rodent rehoming in all stakeholder groups. Rehomers and technicians comments focused chiefly on the potential benefits of rehoming to the animal and benefits to institutional openness. Researchers made similar comments, but in this group, these comments were tempered by concerns around the welfare of the animals after rehoming, the fate of animals that cannot be rehomed, rehomers health and well-being, and the potential risks associated with the transparency of individuals and the institutions use of animals in research. We discuss these themes in the context of the ethics of laboratory animal use, manifesting a Culture of Care, and challenges around enhancing institutional openness on animal research."

The study explores human attitudes toward insects via a 17-question Google Forms survey, finding consistent perceptions across demographics, except for education level, which impacts ecological awareness and tolerance. A notable exception was the belief that all insects are harmful, which varied significantly by age, and gender differences in handling dangerous insects. Principal Component Analysis identified three key dimensions--environmental awareness, demographic influences, and emotional responses-- explaining 38% of the variance. The findings highlight paradoxes in public views, such as recognizing insects ecological value while expressing discomfort with their presence. Education emerges as a critical factor in fostering positive attitudes, suggesting targeted campaigns could bridge knowledge gaps and promote coexistence with these essential creatures."

Connected to this, there is an increasing research interest in improving childhood nature experiences and environmental awareness through direct outdoor educational activities. While this research largely remains geographically biassed to the nature of temperate regions, global and national policies are pushing towards place-based outdoor environmental education in other geographies where research and theory-practice gap persists. The existing environmental outdoor education literature identifies the on-ground challenges, mostly from educators perspectives and focusing on academic achievements of participants. A better understanding of culturally specific, locally appropriate, and diverse pedagogies, drawing on both childrens and educators voices and relational values is required to fill this gap. We studied [~]20 years old, unique place-based conservation education sessions on the rock outcrops in Kannur (Kerala, India), facilitated by schools and non-governmental organizations. These sessions introduce children to the experience, ecology and conservation issues of rocky outcrops, an easily accessible local socio-ecological system. Considering this as a case-study, using mixed-methods, we aimed to assess (i) if and how these outdoor sessions improve socio-scientific understanding, and positive attitudes towards these habitats and their conservation in children, and to (ii) identify the sessions strengths, challenges, and relational values reflected in them through long-term experiences of its participants and educators. Our within-participant pre- and post-outdoor session surveys showed quantitative evidence for short-term increase in overall knowledge, but not any notable changes in measured attitudes or interests. But, the qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews with children and educators revealed major strengths of the sessions around the Natureculture elements, and relational values; while the challenges were mostly around educators understanding of children, pedagogical design, and logistics. Drawing on the long-term experiences of educators and children in the backdrop of existing global literature on outdoor education, we provide new insights on how using the power of emotions and experiences, positive and solution-oriented outlooks, unique socio-ecological elements, and relational values can be beneficial in designing conservation education sessions in often overlooked geographic and cultural contexts."

Most livestock farmers seek assistance from para-veterinary workers, who fall under the definition of Veterinary Paraprofessionals (VPPs), according to the World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH). There is a shortage of information concerning the awareness of these para-veterinary workers regarding tick control and management. This study aims to bridge this critical knowledge gap by conducting a cross-sectional survey that evaluates the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of para-veterinary workers about tick-borne diseases (TBDs) in Pakistan. Between March and August 2023, we conducted a web-based survey among para-veterinary workers recruited via email, text message, and face-to-face conversations. Poisson regression was used to identify factors associated with knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) scores related to TBDs. We received 118 responses from three provinces; only 27.9% (n = 33) responded that they had attended workshops related to ticks and TBDs. Attending workshops was associated with higher KAP scores. All section scores were correlated, and higher knowledge scores were significantly associated with lower odds of tick exposure. Our findings suggest that workshop attendance is important in increasing overall awareness and promoting better practices regarding TBDs."

Most environmental behavior research focuses on Western or large developing countries, leaving significant gaps in understanding small developing nations with unique cultural frameworks.

ObjectiveThis study explored youth perceptions, communication preferences, and content effectiveness for waste management education within Bhutans Buddhist collectivist culture, addressing identified research gaps in small developing countries.

MethodsA convergent mixed-methods design combined quantitative surveys (n=185) with qualitative interviews (n=10) at Yangchenphug Higher Secondary School in Thimphu, Bhutan. The theoretical framework integrated Theory of Planned Behavior, Social Learning Theory, Diffusion of Innovations Theory, and Community-Based Social Marketing principles.

ResultsStudents demonstrated exceptionally high environmental awareness (99.5%) and positive attitudes toward waste separation (mean scores 4.4-4.8 on 5-point scales). Social media emerged as the overwhelmingly preferred communication channel (78.4%), with videos being the most engaging content format (81.6%). Key barriers included time constraints (61.6%), infrastructure limitations (51.9%), and motivational challenges (46.5%). Notably, social influence showed only moderate impact (mean=3.7), lower than typically found in collectivist cultures. Qualitative analysis revealed five themes: shared responsibility burdens, engagement sustainability challenges, system effectiveness limitations, civic values education needs, and institutional support requirements.

ConclusionsBhutanese youth show strong environmental awareness coupled with distinct motivational patterns where environmental behavior appears more individually driven than typically found in collectivist cultures, suggesting Buddhist values of personal responsibility create unique frameworks. Digital communication channels, particularly video content through social media, offer promising avenues for environmental education. A multifaceted approach combining improved infrastructure, educational reinforcement, and culturally-appropriate communication strategies is essential for promoting sustainable waste management practices among youth in similar contexts."

By comparing farmers willingness and actual cultivation decisions, and linking these to expectations on economic, agronomic, and environmental outcomes, we moved beyond attitudes to analyse choices. We used Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) to predict cultivation decisions and willingness to cultivate using Net Value of Expected Impact (NVEI) as a predictor. Integrating decision-making with willingness revealed drivers of adoption and barriers persisting despite positive attitudes. NVEI scores strongly predicted both willingness and cultivation decisions, with regional contrasts evident. In the Forested region, farmers anticipated greater economic and agronomic benefits but had lower expectations for biodiversity, suggesting a knowledge gap and a need for communication providing comparative evidence on biodiversity benefits. In the Lowland region, higher expectations for environmental benefits highlight the need for tailored information on biodiversity, landscape value, and ecological connectivity. Low scores for workload and management ease across all groups indicate uncertainty about practical aspects, supporting the need for targeted communication. Overall, regionally tailored, evidence-based guidelines can support informed decision-making."

B.; Mumba, C.",Chisoni Mumba,2025-08-16,scientific communication and education,"In this study, we aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of veterinary and para-veterinary professionals concerning antimicrobial resistance (AMR), in order to identify key drivers of inappropriate antimicrobial use and gaps in current stewardship efforts. Data was collected from a cross-sectional survey of 144 veterinary and para-veterinary professionals (n=144) using an online structured self-administered questionnaire in ZOHO software. We analyzed data using descriptive statistics and logistic regression in IBM SPSS Statistics Version 25.

The findings revealed a high foundational knowledge of AMR, with 66.7% correctly defining AMR. The majority of respondents (82%) acknowledged that overuse of antimicrobials reduces their effectiveness and expressed strong support for mitigation efforts, with 95.8% endorsing farmer education as a key strategy. However, significant gaps in practice persisted: 75% of animal owners frequently initiated antibiotic use without supervision; professionals largely relied on empirical treatment (62.5%); and only 20.8% of professionals routinely performed antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST), due to barriers like cost and laboratory accessibility. Logistic regression analysis revealed no significant associations between socio-demographic variables and levels of AMR knowledge or attitudes. This suggests that barriers to responsible antimicrobial use may be more structural than individual.

We conclude that while Zambian practicing veterinary and para-veterinary professionals possess strong AMR awareness and positive attitudes, risky practices do persist. We recommend strengthening AMR stewardship with a holistic One Health approach by improving veterinary services to promote more appropriate and effective antimicrobial use.

Author SummaryAntibiotics are essential for treating sick animals, but their misuse can lead to antimicrobial resistance, where bacteria no longer respond to the drugs meant to kill them. This problem threatens both animal and human health. In Zambia, veterinary and para-veterinary professionals are actively involved in administering treatments and supporting decisions related to antibiotic use in livestock and pets. We wanted to understand what these professionals know, believe, and do when it comes to using antibiotics responsibly.

To find out, we surveyed 144 veterinary and para-veterinary professionals from across the country. We learned that most of them were aware that misuse of antibiotics can make treatments less effective and that drug-resistant bacteria can spread between animals and people. Many also supported educating farmers and working with human health experts to tackle the issue. However, we also discovered that antibiotics were often used in animals without proper testing or diagnosis, mainly because of limited laboratory access and cost concerns.

Our findings show that while knowledge and attitudes are strong, actual practices need improvement. We believe improved access to diagnostic services, more explicit rules, and ongoing training can help veterinary and veterinary paraprofessionals protect both animal and public health from the growing threat of antibiotic resistance."

However, its potential to address complex global challenges remains underutilised. This study explores how to improve citizen science by involving the public in all stages of scientific research. Using participatory research methods, we conducted online surveys and group discussions with researchers, citizen scientists, and Indigenous people. Thematic coding was used to identify key challenges, opportunities, and best practices to enhance citizen science initiatives. Additionally, nine case studies were reported using the Standardised Data on Initiatives (STARDIT) reporting tool.

The study identifies key strategies for enhancing participant engagement and retention in citizen science initiatives. Findings underscore the importance of inclusive, evidence-informed approaches such as targeted outreach, fair compensation, tailored support, and co-creation practices. Ensuring data quality and fostering trust require adherence to FAIR data principles, transparent validation and sharing processes, and the establishment of ethical research partnerships. Persistent challenges include short-term funding, which undermines long-term project sustainability, and the lack of centralized support for ethics and project management. Formal recognition of citizen scientists through co-authorship, standardized training, and professional development opportunities can further strengthen involvement and build capacity. Finally, emerging technologies--including AI and open data platforms--present opportunities to scale and improve efficiency, provided they are implemented with appropriate ethical safeguards and investment.

Drawing together these insights, we provide 10 actionable recommendations for citizen science in the 21st century. These highlight the importance of embedding citizen science in national research infrastructure, education, and policy, alongside consistent evaluation and reporting, to improve its inclusivity, longevity, and impact. We conclude by arguing that as the world confronts climate change, public health crises, and biodiversity loss, broader public involvement in science is key for equitable, efficient and evidence-informed responses."

Despite their high representation in U.S. research institutions, international scholars often lack access to integrated resources that address how their immigration status influences career mobility, decision-making, and long-term career planning. To address this gap, we developed the Effective Career and Immigration Planning for International Scholars (ECIP) program, a seven-session workshop series designed to align participants career development with their U.S. immigration goals. Grounded in Social Cognitive Career Theory, the ECIP program introduces the concept of the immigration portfolio: a strategic collection of evidence documenting accomplishments and credentials valuable for both academic success metrics and an advanced degree holders permanent residence petition. Here, we present the pilot implementation of this program and report its evaluation, which included pre- and post-program surveys, weekly polls of call-to-action task, and follow-up communications with participants.

Our results demonstrate significant increases in participants self-reported knowledge and confidence to take action towards their career and immigration goals. Post-program survey responses showed higher agreement levels on understanding immigration portfolio preparation and permanent residence options, demonstrating the programs effectiveness in addressing knowledge gaps. Engagement data revealed that participants consistently completed the proposed action items from workshops, aligning with the sessions learning objectives. Participants considered the program relevant and empowering. Follow-up responses indicated continued progress toward the immigration goals of participants.

Our findings underscore the critical need for integrated career and immigration planning. The ECIP program offers a scalable, evidence-based model for supporting international scholars in navigating their professional development in the United States."

L.",Erin L Dolan,2025-08-19,scientific communication and education,"Undergraduate research experiences (UREs) and course-based UREs (CUREs) promote students scientific self-efficacy growth. Yet, how self-efficacy develops during research is not understood. Furthermore, what students do during research varies in ways that likely affect self-efficacy development. We sought to address these knowledge gaps by collecting scientific self-efficacy data from CURE and URE students at nine universities at the beginning, middle, and end of a single term of research. We leveraged a theoretical advancement, latent state-trait theory-revised, to disaggregate the components of students self-efficacy into stable or trait-like self-efficacy and dynamic or state-like self-efficacy. We determined that students scientific self-efficacy was moderately stable during their research, with the most malleable component being beliefs in their abilities to figure out data collection and explain results. We also surveyed students [~]45 times throughout their research experience to test the extent to which research hours and types of research tasks contributed to self-efficacy development. We found that students who completed more analytic tasks experienced significantly more self-efficacy growth than students who completed other types of tasks, while time spent on research was not influential. Our results illustrate the importance of engaging students in analytic tasks during CUREs and UREs for fostering their self-efficacy development.

Highlight for table of contentsUsing latent state-trait theory-revised, we found that students scientific self-efficacy was more stable than malleable over one research term. Beliefs about data collection and explaining results were most dynamic. Conducting more analytic tasks fostered self-efficacy, while the time spent and completion of other tasks had no effect."
10.1101/2025.08.22.671828,'The ship is going down and we are powerless'- The Impact of Federal Funding Changes on Researchers Training the Next Generation of Scientists,"Mastej, E.; Do, T.; Salles, A.",Arghavan Salles,2025-08-27,scientific communication and education,"IntroductionHistorically, federal grant terminations have been rare and almost exclusively used in cases of misconduct. Under the current presidential administration, however, grant terminations have been common, with thousands of grants terminated across federal agencies such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Science Foundation. Although there have been scattered reports of the impact of these terminations on individual researchers, there has not yet been a systematic investigation of the impact on the overall scientific community.

MethodsAs part of a survey for a larger study, we asked researchers involved in T32 training programs how likely they would be to go into science if they were a graduate student now (Likert-type item) and how federal funding changes have affected them and their labs (open-ended). We report mean and standard deviation for the Likert-type item (1=Not at all likely, 5=Extremely likely), and we performed inductive thematic analysis to analyze the open-ended responses. Two independent raters coded responses, developed a codebook, and applied the codebook to all responses. The interrater reliability was high, {kappa}=0.84.

ResultsOf the 490 researchers invited to participate in the survey, 277 (response rate 56.5%) completed it in full. Participants were relatively unlikely to choose to pursue science again, with only about one-third being somewhat or more likely to do so. Two hundred twenty-three people responded to the open-ended item about how federal funding changes have affected them. Coding resulted in 48 unique codes which fell into four themes: Impact on Finances, Impact on Trainees, Impact on Science, and Well-being. Participants described instability in their labs, concern for trainees well-being and careers, concern about the future of the entire scientific enterprise, and negative impacts on their and others well-being.

DiscussionOur data demonstrates the significant, overwhelmingly negative impact of the changes in federal funding on researchers involved in training the next generation of scientists. Not only are they concerned about how they can continue to do the work they have dedicated their lives to, but they are also worried about the future of science in the United States. This latter concern stems not only from the decreasing availability and reliability of federal funding but also due to the impact all this is having on trainees ability to do their research and find jobs where they can do science. These data are a call to action to our federal agencies, institutions, other agencies, and donors who understand the value of science to support researchers through these uncertain times. Otherwise, what has taken decades to build will be eliminated by a few anti-scientific decisions."

S.; Yates, B.; Cunningham, R.",Brent Vasquez,2025-08-28,scientific communication and education,"Every animal protocol requires careful review to ensure humane principles, laws, and policies are followed before any experiments may be performed. Developing protocols and receiving approval can be a lengthy process requiring multiple rounds of feedback and refinement. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to improve the quality and speed of IACUC protocol reviews by detecting submission errors. We describe an approach to achieve this and show that our approach can be replicated, while addressing issues of ethics and bias, robustness, and trustworthiness1. Replication is addressed by developing a template and demonstrating that it can be reused. Ethics and bias issues are addressed by early, limited use of a large language Model (LLM) to identify errors and rapidly provide useful feedback to the protocol developer. In our approach, subsequent steps still require a review by the IACUC board, which retains ethical responsibility for approval. Robustness and trustworthiness were evaluated by using the template that is replicated for eleven distinct checks and performed on 50 new protocols using two different LLMs. We show that every actual problem in those submissions (within the test parameters) is found by our AI review (i.e., recall=100%), giving IACUC boards confidence in the utility of our system. In addition, precision for our checks is between 80%-100%, with most being 100%, thereby making the system a practical compliment to administrative protocol review for those submitting. Overall, we report F1 scores of between 89-100%."
10.1101/2025.08.25.672071,Beyond adoption rates: Farmer motivations and communication needs in straw management decision-making,"Blennow, K.; Anander, E.",Kristina Blennow,2025-08-29,scientific communication and education,"Sustainable bioenergy is central to climate change mitigation, yet biomass supply depends not only on biophysical and economic assessments but also on farmers decision-making. Straw from cereal and oilseed crops can support renewable energy, but its availability is constrained by on-farm uses, management practices, and farmers access to knowledge of sustainable soil management. Because straw removal affects soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, which underpins soil fertility, nutrient cycling, and carbon sequestration, understanding farmers motivations and informational needs is critical to support sustainable straw management.

We examined the determinants of straw management among farmers in Scania County, southern Sweden, testing three hypotheses: that manure application increases the likelihood of straw removal, that a higher proportion of leased land promotes straw removal, and that humus-rich soils are associated with a higher probability of straw removal. Survey data from 2021 were analysed using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) and permutation tests, incorporating farmers expected utility.

Results show that manure application increases removal probability, whereas a higher share of leased land reduces it. Removal was most frequent on soils with intermediate humus content. Cluster analysis identified three farmer profiles, revealing heterogeneous motivations and knowledge gaps, particularly regarding soil humus content, and underscoring the need for context-specific communication strategies.

These findings demonstrate that similar straw management behaviours can arise from diverse motivations and local conditions. Linking expectations, soil properties, and practices provides actionable insights for targeted advisory and policy measures that balance agronomic and economic outcomes with long-term SOC-mediated fertility, carbon sequestration, and ecosystem services."

Kitani,2025-09-03,scientific communication and education,"O_LIEnvironmental education plays a crucial role in raising public awareness of ecosystem conservation. Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis is a promising environmental education tool because it enables easy and comprehensive biodiversity assessment through simple water sampling. Despite several citizen-based surveys using eDNA analysis, minimal attention has been paid to its educational effectiveness.
C_LIO_LIIn this study, we examined the educational feasibility of eDNA analysis by conducting an environmental education program that incorporated eDNA-based local fish surveys in three high schools in Japan. Through detailed questionnaire surveys conducted before and after the program, we verified whether our program increased student interest in biodiversity and ecosystem services.
C_LIO_LIIn the program, students proactively identified diverse fish species living in the survey area by simply collecting water. The questionnaire survey results showed that student knowledge of and interest in biodiversity and ecosystem services increased after the program. Students became aware of local fish diversity and expressed their motivation to engage in conservation activities. We confirmed the educational impact of the program not only at the end but also immediately following the water sampling experience.
C_LIO_LISynthesis and applications. These results provide the first empirical evidence of the positive effects of eDNA analysis on student environmental awareness and engagement. Our program provides a feasible model for eDNA-based environmental education. Because eDNA analysis can be applied to diverse target taxa that are unique to a given area, similar environmental education programs can be conducted for various citizen groups worldwide. Our research also suggested that eDNA-based environmental education was effective for younger generations with varying levels of interest and experience in nature, showing significant potential for addressing the extinction of natural experiences and motivating citizens to participate in ecosystem conservation activities.

Using a virtual-reality (VR) paradigm, we tested how speakers delivering scientific talks perceive and respond to supportive vs. unsupportive audiences. We collected behavioral (eye contact, speech rate, motion expressiveness/openness), physiological (heart rate, EEG, breathing rate, pupil dilation), and self-report measures to assess audience effects. The unsupportive audience elicited greater negative affect, arousal, and anxiety, and higher perceived cognitive and social effort. Physiologically and behaviorally, speaking to the unsupportive audience slowed the speaking rate, and acoustic analyses further indicated greater emotional arousal and vocal dominance in the unsupportive condition. Finally, VR exposure reduced speaking anxiety overall. These findings highlight VR combined with physiological measurement as a powerful approach for investigating audience effects and social-communication processes, with clear implications for augmenting social intelligence and communication skills."

However, in Spain, the importance of sustainability in research is only starting to be recognised at a national level. We developed a scalable, visual-oriented communications strategy that was designed with input from scientific staff and included a live seminar and a coherent set of graphic materials. Five pillars were targeted: three key areas of consumption (energy, water, and plastic use), procurement, and colleague engagement. The scheme was piloted in two of the largest biomedical research centres in Spain: the Severo Ochoa Molecular Biology Centre (CBM) and the Spanish National Centre for Biotechnology (CNB). The pilot engaged 50 laboratories and services across both centres, of which 34 were followed up for 5 months. The results indicate engagement with sustainability measures and shifts toward best practice across metrics, including equipment switch-off, water use, plastic item reuse, and purchasing decisions. During the follow-up period, 23% of participants adopted new measures related to freezer maintenance, decluttering, or sample organization, 55% removed old data from storage to save energy, 100% reduced their use of lifts, and 94% discussed research sustainability with their laboratory/group. The findings also revealed key areas for improvement, including the management of shared resources and resistance to change protocols. These results offer a wide range of quantitative and qualitative insights to guide further efforts and scaling at regional and national levels.

A.",Selina A Ruzi,2025-09-19,scientific communication and education,"There have been repeated calls in the US for scientists to communicate the importance of biological collections to both a general public audience and to policy makers. Natural history museums that house both collections and research staff while maintaining online media presences, are well positioned to communicate that value. Our study aims to understand how these museums present themselves and their research and collections via YouTube. We created a standardized and repeatable 15-question codebook to categorize content and production choices in museum account YouTube posts. In total, we analyzed 437 videos posted by 28 natural history museums in the US in 2019 and 2023, showing that messages featuring museum science are uncommon. Instead, YouTube users are likely to encounter live event recordings or promotional content related to museum or exhibit information. Research and collections themed content represents an opportunity gap for museums to engage YouTube audiences in science. If natural history museums that maintain both collections and research staff want to answer the repeated calls of communicating the importance of collections in research, then we recommend either (1) incorporating research and collections into their other video types, and/or (2) looking to other YouTube channels, some of which are subsidiary to museum institutional accounts, as a model for research and collections content strategies."
